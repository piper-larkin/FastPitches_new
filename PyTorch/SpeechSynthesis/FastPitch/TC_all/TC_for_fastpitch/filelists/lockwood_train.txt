mels/lockwood_1980_008.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_008.pt|Well, yes, but then, of course, you know, I can remember when I go back to the days of my childhood and the neighborhood where I lived, um, there were a lot of, um, Victorian widows, and it was a generally recognized thing in the family that a daughter would stay home and look after her mama, one daughter never married.|12|64
mels/lockwood_1980_037.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_037.pt|Well, after that, before I, you ever found out what the word meant by yourself, and I can vividly remember my mother saying, and I only know that word, because I nursed the soldiers.|12|64
mels/lockwood_1980_058.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_058.pt|But, um, she and I have always kept in contact.|12|64

mels/lockwood_1980_027.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_027.pt|And when I talk about the films that I can remember, Dorothecish and Lillian Gish and, um, Esther Rolston, and, um, I can remember what I could must have been all of seven or eight years old, taking myself off to the Crystal Palace before it was burnt down.|12|64
mels/lockwood_1980_020.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_020.pt|So we were thoroughly spoiled, you know, and, um, the dressing rooms themselves were very roomy, and lovely, devanned, lie down on.|12|64
mels/lockwood_1980_028.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_028.pt|There was a great big cinema in the Crystal Palace, and one Christmas they were playing Peter Pan.|12|64

mels/lockwood_1980_025.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_025.pt|So I went to see all the pictures with her.|12|64
mels/lockwood_1980_032.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_032.pt|My mother couldn't, said that was far too much, so we had to wait till they came to stretch them all, Lewis Shum, or one of those places, and then we used to go and see it.|12|64
mels/lockwood_1951_033.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_033.pt|I've been a very first job.|12|35
mels/lockwood_1951_080.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_080.pt|Well, I think perhaps the most important thing to me would be, you know, something to keep my mind occupied.|12|35
mels/lockwood_1980_004.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_004.pt|Um, Edward VII's, um, mistresses, you know, everybody knows about all those ladies and the...|12|64

mels/lockwood_1951_036.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_036.pt|Perhaps that was the most rewarding experience I've had in my career so far.|12|35
mels/lockwood_1980_066.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_066.pt|And he was missing about the old days, and he was saying, how lovely it all was, and the wicked lady and everything, and I said, you've got a very short memory.|12|64
mels/lockwood_1980_056.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_056.pt|We only ever made one film together, and people seem to think we made so many together.|12|64
mels/lockwood_1980_049.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_049.pt|I mean, um, it's really rather mind boggling when you think what goes, what did people have asked me that question?|12|64
mels/lockwood_1980_007.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_007.pt|And, uh, she plays her final card at the very end of the play and, uh, it's, it's really a rather, um, nasty one, you know, it's, and, uh, that finally stops Toria marrying.|12|64
mels/lockwood_1951_017.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_017.pt|Oh, the Prelude to Act One.|12|35

mels/lockwood_1951_024.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_024.pt|Or neither Peter nor I had had anything to eat and we were both ravenously hungry.|12|35
mels/lockwood_1951_039.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_039.pt|I don't think I'm giving away a really great secret when I tell you that Peter flies by means of a wire which is hooked onto a special harness.|12|35

mels/lockwood_1972_001.pt|pitch/lockwood_1972_001.pt|and I was told by my agent that uh, shevalier was coming over to make a film in England called the Beloved Vagabond and all the young girls in the country who had any kind of promise or any kind of name were going to be tested and it was perfectly true they must have tested.|12|56

mels/lockwood_1980_035.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_035.pt|But, uh, the only shows I did before the age of 12 was charity, and, um, from 12 onwards, uh, I was, I did quite a few things.|12|64
mels/lockwood_1980_064.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_064.pt|And he was very touched, and the tears came into his eyes and everything.|12|64
mels/lockwood_1980_067.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_067.pt|And I, as I remember that very, I said, did I really say all those things?|12|64

mels/lockwood_1980_057.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_057.pt|We only did make the man and grey together, and that's another picture that people never forget.|12|64
mels/lockwood_1951_052.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_052.pt|Nothing at all to do with any fondness of mine for Boats.|12|35

mels/lockwood_1980_022.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_022.pt|Well, that was what I always wanted to be.|12|64
mels/lockwood_1980_080.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_080.pt|But, um, if you start thinking, what do I say next, you've had it.|12|64
mels/lockwood_1980_047.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_047.pt|They said the GI's, they were all flocking in to see it, and they'd all been all this talk about the cleavage, and they all insisted on going into the circle.|12|64
mels/lockwood_1980_033.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_033.pt|And, um, I can remember seeing Jack Buchanan, uh, with the little girl called Marjorie Robertson, who became an illegal.|12|64

mels/lockwood_1980_023.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_023.pt|I didn't think about being a, um, what they call a legit actress.|12|64
mels/lockwood_1980_003.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_003.pt|Well, the author has taken, I don't know how much, um, dramatic license with the character because, uh, she really is generally known as having been a very beautiful woman and a very glamorous woman who had was married to a man who was very unfaithful to her.|12|64
mels/lockwood_1980_026.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_026.pt|She always took me to the pictures.|12|64

mels/lockwood_1951_025.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_025.pt|The enchantment of the play made us forget all about it.|12|35
mels/lockwood_1980_024.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_024.pt|I wanted to be a musical comedy, because, um, my mother loved the theater, and she was, um, what they call nowadays a movie buff.|12|64

mels/lockwood_1951_079.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_079.pt|It gives me a feeling of fear.|12|35
mels/lockwood_1980_036.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_036.pt|I was in no cards, Cavalcade, and unfortunately I had to leave that because, um, I heard a four letter word in the theatre, and she said, you're never going to enter that theatre again, and I never did great to my disappointment.|12|64
mels/lockwood_1951_071.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_071.pt|Toots' enthusiasm for this record dates from her very first visit to the ballet.|12|35
mels/lockwood_1980_011.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_011.pt|And then, um, it's just the last scene that more than 30 years have passed.|12|64
mels/lockwood_1951_040.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_040.pt|When I was standing on a high rostrum in the wings and the man came to hook on the wire.|12|35

mels/lockwood_1951_078.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_078.pt|This music has the same effect on me as thunderstorms.|12|35
mels/lockwood_1980_051.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_051.pt|I really don't, because I mean, you know, I had such a strict, such a model upbringing, and everything was so totally different.|12|64
mels/lockwood_1980_039.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_039.pt|And, no, she encouraged me, because, um, you know, she enjoyed going to the theatre, and she enjoyed going to the cinema.|12|64

mels/lockwood_1980_001.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_001.pt|Oh yes, I, I know all about everybody because historical novels, historical biographies are my passion in life.|12|64
mels/lockwood_1980_002.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_002.pt|And, um, so I'm very up on all the royals from dating way back to heaven knows when.|12|64
mels/lockwood_1951_046.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_046.pt|Oh, because this music is tied up with my favourite period in history.|12|35
