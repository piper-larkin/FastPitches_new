mels/thatcher_1973_017.pt|pitch/thatcher_1973_017.pt|I think you might be thinking that well it is a very big responsibility and one's often conscious of it but in education it is shared you know.|18|48
mels/thatcher_1973_018.pt|pitch/thatcher_1973_018.pt|I don't know whether you realize that I have absolutely no control over what is taught in the schools.|18|48
mels/thatcher_1973_019.pt|pitch/thatcher_1973_019.pt|I can decide or try to decide how many new school buildings we shall have, how many teachers we shall have, where the money shall go but your teachers and governors of your school and local authorities have control over the subjects that are actually taught.|18|48
mels/thatcher_1973_020.pt|pitch/thatcher_1973_020.pt|So it's very much a shared responsibility.|18|48
mels/thatcher_1973_021.pt|pitch/thatcher_1973_021.pt|I think you should get one main benefit to take your O levels, your CSEs at 16 and I think some people you know at school thinking well they won't be able to say that now.|18|48
mels/thatcher_1973_022.pt|pitch/thatcher_1973_022.pt|So I think for the first time, I don't think you could have all one kind of school and really there's no point in putting two buildings, say a mile and a half or two miles apart and saying that's a grammar, that's a secondary modern two miles apart, we'll call them both the comprehensive.|18|48
mels/thatcher_1973_023.pt|pitch/thatcher_1973_023.pt|They've got to work as one school.|18|48
mels/thatcher_1973_024.pt|pitch/thatcher_1973_024.pt|Then I think there are sometimes when there's a lot to be said, forgetting a group of young people to who, but perhaps comparatively rarely but there is a place for it and say there should be none other.|18|48
mels/thatcher_1973_025.pt|pitch/thatcher_1973_025.pt|Because I don't think that would result in giving the best education to every single young person.|18|48
mels/thatcher_1973_026.pt|pitch/thatcher_1973_026.pt|Well I think ever since I've been at school, all of the pupils in the upper part of the school always have had because they've helped with the administration of the school, they've often helped the staff out and I think it's developed their sense of responsibility a great deal.|18|48
mels/thatcher_1973_027.pt|pitch/thatcher_1973_027.pt|No, they're not less than the upper stream in the upper forms, in the first and second forms.|18|48

mels/thatcher_1973_031.pt|pitch/thatcher_1973_031.pt|But I do think we also need to spend more on nursery education and getting better buildings in primary schools.|18|48
mels/thatcher_1973_032.pt|pitch/thatcher_1973_032.pt|And so for the first time we are starting a 10 year program to do that.|18|48
mels/thatcher_1973_033.pt|pitch/thatcher_1973_033.pt|Well I am putting a lot more money into education without being prime minister.|18|48
mels/thatcher_1973_034.pt|pitch/thatcher_1973_034.pt|Indeed the cost of education does go up and up and up and over the next 10 years which will be spending half as much again and indeed when if we get inflation it will be much, much more than that.|18|48
mels/thatcher_1973_035.pt|pitch/thatcher_1973_035.pt|And one of the main reasons is because there are more pupils in schools because you're staying on longer.|18|48
mels/thatcher_1973_036.pt|pitch/thatcher_1973_036.pt|We're trying to get a bigger proportion of teachers to the pupils and then more of you are wanting to go to college and university.|18|48
mels/thatcher_1973_037.pt|pitch/thatcher_1973_037.pt|So we are all the time putting more in both at the top end in the schools and with the expansion of nursery education as well.|18|48

mels/thatcher_1987_008.pt|pitch/thatcher_1987_008.pt|They were acting as they were later in the coal strike before my whole trade union laws were through this government.|18|62
