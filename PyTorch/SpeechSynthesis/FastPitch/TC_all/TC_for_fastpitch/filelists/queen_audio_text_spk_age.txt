wavs/queen_2001_001.wav|the terrorist outrages in the United States last September brought home to us the pain and grief of ordinary people the world over who find themselves innocently caught up in such evil.|17|75
wavs/queen_2001_002.wav|We look to the church to bring us together as a nation or as a community in commemoration and tribute.|17|75
wavs/queen_2001_003.wav|It is to the church that we turn to give meaning to these moments of intense human experience through prayer, symbol and ceremony.|17|75
wavs/queen_2001_004.wav|In these circumstances, so many of us, whatever our religion, need our faith more than ever to sustain and guide us.|17|75
wavs/queen_2001_005.wav|Every one of us needs to believe in the value of all that is good and honest.|17|75
wavs/queen_2001_006.wav|We need to let this belief drive and influence our actions.|17|75
wavs/queen_2001_007.wav|All the major faiths tell us to give support and hope to others in distress.|17|75
wavs/queen_2001_008.wav|We in this country have tried to bring comfort to all those who were bereaved, who who suffered loss or injury in September's tragic events, through those moving services at St. Paul's and more recently at Westminster Abbey.|17|75
wavs/queen_2001_009.wav|On these occasions and during the countless other acts of worship during this past year, we came together as a community of relations, friends and neighbours to draw strength in troubled times from those around us.|17|75
wavs/queen_2001_010.wav|I believe that strong and open communities matter, both in good times as well as bad.|17|75
wavs/queen_2001_011.wav|Certainly, they provide a way of helping one another.|17|75
wavs/queen_2001_012.wav|I would like to pay tribute to so many of you who work selflessly for others in your neighbourhood needing care and support.|17|75
wavs/queen_2001_013.wav|Communities also give us an important sense of belonging, which is a compelling need in all of us.|17|75
wavs/queen_2001_014.wav|We all enjoy moments of great happiness and suffer times of profound sadness.|17|75
wavs/queen_2001_015.wav|The happiness is heightened, the sadness softened when it is shared.|17|75
wavs/queen_2001_016.wav|But there is more than that.|17|75
wavs/queen_2001_017.wav|A sense of belonging to a group which has in common the same desire for a fair and ordered society helps to overcome differences and many other things.|17|75
wavs/queen_2001_018.wav|We are misunderstanding by reducing prejudices, ignorance and fear.|17|75
wavs/queen_2001_019.wav|We all have something to learn from one another, whatever our faith.|17|75
wavs/queen_2001_020.wav|Be it Christian or Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu or Sikh, whatever our background, whether we be young or old from town or countryside.|17|75
wavs/queen_2001_021.wav|This is an important lesson for us all during this festive season.|17|75
wavs/queen_2001_022.wav|For Christmas marks a moment to pause to reflect and believe in the possibilities of rebirth and renewal.|17|75
wavs/queen_2001_023.wav|Christ's birth in Bethlehem so long ago remains a powerful symbol of hope for a better future.|17|75
wavs/queen_2001_024.wav|After all the tribulations of this year, this is surely more relevant than ever.|17|75
wavs/queen_2001_025.wav|As we come together amongst family and friends and look forward to the coming year, I hope that in the months to come, we shall be able to find ways of strengthening our own communities as a sure support and comfort to us all.|17|75
wavs/queen_2001_026.wav|Whatever may lie ahead.|17|75
wavs/queen_2001_027.wav|May I in this my 50th Christmas message to you, once again wish every one of you a very happy Christmas.|17|75
wavs/queen_2008_3_1_001.wav|last year, Commonwealth heads of government met in Uganda on the edge of Lake Victoria, an agreed to an action plan for tackling climate change.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_1_002.wav|It was an appropriate place to do so, from there the waters of the River Nile began a three month journey to the Mediterranean.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_1_003.wav|The Nile throughout history has served humankind in many ways, but for all its impressive size and importance, this river is a fragile ecosystem, and its vulnerability grows with a number of people dependent upon it, so that a single incident of pollution upstream may affect the lives of countless numbers downstream.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_1_004.wav|The example of the Nile illustrates many of the challenges facing the global environment as a whole, which cannot alone sustain our lives as once it did.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_1_005.wav|The competition for fresh water by a growing population is itself becoming a source of potential conflict.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_1_006.wav|Our own attitudes to the environment and the use we put it to may have consequences for people on every continent and for every ocean and sea.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_1_007.wav|The impact of pollution falls unequally.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_1_008.wav|It is often those who pollute the least, notably in the world's least developed nations, who are closest to the razor's edge, most affected by the impact of climate change and least equipped to cope with it.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_1_009.wav|And it is important to remember that the environmental choices available in some countries may not be an option for others.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_1_010.wav|In some parts of the world, for example, fossil fuels can be used more sparingly, and buildings can be made of more efficient, sustainable materials.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_1_011.wav|But it is far harder to expect someone to adapt if he or she relies on the trees of a local forest for fuel, shelter, and livelihood.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_1_012.wav|If we recognise the interests and needs of the people who are most affected, we can work with them to bring about lasting change.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_1_013.wav|Happily, this approach has always been a strength of the Commonwealth.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_1_014.wav|An awareness of environmental issues is now widespread, with a determination that future generations should enjoy clean air, sufficient fresh water and energy without risking damage to the planet.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_1_015.wav|Fewer more aware or energetic in confronting climate change than young people, and we should support them.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_1_016.wav|In the Commonwealth, governments, businesses, communities, and individuals should each strive to match words and good intentions with deeds.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_1_017.wav|Every contribution has its part to play.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_1_018.wav|Whatever we do, wherever we live, our actions in defence of the environment can have a real and positive effect upon the lives of others, today and into the future.|17|82
wavs/queen_2000_001.wav|by any measure, this millennium year has been an unforgettable one.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_002.wav|Since the turn of the year, it has been celebrated and marked in this country and throughout the Commonwealth.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_003.wav|And it has been a particular pleasure for me to visit millennium projects, large and small, which will be reminders for generations to come of the time when the 21st century began.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_004.wav|But as this year draws to a close, I would like to reflect more directly and more personally on what lies behind all celebrations of these past 12 months.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_005.wav|Christmas is the traditional, if not the actual birthday of a man who was destined to change the course of our history.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_006.wav|And this is the true millennium anniversary.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_007.wav|The simple facts of Jesus' life give us little clue as to the influence he wants to have on the world.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_008.wav|As a boy he learned his father's trade as a carpenter.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_009.wav|He then became a preacher, recruiting 12 supporters to help him.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_010.wav|But his ministry only lasted a few years and he himself never wrote anything down.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_011.wav|In his early 30s, he was arrested, tortured and crucified with two criminals.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_012.wav|His death might have been the end of the story, but then came the resurrection and with it the foundation of the Christian faith.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_013.wav|Even in our history, the only thing that we can do is to look at our own spiritual life.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_014.wav|If you want to see an expression of Christian faith, you have only to look at our own inspiring cathedrals and abyss.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_015.wav|Listen to their music, or look at their stained glass windows, their books and their pictures.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_016.wav|But the true measure of Christ's influence is not only in the lives of the saints, but also in the good works, quietly done by millions of men and women day in and day out through the centuries.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_017.wav|Many will have been inspired by Jesus' simple but powerful teaching, love God and love thy neighbor as thyself.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_018.wav|In other words, treat others as you would like them to treat you.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_019.wav|His great emphasis was to give spirituality a practical purpose.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_020.wav|Whether we believe in God or not, I think most of us have a sense of the spiritual, that recognition of a deeper meaning and purpose in our lives.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_021.wav|And I believe that this sense flourishes despite the pressures of our world.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_022.wav|This spirituality can be seen in the teachings of other great faiths.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_023.wav|Of course, religion can be divisive, but the Bible, the Quran and the sacred text of the Jews and Hindus, Buddhists and Sikhs are all sources of divine inspiration and practical guidance passed down through the generations.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_024.wav|To many of us, our beliefs are of fundamental importance.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_025.wav|For me, the teachings of Christ and my own personal accountability before God provide a framework in which I try to lead my life.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_026.wav|I like so many of you have drawn great comfort in difficult times from Christ's words, an example.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_027.wav|I believe that the Christian message in the words of a familiar blessing remains profoundly important to us all.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_028.wav|Go forth into the world in peace.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_029.wav|Be of good courage.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_030.wav|Hold fast that which is good.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_031.wav|Render to no man evil for evil.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_032.wav|Strengthen the faint hearted.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_033.wav|Support the weak.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_034.wav|Help the afflicted.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_035.wav|Honor all men.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_036.wav|It is a simple message of compassion and yet as powerful as ever today, 2000 years after Christ's birth.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_037.wav|I hope this day will be as special for you as it is for me.|17|74
wavs/queen_2000_038.wav|May I wish you all a very happy Christmas.|17|74
wavs/queen_2002_001.wav|as I look back over these past 12 months, I know that it has been about as fully year as I can remember.|17|76
wavs/queen_2002_002.wav|But Christmas itself still remains a time for reflection and a focus of hope for the future.|17|76
wavs/queen_2002_003.wav|All great religions have such times of renewal, moments to take stock before moving on to face the challenges which lie ahead.|17|76
wavs/queen_2002_004.wav|Many of you will know only too well from your own experience, the grief that follows the death of a much loved mother or sister.|17|76
wavs/queen_2002_005.wav|Mine were very much part of my life and always gave me their support and encouragement.|17|76
wavs/queen_2002_006.wav|But my own sadness was tempered by the generous tributes that so many of you pay to the service they gave to this country and the wider Commonwealth.|17|76
wavs/queen_2002_007.wav|At such a difficult time, this gave me great comfort and inspiration as I faced up both to my own personal loss and to the busy Jubilee summer ahead.|17|76
wavs/queen_2002_008.wav|Anniversaries are important events in all our lives.|17|76
wavs/queen_2002_009.wav|Christmas is the anniversary of the birth of Christ over 2000 years ago.|17|76
wavs/queen_2002_010.wav|But it is much more than that.|17|76
wavs/queen_2002_011.wav|It is the celebration of the birth of an idea and an ideal.|17|76
wavs/queen_2002_012.wav|In a different way, I felt that the golden Jubilee was more than just an anniversary.|17|76
wavs/queen_2002_013.wav|The celebrations were joyous occasions, but they also seemed to evoke something more lasting and profound, a sense of belonging and pride in country, town or community.|17|76
wavs/queen_2002_014.wav|A sense of sharing a common heritage enriched by the cultural, ethnic and religious diversity of our 21st century society.|17|76
wavs/queen_2002_015.wav|I hope it also provided an occasion to acknowledge the progress of the past 50 years and the contributions of those who have done so much to make this country what it is today.|17|76
wavs/queen_2002_016.wav|Their leadership and example, their achievements in science, the arts and many other fields.|17|76
wavs/queen_2002_017.wav|These celebrations also gave opportunities to recognize the valuable work undertaken by so many people in service of their communities.|17|76
wavs/queen_2002_018.wav|It was a time to remind ourselves as the Christmas story does every year that we must never forget the plight of the disadvantaged and excluded, that we must respond to the needs of those who may be in distress or despair.|17|76
wavs/queen_2002_019.wav|Our modern world plays such heavy demands on our time and attention that the need to remember our responsibilities to others is greater than ever.|17|76
wavs/queen_2002_020.wav|It is often difficult to keep this sense of perspective through the ups and downs of everyday life, as this year has constantly reminded me.|17|76
wavs/queen_2002_021.wav|I know just how much I rely on my own faith to guide me through the good times and the bad.|17|76
wavs/queen_2002_022.wav|Each day is a new beginning.|17|76
wavs/queen_2002_023.wav|I know that the only way to live my life is to try to do what is right, to take the long view, to give of my best in all that the day brings and to put my trust in God.|17|76
wavs/queen_2002_024.wav|Like others of you who draw inspiration from your own faith, I draw strength from the message of hope in the Christian gospel.|17|76
wavs/queen_2002_025.wav|Fortified by this and the support you have given throughout the last 12 months, which has meant so much to me, I look forward to the new year, to facing the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, and to continuing to serve you to the very best of my ability each and every day.|17|76
wavs/queen_2002_026.wav|A happy Christmas to you all.|17|76
wavs/queen_2007_001.wav|one of the features of growing old is heightened awareness of change.|17|81
wavs/queen_2007_002.wav|To remember what happened 50 years ago means that it is possible to appreciate what has changed in the meantime.|17|81
wavs/queen_2007_003.wav|It also makes you aware of what has remained constant.|17|81
wavs/queen_2007_004.wav|In my experience, the positive value of a happy family is one of the factors of human existence that has not changed.|17|81
wavs/queen_2007_005.wav|The immediate family of grandparents, parents and children together with their extended family is still the core of a thriving community.|17|81
wavs/queen_2007_006.wav|Now today of course marks the birth of Jesus Christ.|17|81
wavs/queen_2007_007.wav|Among other things, it is a reminder that it is the story of a family, but of a family in very distressed circumstances.|17|81
wavs/queen_2007_008.wav|Mary and Joseph found no room at the inn.|17|81
wavs/queen_2007_009.wav|They had to make do in a stable and the newborn Jesus had to be laid in a manger.|17|81
wavs/queen_2007_010.wav|This was a family which had been shut out.|17|81
wavs/queen_2007_011.wav|Perhaps it was because of this early experience that throughout his ministry, Jesus of Nazareth reached out and made friends with people whom others ignored or despised.|17|81
wavs/queen_2007_012.wav|It was in this way that he proclaimed his belief that in the end we are all brothers and sisters in one human family.|17|81
wavs/queen_2007_013.wav|The Christmas story also draws attention to all those people who are on the edge of society, people who feel cut off and disadvantaged, people who for one reason or another are not able to enjoy the full benefits of living in a civilized and law-abiding community.|17|81
wavs/queen_2007_014.wav|For these people, the modern world can see a distant and hostile place.|17|81
wavs/queen_2007_015.wav|It is all too easy to turn a blind eye, to pass by on the other side and leave it to experts and professionals.|17|81
wavs/queen_2007_016.wav|All the great religious teachings of the world press him the message that everyone has a responsibility to care for the vulnerable.|17|81
wavs/queen_2007_017.wav|Fortunately, there are many groups and individuals, often unsung and unruarded, who are dedicated to ensuring that the outsiders are given a chance to be recognised and respected.|17|81
wavs/queen_2007_018.wav|However, each one of us can also help by offering a little time, a talent or a possession and taking a share in the responsibility for the well-being of those who feel excluded.|17|81
wavs/queen_2007_019.wav|And also today, I want to draw attention to another group of people who deserve our thoughts this Christmas.|17|81
wavs/queen_2007_020.wav|And I pray that all of you who are missing those who are dear to you will find strength and comfort in your families and friends.|17|81
wavs/queen_2007_021.wav|A familiar introduction to an annual Christmas Carol service contains the words, because this would most rejoice his heart.|17|81
wavs/queen_2007_022.wav|Let us remember in his name the poor and the helpless, the cold, the hungry and the oppressed, the sick and those who mourn, the lonely and the unloved.|17|81

wavs/queen_2010_003.wav|Take them.|17|84
wavs/queen_2010_004.wav|People can now use mobile phones to be an instant contact virtually anywhere in the world.|17|84
wavs/queen_2010_005.wav|Be it with a medical center in the Himalayan mountains in Asia, a Pacific Island school, a research facility at the South Pole, or even the International Space Station beyond this planet altogether.|17|84
wavs/queen_2010_006.wav|Advances in modern telecommunications are also having a marked economic effect on people from developing nations in the Commonwealth, helping to transform small to medium-sized businesses.|17|84
wavs/queen_2010_007.wav|The internet is playing an important part in helping to nurture these fledgling markets, but as yet, it still remains an unaffordable option for too many of our Commonwealth citizens.|17|84
wavs/queen_2010_008.wav|Progress in the fields of healthcare, manufacturing and education have for the most part helped improve people's lives throughout the world.|17|84
wavs/queen_2010_009.wav|In the health sector, the Commonwealth has shown how collaborative schemes can successfully assist member states to fight pandemics and diseases.|17|84
wavs/queen_2010_010.wav|In making these advances, the Commonwealth recognizes that the best forms of innovation are those that unite and help build resilient partnerships and better societies as a whole.|17|84
wavs/queen_2010_011.wav|This is particularly important for the more than half of the Commonwealth who are under 25 years of age.|17|84
wavs/queen_2010_012.wav|It is vital that their potential to build on the exceptional scientific expertise that exists in member states is also fully supported through education and social development.|17|84
wavs/queen_2010_013.wav|The Commonwealth understands this and should continue to aid and encourage our young people to participate in the exciting new opportunities that lie ahead.|17|84
wavs/queen_2010_014.wav|In the knowledge that progress is something which must be sustained and shared by all.|17|84
wavs/queen_2008_3_26_001.wav|it is a particular pleasure to welcome you both as our guests to win the castle this evening on the first day of your state visit to the United Kingdom.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_26_002.wav|The have of course been many state visits between our countries over the centuries, starting with the famous encounter between France is the first and Henry VIII of the field of cloth of gold in 1520.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_26_003.wav|This respectfully at competitive relationship between our two countries has been clear to see on many occasions in the intervening years.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_26_004.wav|Both countries are rightly ploughed proud and sometimes perhaps even a little jealous of our respective histories and of our contributions to global customs, business practices and cultures, contributions which far right way are geographical size.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_26_005.wav|And no one will ever win an argument with the respective merits of our rich and expressive.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_26_006.wav|But we must also recall and celebrate the depth of our common interest and friendship over many years.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_26_007.wav|Here in the first decade of the 21st century, I have a sense that our two countries are working increasingly closer together.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_26_008.wav|The internet, the Eurostar and even the camera phone have helped transform the way our respective populations interact.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_26_009.wav|Images are sent from the blink of an eye from the cow gorns to the Pyrenees, the time to the Rhine.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_26_010.wav|Even as I speak, people are moving by metro, train and tube, direct from the left bank of Paris to the west end of London, the northeast of England to the sudwurst in France and back again with comfort and ease.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_26_011.wav|With this in mind, it is no great surprise that people in our two countries have increasingly come to recognise that what is different is to be celebrated and what is similar should be embraced.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_26_012.wav|There are more and more exchanges between the students of our schools and colleges, soaring the seeds not just of new ideas but also of new friendships and affiliations that will serve as well in the years ahead.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_26_013.wav|Well over a third of a million French people now working Britain while increasing numbers of Britain's are choosing to live in France.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_26_014.wav|Not only culture, but economically, we are doing so much more together as our businesses continue to invest both ways across the channel.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_26_015.wav|There can be no better example of this cooperation than the landing last week at Heathrow of the world's biggest passenger plane, the Airbus A380, built in France with wings and engines made here in the United Kingdom.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_26_016.wav|With a growing spirit of mutual understanding on so many levels, we stand ready to face the global challenges ahead, knowing that when we work together we can produce effective and enduring results.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_26_017.wav|We see this in the joint commitment of France and the United Kingdom in Africa, which continues to be decisive.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_26_018.wav|And we are determined to turn what our own rivalries into common efforts to reduce conflict on that conflict continent, particularly in the area of education.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_26_019.wav|We see it also in climate change where our governments are together helping to influence and guide the international debate.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_26_020.wav|Within Europe, though we may just occasionally differ, we also far more often agree.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_26_021.wav|At the United Nations also, no two countries work more closely and effectively together in the vital area of conflict resolution.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_26_022.wav|And I would like to pay particular tribute this evening to all those French and British individuals, voluntary or professional within an outside government spanning all continents, who work as one towards greater levels of security, prosperity and peace of mind throughout the world.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_26_023.wav|Mr Le Président, close as neighbours, closer as partners, growing closer still as friends, our nations have much to celebrate.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_26_024.wav|I wish you and Madame Sarkozy a happy visit to this country.|17|82
wavs/queen_2008_3_26_025.wav|And I now ask everyone to raise their glasses and drink a toast to his excellence in the president of the French Republic, Madame Sarkozy and the people of France.|17|82
wavs/queen_1999_001.wav|a very happy Christmas to you all.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_002.wav|Listening to the choir from St. George's Chapel Windsor reminds me that this season of carols and Christmas trees is a time to take stock, a time to reflect on the events of the past year and to make resolutions for the New Year ahead.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_003.wav|And as I look to the future, I have no doubt at all that the one certainty is change and the pace of that change will only seem to increase.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_004.wav|This is true for all of us, young and old.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_005.wav|On my mother's 99th birthday last August, I was struck by how the inevitability of change affects us all and how different for my mother's early years compared with those of my grandchildren.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_006.wav|For many of their generation, the future is a source of excitement, hope and challenge.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_007.wav|For others, however, the future is a cause of understandable anxiety.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_008.wav|There are many, for example, of my age or amongst the more vulnerable in society who worry that they will be left behind.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_009.wav|The sheer rate of change seems to be sweeping away so much that is familiar and comforting.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_010.wav|But I do not think that we should be over anxious.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_011.wav|We can make sense of the future if we understand the lessons of the past.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_012.wav|Winston Churchill, my first Prime Minister, said that the further backward you look, the further forward you can see.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_013.wav|It was this importance of history which was much on my mind when I opened the new Scottish Parliament in July this year.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_014.wav|DeVillusion in Scotland and Wales, and more recently the very welcome progress in Northern Ireland, our responses to today's changed circumstances.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_015.wav|But they need to be seen in their historical contexts.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_016.wav|History and a common past have also played an important part in bringing together so many different nations into the modern Commonwealth.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_017.wav|This was a frequent theme last month at the Commonwealth Conference in South Africa.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_018.wav|At that meeting many of us highlighted the way in which the varied strands of our shared history have been woven together, so that we can more effectively address the challenges and opportunities ahead.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_019.wav|The Commonwealth, as with the process of devolution in the United Kingdom, reminds us of the importance of bringing the lessons of the past to bear on the aspirations for a better future.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_020.wav|To do this, we need to draw from our history those constant and unchanging values which have stood the test of time and experience.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_021.wav|Fannis and Compassion, Justice and Tolerance.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_022.wav|These are the landmarks from the past which can guide us through the years ahead.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_023.wav|These timeless values tell us above all about the way we should relate to people rather than to things, thinking of others not just of ourselves.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_024.wav|Earlier this autumn in Manchester, I visited some of the emergency services whose responsibilities day in and day out are based on concern for others.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_025.wav|As always, they are on duty over these Christmas and New Year holidays.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_026.wav|Up and down the country, people like those farming, nurses and ambulance men I met are working tirelessly to help others.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_027.wav|They remind us of the responsibility of each and every one of us to show concern for our neighbours and those less fortunate than ourselves.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_028.wav|I believe that this provides us with the direction and resolve required for the years ahead.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_029.wav|The future is not only about new gadgets, modern technology, or the latest fashion, important as these may be.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_030.wav|But the centre of all our lives, today and tomorrow, must be the message of caring for others, the message at the heart of Christianity and of all the great religions.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_031.wav|This message, love thy neighbour as thyself, may be for Christians 2000 years old.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_032.wav|But it is as relevant today as it ever was.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_033.wav|I believe it gives us the guidance and the reassurance we need as we step over the threshold into the 21st century.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_034.wav|And I for one, I'm looking forward to the new millennium.|17|73
wavs/queen_1999_035.wav|May I wish you all a Merry Christmas and in this year of all years of very happy New Year.|17|73
wavs/queen_1966_001.wav|ever since the first Christmas, when three wise men brought their presents, Christians all over the world have kept up this kindly custom.|17|40
wavs/queen_1966_002.wav|Even if the presents we give each other at Christmas time, they only be intended to give momentary pleasure.|17|40
wavs/queen_1966_003.wav|They do also reflect one all important lesson.|17|40
wavs/queen_1966_004.wav|Society cannot hope for a just and peaceful civilization unless each individual feels the need to be concerned about his fellows.|17|40
wavs/queen_1966_005.wav|All the great works of charity and all humanitarian legislation have always been inspired by a flame of compassion which has burned brightly in the hearts of men and women.|17|40
wavs/queen_1966_006.wav|Mankind has many blemishes, but deep down in every human soul, there is a store of goodwill waiting to be called upon.|17|40
wavs/queen_1966_007.wav|This year, I should like to speak especially to women.|17|40
wavs/queen_1966_008.wav|In many countries, custom has decreed that women should play a minor part in public affairs.|17|40
wavs/queen_1966_009.wav|It is difficult to realise that it was less than 50 years ago that women in Britain were first given the vote, but Parliament was first asked to grant this 100 years ago.|17|40
wavs/queen_1966_010.wav|Yet in spite of these disabilities, it has been women who have breathed gentleness and care into the harsh progress of mankind.|17|40
wavs/queen_1966_011.wav|The struggles against inhuman prejudice, against squalor, ignorance and disease have always owed a great deal to the determination and tenacity of women.|17|40
wavs/queen_1966_012.wav|The devotion of nuns and nurses, the care of mothers and wives, the service of teachers and the conviction of reformers are the rare and enduring presence which women have always given.|17|40
wavs/queen_1966_013.wav|In the modern world, the opportunities for women to give something of value to the human family are greater than ever, because through their own efforts, they are now beginning to play their full part in public life.|17|40
wavs/queen_1966_014.wav|We know so much more about what can be achieved.|17|40
wavs/queen_1966_015.wav|We know that the tyranny of ignorance can be broken.|17|40
wavs/queen_1966_016.wav|We know the rules of health and how to protect children from disease.|17|40
wavs/queen_1966_017.wav|We know all these things are important in our own homes, but it needs a very active concern by women everywhere, if this knowledge is to be used, where it is most needed.|17|40
wavs/queen_1966_018.wav|I am glad that in all countries of the Commonwealth, women are more and more able to use it.|17|40
wavs/queen_1966_019.wav|I am sure the custom of giving presence at Christmas will never die out, but I hope it will never ever shadow the far more important presence we can give for the benefit of the future of the world.|17|40
wavs/queen_1966_020.wav|People of Goodwill everywhere are working to build a world that will be a happier and more peaceful place in which to live.|17|40
wavs/queen_1966_021.wav|Let our prayers be for a personal strength and conviction to play our own small part to bring that day nearer.|17|40
wavs/queen_1966_022.wav|God be with you and a very happy Christmas to you all.|17|40
wavs/queen_1972_001.wav|my whole family has been deeply touched by the affection shown to us when we celebrated our silver wedding and we are especially grateful to the many thousands who have written to us and sent us messages and presents.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_002.wav|One of the great Christian ideals is a happy and lasting marriage between man and wife but no marriage can hope to succeed without a deliberate effort to be tolerant and understanding.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_003.wav|This doesn't come easily to individuals and it certainly doesn't come naturally to communities or nations.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_004.wav|We know only to well that a selfish insistence upon our rights and on our own point of view leads to disaster.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_005.wav|We all ought to know by now that a civilized and peaceful existence is only possible when people make the effort to understand each other.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_006.wav|Looking at the world, one might be forgiven for believing that many people have never heard of this simple idea.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_007.wav|Every day, there are reports of violence, lawlessness, and the disregard for human life.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_008.wav|Most of this is excused on purely selfish grounds.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_009.wav|I know there are millions of kindly people throughout the world who are saddened with me for all those who suffer from these outrages.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_010.wav|In the United Kingdom, we have our own particular sorrows in Northern Ireland and I want to send a special message of sympathy to all those men women and children who have suffered and endured so much.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_011.wav|But there is a light in this tragic situation.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_012.wav|The people are steadfastly carrying on their ordinary business and their factories and places of work.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_013.wav|Voluntary workers, both in the night of uniform, have struggled to keep humanity and common sense alive.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_014.wav|The social services have done their job magnificently.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_015.wav|The forces of law and order continue their thankless task with the utmost fortitude in the face of polling provocation.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_016.wav|We admire them greatly for their patience and restraint.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_017.wav|I ask you all to join me in praying that the hearts and minds of everyone in that trouble province may be touched with the spirit of Christmas and the message of brotherhood, peace, and good will.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_018.wav|May tolerance and understanding release the people from terror and put gladness in the place of fear.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_019.wav|But I am speaking today to all the peoples of the Commonwealth.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_020.wav|In this unique organisation, we are fortunate in having endless opportunities for cooperation.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_021.wav|Through its informal structure, we have created a web of relationships between peoples of many races and creeds and now between a great number of sovereign, independent states.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_022.wav|I have visited almost all of the 32 independent Commonwealth countries and we are looking forward to going back to Canada and Australia next year.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_023.wav|I know from this personal experience how much the Commonwealth is valued by its members.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_024.wav|Britain is about to join her neighbours in the European community and you may well ask how this will affect the Commonwealth.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_025.wav|The new links with Europe will not replace those with the Commonwealth.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_026.wav|They cannot alter our historical and personal attachments with kinsmen and friends overseas.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_027.wav|Old friends will not be lost.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_028.wav|Britain will take her Commonwealth links into Europe with her.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_029.wav|Britain and these other European countries see in the community a new opportunity for the future.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_030.wav|They believe that the things they have in common are more important than the things which divide them and that if they work together, not only they but the whole world will benefit.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_031.wav|We are trying to create a wider family of nations and it is particularly at Christmas that this family should feel closest together.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_032.wav|Christmas is above all a time of new life.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_033.wav|A time to look hopefully ahead to a future when the problems which face the world today will be seen in that true perspective.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_034.wav|I leave with you the old message on Earth Peace Goodwill toward men.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_035.wav|No one has ever offered a better formula and I hope that its simple truth may yet take hold of the imagination of all mankind.|17|46
wavs/queen_1972_036.wav|God bless you and a happy Christmas to all.|17|46
wavs/queen_1967_001.wav|everyone's in a while, an event occurs which seems to mark a milestone in history.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_002.wav|For the Commonwealth, such an event was Canada's centenary this year.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_003.wav|A hundred years ago, the Confederation of the Provinces of Canada laid the foundations for the country's subsequent development.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_004.wav|I very think it's inevitable that I should seem a rather remote figure to many of you.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_005.wav|A successor to the Kings and Queens of history, someone whose face may be familiar in newspapers and films, but who never really touches your personal lives.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_006.wav|But now, at least for a few minutes, I welcome you to the piece of my own home.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_007.wav|That it's possible for some of you to see me today is just another example of the speed at which things are changing all around us.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_008.wav|Because of these changes, I'm not surprised that many people feel lost and unable to decide what to hold on to and what to discard, how to take advantage of the new life without losing the best of the old.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_009.wav|But it's not the new inventions which are the difficulty.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_010.wav|The trouble is caused by unthinking people who carelessly throw away ageless ideals as if they were old and outworn machinery.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_011.wav|They would have religion thrown aside, morality and personal and public life made meaningless, honesty counted as foolishness, and self-interest set up in place of self-restraint.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_012.wav|At this critical moment in our history, we will certainly lose the trust and respect of the world if we just abandon those fundamental principles, which guided the men and women who built the greatness of this country and Commonwealth.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_013.wav|Today, we need a special kind of courage.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_014.wav|Not the kind needed in battle, but a kind which makes us stand up for everything that we know is right, everything that is true and honest.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_015.wav|We need the kind of courage that can withstand the subtle corruption of the cynics so that we can show the world that we are not afraid of the future.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_016.wav|It has always been easy to hate and destroy, to build and to cherish is much more difficult.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_017.wav|That's why we can take a pride in the new Commonwealth we are building.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_018.wav|This year, Ghana and Malaya joined our brotherhood.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_019.wav|Both these countries are entirely self-giveness, both achieve their new status, amicably and peacefully.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_020.wav|This advance is a wonderful tribute to the efforts of men of Goodwill who have worked together as friends, and I welcome these two countries with all my heart.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_021.wav|Last October, I opened the new Canadian Parliament, and as you know, this was the first time that any sovereign had done so in Ottawa.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_022.wav|Once again, I was overwhelmed by the loyalty and enthusiasm of my Canadian people.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_023.wav|Also during 1957, my husband and I paid visits to Portugal, France, Denmark and the United States of America.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_024.wav|In each case, the arrangements and formalities were managed with great skill, but no one could have managed the welcome we received from the people.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_025.wav|In each country, I was welcomed as head of the Commonwealth and as your representative.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_026.wav|These nations are our friends, largely because we've always tried to do our best to be honest and kindly, and because we have tried to stand up for what we believed be right.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_027.wav|In the old days, the monarch led his soldiers on the battlefield, and his leadership at all times was close and personal.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_028.wav|Today things are very different.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_029.wav|I cannot lead you into battle.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_030.wav|I do not give you laws, or minister justice, but I can do something else.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_031.wav|I can give you my heart and my devotion to these old islands and to all the peoples of our brotherhood of nations.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_032.wav|I believe in our qualities and in our strength.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_033.wav|I believe that together we can set an example to the world, which will encourage upright people everywhere.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_034.wav|I would like to read you a few lines from Pilderm's progress, because I'm sure we can say with Mr. Valiant for truth these words.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_035.wav|Though with great difficulty I am God hither, yet now I do not repent me of all the trouble I have been at to arrive where I am.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_036.wav|My sword I give to him that shall succeed me in my pilgrimage, and my courage and skill to him that can get it.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_037.wav|My marks and scars I carry with me to be a witness for me that I have fought his battles, who now will be my rewarder.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_038.wav|I hope that 1958 may bring you God's blessing and all the things you long for.|17|41
wavs/queen_1967_039.wav|And so I wish you all, young and old, wherever you may be, all the fun and enjoyment and the peace of a very happy Christmas.|17|41
wavs/queen_1998_001.wav|Christmas is a time for reflection and renewal.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_002.wav|For Christians, the years end has a special and familiar significance, but all faiths have their calendars, their signposts, which ask us to pause from time to time and think further than the hectic daily round.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_003.wav|We do that as individuals, with our families and as members of our local communities.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_004.wav|It is not always easy for those in their teens or 20s to believe that someone of my age, of the older generation, might have something useful to say to them, but I would say that my mother has much to say to me.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_005.wav|Indeed, have vigor and enjoyment of life is a great example of how to close the so-called generation gap.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_006.wav|She has an extraordinary capacity to bring happiness into other people's lives, and her own vitality and warmth is returned to her by those whom she meets.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_007.wav|But there are many of my mother's generation still with us.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_008.wav|They can remember the First World War.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_009.wav|Prince Philip and I can recall only the second.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_010.wav|I know that those memories of ours define us as old, but they are shared with millions of others in Britain and the Commonwealth, people who often feel forgotten by the march of time.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_011.wav|They remember struggles unknown to young people today, and which they will not forget.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_012.wav|Nor should their countries forget them.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_013.wav|And in recent days, we have had another reminder of the courage and dedication shown so often around the world by our armed forces in the cause of peace.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_014.wav|Memories such as these are a consequence of age, but not a virtue in themselves.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_015.wav|But with age does come experience, and that can be a virtue if it is disensably used.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_016.wav|Though we each lead different lives, the experience of growing older and the joys and emotions which it brings are familiar to us all.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_017.wav|It is hard to believe that a half century has passed since our son Charles was christened, and now last month he has celebrated his 50th birthday.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_018.wav|It was a moment of great happiness and pride on our part in all he has achieved during the last three decades.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_019.wav|As a daughter, a mother and a grandmother, I often find myself seeking advice or being asked for it in all three capacities.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_020.wav|No age group has a monopoly of wisdom, and indeed I think the young can sometimes be wiser than us.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_021.wav|But the older I get, the more conscious I become of the difficulties young people have to face.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_022.wav|As they learn to live in the modern world.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_023.wav|We parents and grandparents must learn to trust our children and grandchildren as they seize their opportunities.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_024.wav|But we can at the same time caution and comfort if things go wrong or guide and explain if we are needed.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_025.wav|My own grandchildren and their generation have a remarkable grasp of modern technology.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_026.wav|They are lucky to have the freedom to travel and learn about foreign cultures at an age when the appetite for learning is keen.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_027.wav|I see them pushing at the boundaries of science, sport and music of drama and discovery.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_028.wav|Last June Prince Philip and I gave a party for 900 of Britain's young achievers.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_029.wav|Buckingham Palace was brimming with young people who in their short lives have already set an example to us all.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_030.wav|They are living proof that the timeless virtues of honesty integrity, initiative and compassion are just as important today as they have ever been.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_031.wav|We hear much of public life, the hurly-burly of parliament, the media, big business, city life.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_032.wav|But for most people, their contribution at whatever age is made quietly through their local communities, just like so many of those young achievers.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_033.wav|To most of them service is its own reward.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_034.wav|Their public life is their church, their school, their sports club, their local council.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_035.wav|My work and the work of my family takes us every week into that quiet sort of public life, where millions of people give their time, unpaid and usually unsung to the community, and indeed to those most at risk of exclusion from it.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_036.wav|We see these volunteers at work in organisations such as the Scouts and Guides, the Cadet Force, the Red Cross and St John's, the Duke of Edinburgh's award scheme and the Princess Trust.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_037.wav|These organisations and those who serve them so selflessly provide the bridges across which the generations travel, meet and learn from one another.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_038.wav|They give us, with our families, our sense of belonging.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_039.wav|It is they that help define our sense of duty.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_040.wav|It is they that can make us strong as individuals and keep the nation's heartbeat strong and steady too.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_041.wav|Christmas is a good time for us to recognise all that they do for us and to say a heartfelt thank you to each and every one of them.|17|72
wavs/queen_1998_042.wav|Happy Christmas to you all.|17|72
wavs/queen_1971_001.wav|Christmas is the time for families and for children and it's also a time when we realise that another year is coming to an end.|17|45
wavs/queen_1971_002.wav|As the familiar pattern of Christmas and the new year repeats itself, we may sometimes forget how much the world about us has been changing.|17|45
wavs/queen_1971_003.wav|It was 39 years ago that my grandfather King George V gave the first of his Christmas broadcasts.|17|45
wavs/queen_1971_004.wav|He spoke about a future, which is now the past.|17|45
wavs/queen_1971_005.wav|Today it is our turn to think about the future.|17|45
wavs/queen_1971_006.wav|Many of you who are listening are able like me to enjoy this Christmas with your families and your children can enjoy the day as all children should.|17|45
wavs/queen_1971_007.wav|But tragically there are many millions of others for whom this cannot be the same.|17|45
wavs/queen_1971_008.wav|Our thoughts and prayers should be for them.|17|45
wavs/queen_1971_009.wav|Our children will be living in a world which our work and deeds have shaped for them.|17|45
wavs/queen_1971_010.wav|We cannot possibly tell what changes the next 40 years will bring.|17|45
wavs/queen_1971_011.wav|We do know that we are passing onto our children the path to change their whole environment.|17|45
wavs/queen_1971_012.wav|But we also leave them with a set of values which they take from our lives and from our example.|17|45
wavs/queen_1971_013.wav|The decisions they take and the sort of world they pass on to their children could be just as much affected by those values as by all the technological wonders of this age.|17|45
wavs/queen_1971_014.wav|The Christmas message is really one for all seasons and not just for one day of the year.|17|45
wavs/queen_1971_015.wav|If we can show this by our lives and by our example then our contribution as parents will be just as important as any made by scientists and engineers.|17|45
wavs/queen_1971_016.wav|Perhaps we can then look for the rail piece on earth and the powers which men of Hanest will be used for the benefit of our fellow men.|17|45
wavs/queen_1971_017.wav|I hope this Christmas day is bringing to many of you peace and happiness and for everyone the hope of this to come.|17|45
wavs/queen_1971_018.wav|May God bless you all.|17|45
wavs/queen_1965_001.wav|every year the familiar pattern of Christmas unfolds, the sights and the customs and festivities may seem very much the same from one year to another.|17|39
wavs/queen_1965_002.wav|And yet to families and individuals, each Christmas is slightly different.|17|39
wavs/queen_1965_003.wav|Children grow and presents for them change.|17|39
wavs/queen_1965_004.wav|It may be the first Christmas for many as husband and wife or the first Christmas with grandchildren.|17|39
wavs/queen_1965_005.wav|Some may be far from home and others learnly or sick.|17|39
wavs/queen_1965_006.wav|Yet Christmas always remains as the great family festival.|17|39
wavs/queen_1965_007.wav|A festival which we owe to that family long ago, which spent this time in extreme adversity and discomfort.|17|39
wavs/queen_1965_008.wav|I think we should remember that in spite of all the scientific advances and the great improvements in our material welfare, the family remains as the focal point of our existence.|17|39
wavs/queen_1965_009.wav|There is overwhelming evidence that those who cannot experience full and happy family life for some reason or another are deprived of a great stabilizing influence in their lives.|17|39
wavs/queen_1965_010.wav|At Christmas, we are also reminded that it is the time of peace on earth and goodwill towards men.|17|39
wavs/queen_1965_011.wav|Yet we are all only too well aware of the tragic fighting hatred and ill will in so many parts of the world.|17|39
wavs/queen_1965_012.wav|Because of this, cynics may shrug off the Christmas message as a waste of time.|17|39
wavs/queen_1965_013.wav|But that is only the gloomy side of the picture.|17|39
wavs/queen_1965_014.wav|There are also brighter and more hopeful signs.|17|39
wavs/queen_1965_015.wav|The great churches of the world are coming to understand each other better and to recognize that without their inspiration and great ideals, mankind will be smothered by its own material wealth.|17|39
wavs/queen_1965_016.wav|We must have dreams and ambitions for peace and goodwill and they must be proclaimed.|17|39
wavs/queen_1965_017.wav|Perhaps the most practical demonstration of goodwill towards men is to be found in the growing practice among young people to give some form of voluntary service to others.|17|39
wavs/queen_1965_018.wav|In Britain and throughout the world, they are coming forward to help old people or to serve in every kind of capacity where they may be needed at home and overseas.|17|39
wavs/queen_1965_019.wav|A new army is on the march which holds out the brightest hopes for all men kind.|17|39
wavs/queen_1965_020.wav|It serves in international work camps in areas hit by natural disasters or emergencies and in helping the poor backward or the hungry.|17|39
wavs/queen_1965_021.wav|Peace on earth, we may not have it at the moment, we may never have it completely.|17|39
wavs/queen_1965_022.wav|But we will certainly achieve nothing unless we go on trying to remove the causes of conflict between peoples and nations.|17|39
wavs/queen_1965_023.wav|Goodwill towards men is not a hollow phrase.|17|39
wavs/queen_1965_024.wav|Goodwill exists and when there is an opportunity to show it in practical form, we know what wonderful things it can achieve.|17|39
wavs/queen_1965_025.wav|To deny this Christmas message is to admit defeat and give up hope.|17|39
wavs/queen_1965_026.wav|It is a rejection of everything that makes life worth living and what is far worse, it offers nothing in its place.|17|39
wavs/queen_1965_027.wav|In fact, it is just because there are so many conflicts in the world today that we should reaffirm our hopes and beliefs in a more peaceful and a more friendly world in the future.|17|39
wavs/queen_1965_028.wav|This is just the moment to remind ourselves that we can all find some practical way to serve others and help to create a better understanding between people.|17|39
wavs/queen_1965_029.wav|To each one of you, I wish a very happy Christmas and if throughout the Commonwealth we can all make a sustained effort, perhaps Christmas next year will be much happier for many more people.|17|39
wavs/queen_1959_001.wav|I do not want Christmas to pass by without sending my best wishes for a happy day to all of you who may be listening and especially to my own people in the common world.|17|33
wavs/queen_1959_002.wav|I'm glad to have this chance to thank you all very warmly indeed.|17|33
wavs/queen_1959_003.wav|As the earlier passes, let us celebrate Christmas with Thanksgiving and carry its message of peace and goodwill into the year ahead.|17|33
wavs/queen_1959_004.wav|All of us at Sandlingham wish you a very happy Christmas.|17|33
wavs/queen_1959_005.wav|May God bless you all.|17|33
wavs/queen_1958_001.wav|I have a Christmas to you all.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_002.wav|Every year, I look forward to opening the letters, parcels and telegrams that come to me from all parts of the world.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_003.wav|My husband and children join me in thanking all of you who have sent us your good wishes for Christmas and the new year.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_004.wav|Some of you have written to say that you would like to see our children on television this afternoon.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_005.wav|We value your interest in them and I can assure you that we have thought about this a great deal before deciding against it.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_006.wav|We would like our son and daughter to grow up as normally as possible so that they will be able to serve you in the Commonwealth, faithfully and well when they are old enough to do so.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_007.wav|We believe that public life is not a fair burden to place on growing children.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_008.wav|I'm sure that all of you who are parents will understand.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_009.wav|Very soon now, we shall be entering into the uncertainty and promise of a new year.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_010.wav|I hope very much that it proves to be a year of progress and happiness for us all.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_011.wav|My family and I are looking forward to it, especially because many of us will be traveling to different parts of the world and hope to see more of you than ever before.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_012.wav|In three weeks time, my husband goes to India and Pakistan and then on across the Pacific.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_013.wav|My mother is going to East Africa and my uncle, the Dupu Blaster and his wife, will be traveling as my representatives to Nigeria.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_014.wav|My aunt, the Duchess of Kent and my cousin, Princess Alexandra, are also undertaking long journeys.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_015.wav|Together, they will be visiting Central and South America in the spring.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_016.wav|And later, Princess Alexandra goes to Australia to attend the centenary celebrations of the State of Queensland.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_017.wav|In June, my husband and I will be going to Canada once again.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_018.wav|You'll remember that my sister Princess Margaret was there earlier this year.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_019.wav|This time, we go primarily to open the Great St Lawrence Seaway, but we should be visiting many other parts of the country as well.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_020.wav|Lastly, towards the end of the year, we are going to Ghana and on our way back, we intend to visit my people in Sierra Leone and the Gambia.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_021.wav|So, between us, we are going to many parts of the world.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_022.wav|We've no plans for space travel at the moment.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_023.wav|Two Christians all over the world.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_024.wav|Christmas is an occasion for family gatherings and celebrations.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_025.wav|For presents and parties, for friendship and goodwill.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_026.wav|To many of my people, Christmas doesn't have the same religious significance, but friendship and goodwill are common to us all.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_027.wav|So, it's a good time to remember those around us who are far from home, feeling perhaps strange and lonely.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_028.wav|My own thoughts are with the men and women and children from other parts of the Commonwealth who have come to live and work in the great cities of this country, and may well be missing the warmth and sunshine of their homeland.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_029.wav|In recent years, the Commonwealth countries have been making a great cooperative effort to raise standards of living.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_030.wav|Even so, the pace of our everyday life has been such that there's hardly been enough time to enjoy the things which appeal to men's minds and which make life a full experience.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_031.wav|After all, our standard of living has a spiritual as well as a material aspect.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_032.wav|The geniuses of scientists, inventors and engineers can make life more comfortable and prosperous.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_033.wav|But throughout history, the spiritual and intellectual aspirations of mankind have been inspired by prophets and dreamers, philosophers, men of ideas and poets, artists in paint, sculpture and music.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_034.wav|The whole company who challenge and encourage or who entertain and give pleasure.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_035.wav|To their number, I would add the teachers in church, school and university, whose enormous job it is to awaken the minds of the younger generations and instill into them the essence of our accumulated civilization.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_036.wav|I am sure that many of you have thought about these things before.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_037.wav|But it seems to me that Christmas is just the time to be grateful to those who add fullness to our lives.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_038.wav|Even so, we need something more.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_039.wav|We all need the kind of security that one gets from a happy and united family.|17|32
wavs/queen_1958_040.wav|Before I return to mine, let me once again wish every one of you a very happy Christmas from all of us here at Sandrium and make God's blessing be with you in the coming year.|17|32
wavs/queen_1964_001.wav|as|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_002.wav|I begin my Christmas broadcast to you, the people of Great Britain, and of the other Commonwealth countries, my mind travels far away, and for one moment I seem to be with you in many countries, which are now almost as familiar as my own native land.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_003.wav|To all my family and I send our affectionate greetings and hope that your Christmas is a happy one.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_004.wav|Let us think for a moment about this great Commonwealth.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_005.wav|What is this wealth which we have in common and which is so much more than our collective resources, massive there they are?|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_006.wav|I know that life is hard for many, the problems which face mankind often seem to defy solution.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_007.wav|Some of our Commonwealth friends overseas are grappling with difficulties unknown in a complex industrial country such as Great Britain.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_008.wav|There are difficulties of overpopulation, there is hunger, and drought, and lack of power.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_009.wav|There are yearly tens of thousands of young people flocking into schools seeking education.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_010.wav|I welcome the chance of hearing more about these problems when individual ministers from the Commonwealth come to this country, and also on such special occasions as the Prime Minister's meetings.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_011.wav|At moments like this, I have the benefit not only of getting to know some of my Prime Minister's better, but of welcoming leaders from the new nations of the Commonwealth.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_012.wav|I value very highly these meetings which allow me to draw on the wisdom of such a representative gathering.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_013.wav|I believe that in God's good time, all the peoples of our Commonwealth working side by side will attain prosperity.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_014.wav|The thread which runs through our Commonwealth is love of freedom, and it is perhaps in this more than anything else that our rail well flies.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_015.wav|Now the word freedom, like the word democracy, is a simple one, implying a simple idea, and yet freedom to be effective must be disciplined.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_016.wav|Absolute freedom is a state unlearned to the historian.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_017.wav|The many ancient institutions and traditions which we have inherited and which are familiar to us all provide a framework and a dignified background to our way of life.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_018.wav|If it is not to degenerate, freedom must be maintained by a thousand invisible forces.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_019.wav|Self-discipline, the common law, the right of citizens to assemble and to speak and argue.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_020.wav|We do not wish to impose a particular form of government on any peoples in the world.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_021.wav|We merely say, this is what we do.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_022.wav|We know it's not perfect, but it's the best system that we have been able to create after many centuries of trial and error.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_023.wav|All of us who have been blessed with young families know from long experience that when one's house is at its noisiest, there is often less cause for anxiety.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_024.wav|The creaking of a ship in a heavy sea is music in the ears of the captain on the bridge.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_025.wav|In fact, little is static, and without movement there can be no progress.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_026.wav|Some speak today as they are the age of adventure and initiative is passed.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_027.wav|On the contrary, never have the challenges been greater or more urgent.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_028.wav|The fight against poverty, malnutrition and ignorance is harder than ever.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_029.wav|And we must do all in our power to see that science is directed towards solving these problems.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_030.wav|I would like to say one more word to the young people of the Commonwealth.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_031.wav|Upon you rests our hope for the future.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_032.wav|You young people are needed.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_033.wav|There is a great task ahead of you, the building of a new world.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_034.wav|You have brains and courage, imagination and humanity.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_035.wav|Direct them to the things that have to be achieved in this century if mankind is to live together in happiness and prosperity.|17|38
wavs/queen_1964_036.wav|God bless you and a very, very happy Christmas to you all.|17|38
wavs/queen_1970_001.wav|every year we are reminded that Christmas is a family festival, a time for reunion and a meeting point for the generations.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_002.wav|This year I'm thinking of rather a special family, a family of nations, as I recall fascinating journeys literally to our precedents of the world.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_003.wav|During the course of these visits we met and talked to the great number of people in every sort of occupation and living in every kind of community and climate.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_004.wav|Yet in all this diversity they had one thing in common.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_005.wav|They were all members of the Commonwealth family.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_006.wav|Earlier this year we went to Fiji, Tonga, New Zealand and Australia in Britannia.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_007.wav|We were following the path taken in 1770 by that great English discoverer, Captain Cook.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_008.wav|A little later in the year we were in Canada.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_009.wav|Still in the Commonwealth visiting the Northwest Territories and Manitoba for their centenaries.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_010.wav|Among people who are so essentially New Zealanders, Canadians or Australians, it struck me again that so many of them still have affectionate and personal links with the British Isles.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_011.wav|Wherever I went among people living in the busy industrial towns or on the stations and farms of the far outback, I met newcomers who reminded me that these links between our countries are renewed every year.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_012.wav|In Canada we met some of the older inhabitants, Indians, people whose ancestors were there for generations before the Europeans came.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_013.wav|And further north still lived the Eskimos, some of the most interesting people that we met during our travels this year.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_014.wav|They too belonged to the Commonwealth family, this remarkable collection of friendly people of so many races.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_015.wav|Later in the year representatives from 42 different parts of the world gathered to attend the Commonwealth Games.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_016.wav|There are many unpublished meetings, but it is not often that the Commonwealth is able to get together for a great public ceremony.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_017.wav|On this occasion it was sport that brought them to Scotland and they came to compete and to enjoy themselves.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_018.wav|We entertained them all in the garden of our home in Edinburgh.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_019.wav|And I was very conscious that each of the athletes I met represented a country as different and interesting as those I had been able to visit during the year.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_020.wav|Never before has there been a group of independent nations linked in this way by their common history and continuing affection.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_021.wav|Too often we hear about the Commonwealth only when there is bad news about one of its members or when it is usefulness or its very existence is questioned.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_022.wav|Britain and other members responded generously after the terrible disaster in East Pakistan.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_023.wav|But the fellowship of the Commonwealth does not exist only at such unhappy times.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_024.wav|Many of us here in Britain have relatives living in other Commonwealth countries and there are many who were born overseas living here.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_025.wav|Because it is Christmas we are probably thinking of them now.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_026.wav|It is these personal contexts which mean so much.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_027.wav|The strength of the Commonwealth lies in its history and the way people feel about it.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_028.wav|All those years through which we have lived together have given us an exchange of people and ideas which ensures that there is a continuing concern for each other.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_029.wav|That very simply is the message of Christmas.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_030.wav|Learning to be concerned about one another, to treat your neighbour as you would like him to treat you and to care about the future of all life on earth.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_031.wav|These matters of the spirit are more important and more lasting than simple material development.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_032.wav|It is a hard lesson but I like to think that we in the Commonwealth have perhaps begun to understand it.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_033.wav|I wish you a Merry Christmas.|17|44
wavs/queen_1970_034.wav|God bless you all.|17|44
wavs/queen_1960_001.wav|I'm glad at Christmas time to have this opportunity of speaking directly to all the people of the common world and of sending you my good wishes.|17|34
wavs/queen_1960_002.wav|My husband and our children together with the other members of our family, join me in wishing everyone of you a happy Christmas and a prosperous new year.|17|34
wavs/queen_1960_003.wav|I make no excuse for telling you once again for the kind messages which reach us from all over the world at this season.|17|34
wavs/queen_1960_004.wav|Give us great pleasure and encouragement.|17|34
wavs/queen_1960_005.wav|This year, I was delighted to get so many when my second son was born.|17|34
wavs/queen_1960_006.wav|The telegrams and letters which came flooding in at that time made me feel very close to all the family groups throughout the common world.|17|34
wavs/queen_1960_007.wav|It is this feeling of personal association which gives the people of the commonwealth countries that special relationship one to another which others find so difficult to understand.|17|34
wavs/queen_1960_008.wav|It is because of this that my husband and I are so greatly looking forward to our visits to India and Pakistan early next year and later on to Ghana, Sierra Leone and the Gambia.|17|34
wavs/queen_1960_009.wav|By no stretch of the imagination, can 1960 be described as a happy or successful year for mankind.|17|34
wavs/queen_1960_010.wav|Arguments and strange relations as well as natural disasters have all helped to produce an atmosphere of tension and uncertainty all over the world.|17|34
wavs/queen_1960_011.wav|Although the causes are beyond the control of individuals, we can at least influence the future via everyday behaviour.|17|34
wavs/queen_1960_012.wav|It is a times of change, disorder and uncertainty that we should cling most strongly to all those principles which we know to be right and good.|17|34
wavs/queen_1960_013.wav|Civilisation as we know it or would like it to be depends upon a constant striving towards better things.|17|34
wavs/queen_1960_014.wav|In times of stress such as we are living through only a determined effort by men and women of goodwill everywhere can hold and reverse a growing tendency towards violence and disintegration.|17|34
wavs/queen_1960_015.wav|Despite the difficulties, there are encouraging signs.|17|34
wavs/queen_1960_016.wav|For instance, in Africa, Nigeria has gone through the process of achieving full self-government in peace and goodwill.|17|34
wavs/queen_1960_017.wav|This great nation of 30 million people has decided to remain a member of our commonwealth and I know that her influence will be most valuable as the future unfolds in other parts of Africa.|17|34
wavs/queen_1960_018.wav|Then again, cooperation between commonwealth countries grows every year.|17|34
wavs/queen_1960_019.wav|And the understanding and mutual appreciation which is developing at the same time is one of the rarely bright spots in the world today.|17|34
wavs/queen_1960_020.wav|Although the contribution which any one person can make is small, it is real and important.|17|34
wavs/queen_1960_021.wav|Whether you live in one of the rapidly developing countries of the commonwealth or whether you find yourself in one of the older countries, the work of mutual help and the increase of mutual understanding cannot fail to be personally satisfying and of real service to the future.|17|34
wavs/queen_1960_022.wav|May the months ahead bring you joy and the peace and happiness which we so much desire.|17|34
wavs/queen_1960_024.wav|God bless you all.|17|34
wavs/queen_1961_001.wav|every year at this time, the whole Christian world celebrates the birth of the founder of our faith.|17|35
wavs/queen_1961_002.wav|It is traditionally the time for family reunions, present giving, and children's parties.|17|35
wavs/queen_1961_003.wav|A welcome escape, in fact, from the harsh realities of this troubled world.|17|35
wavs/queen_1961_004.wav|And it is just in times like these, times of tensions and anxieties, that the simple story and message of Christmas is most relevant.|17|35
wavs/queen_1961_005.wav|The story is of a poor man and his wife, who took refuge at night in a stable, where a child was born and laid in the manger.|17|35
wavs/queen_1961_006.wav|Nothing very spectacular, and yet the event was greeted with that triumphant song, glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace goodwill towards men.|17|35
wavs/queen_1961_007.wav|For that child was to show that there is nothing in heaven and earth, but cannot be achieved by faith and by love and service to one's neighbor.|17|35
wavs/queen_1961_008.wav|Christmas may be a Christian festival, but its message goes out to all men, and it is echoed by all men of understanding and goodwill everywhere.|17|35
wavs/queen_1961_009.wav|During this last year, I have been able to visit many countries, some are members of the Commonwealth, and some are not.|17|35
wavs/queen_1961_010.wav|In all of them, I was shown a genuine kindness and affection which touched me deeply, and showed, I think, that the British people are looked upon us friends in many parts of the world.|17|35
wavs/queen_1961_011.wav|In Asia and in Africa, we were made aware of the great volume of goodwill and friendship that exists between all the varied peoples who profess different faiths and who make up our Commonwealth family.|17|35
wavs/queen_1961_012.wav|To them, their Christian brethren send a message of hope and encouragement for Christmas.|17|35
wavs/queen_1961_013.wav|It goes also to the quiet people who fight prejudice by example, who stick to standards and ideals in face of persecution, who make rail sacrifices in order to help and serve their neighbors.|17|35
wavs/queen_1961_014.wav|Oh, hush the noise in men of strife and hear the angel sing.|17|35
wavs/queen_1961_015.wav|The words of this old Carol mean even more today than when they were first written.|17|35
wavs/queen_1961_016.wav|We can only dispel clouds of anxiety by the patient and of terminus efforts of us all.|17|35
wavs/queen_1961_017.wav|It cannot be done by condemning the past or by contracting out of the present.|17|35
wavs/queen_1961_018.wav|Angry words and accusations certainly don't do any good, however justified they may be.|17|35
wavs/queen_1961_019.wav|It is natural that the younger generation should lose patience with their elders, for they are seeming failure to bring some order and security to the world.|17|35
wavs/queen_1961_020.wav|But things will not get any better if young people merely express themselves by indifference or by revulsion against what they regard as an out of date order of things.|17|35
wavs/queen_1961_021.wav|The world desperately needs their vigor, their determination and their service to their fellow men.|17|35
wavs/queen_1961_022.wav|The opportunities are there and the reward is the satisfaction of truly unselfish work.|17|35
wavs/queen_1961_023.wav|To both young and old, I send my very best wishes.|17|35
wavs/queen_1961_024.wav|And as the Carol says, may we all hear the angel sing in the coming year.|17|35
wavs/queen_1961_025.wav|A very happy Christmas to you all.|17|35
wavs/queen_1988_001.wav|in the year just passed, Prince Philip and I have joined in the celebration of some notable anniversaries.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_002.wav|The events which they marked were hundreds of years apart, but each was important enough to get much attention in 1988.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_003.wav|The earliest event which we remembered was the encounter with the Spanish Armada in 1588.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_004.wav|The 400th anniversary fell in the same year in which we were able to mark the happy relations between Britain and Spain, which now exist by our state visit to Madrid.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_005.wav|400 years after the winds blew and the Spanish ships were scattered, the events were remembered without animosity in both countries.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_006.wav|This year the present king of Spain showed me the rooms in the Escorial where his predecessor Philip II planned the campaign had the fortunes of war gone against us, having a differently events in Britain and Europe would have unfolded.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_007.wav|Earlier in the year we marked another event of the first importance in our history, the 300th anniversary of what is popular in own as the glorious revolution.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_008.wav|The invitation to King William and Queen Mary to accept the thrones of England and Scotland finally laid to rest the enterprise of England which Philip of Spain set in hand.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_009.wav|It thus gave the particular direction to our history which was to lead to the development of parliamentary democracy and the tradition of political and religious toleration which Britain enjoys today.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_010.wav|It was a great pleasure for us to celebrate that event in the company of the Crown Prince of the Netherlands, together we visited Torbe, which was working William landed in 1688.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_011.wav|It was shrouded with fog when we were there but we did manage to see through the mist some of the hundreds of British and Dutch yachts that had assembled there.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_012.wav|The 1988 anniversary season opened in Australia with a grand party on Australia Day to mark the country's 200th birthday.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_013.wav|It was a party which went on for most of the year but Prince Philip and I joined in the festivities in April and May.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_014.wav|Like so many visitors in bicentennial year we brought home some souvenirs of our visit.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_015.wav|In our case it was some delightful early Prince of Sydney which served to remind us of the extraordinary developments which have taken place in Australia in the short space of 200 years.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_016.wav|The scenes of Sydney Harbour contrast vividly with the pictures we all saw of the crowded waters around the Opera House and the famous bridge in January this year.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_017.wav|Centenaries may seem rather arbitrary occasions but they nonetheless prompt us to look back into the past.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_018.wav|When we do so we can draw hope from seeing how ancient enmities have vanished and how new nations have grown and established themselves in vigor and wisdom.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_019.wav|Equally they make us reflect on injustices and tragedies and inspire us to do our best to learn from these as well.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_020.wav|To do that we surely should draw inspiration from one other anniversary the one we celebrate every year at this time the birth of Christ.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_021.wav|There are many grand and splendid pictures in the Royal Collection that illustrate this event but one which gives me particular pleasure is a precious almost jewel-like book.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_022.wav|It is a book of hours full of prayers and devotional readings.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_023.wav|It's in Latin but it contains the most exquisite illuminations and it is these that speak to us most movingly.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_024.wav|The anonymous person who drew the pictures nearly 500 years ago has included all the familiar elements of the Christmas story which we hear with such pleasure every year.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_025.wav|We find the angels bringing the glad tidings to the shepherds who listen attentively.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_026.wav|The baby Jesus lies in his stall with Mary and Joseph watching over him.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_027.wav|The star over the stable has lit the wave all of us ever since and there should be no one who feels shut out from that welcoming and guiding light.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_028.wav|The legends of Christmas about the ox and the ass suggest that even the animals are not outside that loving care.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_029.wav|Recently many of you will have set up and decorated a Christmas tree in your homes.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_030.wav|Often these are put by a window and the bright and shining tree is there for every passerby to see and share.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_031.wav|I like to think that if someone who feels lonely and unloved should see such a tree that person might feel it was meant for me.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_032.wav|May the Christmas story encourage you for it is a message of hope every year not for a few but for all.|17|62
wavs/queen_1988_033.wav|So in sending you my Christmas greeting I pray that God may bless you everyone.|17|62
wavs/queen_1963_001.wav|Since my last message of Christmas greetings do you all?|17|37
wavs/queen_1963_002.wav|The world has witnessed many great events and sweeping changes, but they are already part of the long record of history.|17|37
wavs/queen_1963_003.wav|The Christmas message of peace on earth, goodwill toward men, remains the same, but we can only achieve this if we are all truly ambitious for what is good and honorable.|17|37
wavs/queen_1963_004.wav|Humanity can only make progress by determination and concerted effort.|17|37
wavs/queen_1963_005.wav|One such concerted effort has been the campaign to free the world from hunger.|17|37
wavs/queen_1963_006.wav|I'm very happy to know that the people of the Commonwealth have responded so generously to this campaign.|17|37
wavs/queen_1963_007.wav|Much has been achieved, but there is still much to do, and on this day of reunions and festivities in the glow of Christmas, so just remember the many undenourished people young and old scattered throughout the world.|17|37
wavs/queen_1963_008.wav|All my family joins me in sending everyone of you best wishes for Christmas and may God's blessing be with you in the coming year.|17|37
wavs/queen_1952_001.wav|each Christmas at this time, my beloved father broadcast a message to his people in all parts of the world.|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_002.wav|today, I am doing this to you who are now my people.|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_003.wav|as he used to do, I am speaking to you from my own home, where I am spending Christmas with my family.|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_004.wav|and let me say it once, how I hope that your children are enjoying themselves as much as mine are on a day which is especially the children's festival,|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_005.wav|kept in honor of the child born at Bethlehem nearly 2000 years ago.|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_006.wav|most of you to whom I am speaking will be in your own homes.|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_007.wav|but I have a special thought for those who are saving their country in distant lands far from their families.|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_008.wav|wherever you are, either at home or away, in snow or in sunshine, I give you my affectionate greetings with every good wish for Christmas and the new year.|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_009.wav|at Christmas, our thoughts are always full of our homes and our families.|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_010.wav|this is the day when members of the same family try to come together or if separated by distance or events, meet in spirit and affection by exchanging greetings.|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_011.wav|but we belong, you and I, to a far larger family.|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_012.wav|we belong all of us to the British Commonwealth and Empire,|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_013.wav|that immense union of nations with our homes set in all the four corners of the earth.|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_014.wav|like our own families, it can be a great power for good,|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_015.wav|a force which I believe can be of immeasurable benefit to all humanity.|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_016.wav|my father and my grandfather before him worked all their lives to unite our peoples evermore closely and to maintain its ideals which were senior to their hearts.|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_017.wav|I shall strive to carry on their work.|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_019.wav|for, since my accession ten months ago,|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_020.wav|your loyalty and affection have been an immense support and encouragement.|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_021.wav|I want to take this Christmas day my first opportunity to thank you with all my heart.|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_022.wav|many grave problems and difficulties confront us all.|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_023.wav|but with a new faith in the old and splendid beliefs given us by our forefathers and the strength to venture beyond the safeties of the past,|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_024.wav|I know we shall be worthy of our duty.|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_025.wav|Above all, we must keep alive that courageous spirit of adventure,|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_026.wav|that is the finest quality of youth.|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_027.wav|and by youth, I do not just mean those who are young in years,|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_028.wav|I mean to all those who are young in heart no matter how old they may be.|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_029.wav|let's bid it still flourishes in this old country and in all the younger countries of our commonwealth.|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_030.wav|on this broad foundation, let us set out to build a true knowledge of ourselves and our fellow men.|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_031.wav|to work for tolerance and understanding among the nations,|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_032.wav|and to use the tremendous forces of science and learning for the betterment of man's lot upon this earth.|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_033.wav|if we can do these three things with courage, with generosity and with humility, then surely we shall achieve that peace on earth goodwill toward men, which is the eternal message of Christmas and the desire of us all.|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_034.wav|at my coronation next June, I shall dedicate myself a new to your service.|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_035.wav|I shall do so in the presence of a great congregation, drawn from every part of the commonwealth and empire.|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_036.wav|while millions outside with Mr. Abbey will hear the promises and the prayers being offered up within its walls,|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_037.wav|and see much of the ancient ceremony in which kings and queens before me have taken part through century upon century.|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_038.wav|you will be keeping it as a holiday.|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_039.wav|but I want to ask you all, whatever your religion may be, to pray for me on that day,|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_040.wav|to pray that God may give me wisdom and strength to carry out the solemn promises I shall be making,|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_041.wav|and that I may faithfully serve him and you all the days of my life.|17|26
wavs/queen_1952_042.wav|may God bless and guide you all through the coming year.|17|26
wavs/queen_1985_001.wav|looking at the morning newspapers, listening to the radio and watching television.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_002.wav|It is only too easy to conclude that nothing is going right in the world.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_003.wav|All this year we seem to have had nothing but bad news, with a constant stream of reports of pain crashes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and famine.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_004.wav|And as if natural disasters were not enough, we hear of rats, wars, acts of terrorism and generally of man's inhumanity to man.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_005.wav|It used to be said that no news is good news, but today you might well think that good news is no news.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_006.wav|Yet there is a lot of good news and some wonderful things are going on in spite of the frightening headlines.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_007.wav|Just think of the quiet courage and dedication of the peacekeepers and the rescue workers and all those who work so hard to restore shattered lives and disrupted communities.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_008.wav|I'm in the fortunate position of being able to meet many of these people.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_009.wav|For every year some 2000 come to investors at Buckingham Palace to be honored for acts of bravery or to be recognised for service to their fellow citizens.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_010.wav|They come from all walks of life and they don't blow their own trumpets.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_011.wav|So unless, like me, you are able to read the citations describing what they have done, you couldn't begin to guess at some of the remarkable stories that lie behind their visits to the deprived area or a voluntary worker who has given nearly 40 years of his life to campaigning for the disabled or a nurse whose care for patients for over 30 years is a splendid example of the work done by members of a dedicated profession or another volunteer who has devoted a large part of her life to others in the service of the WRVS.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_012.wav|Then there are those who have shown quite remarkable courage and aversion to duty.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_013.wav|Only a few days ago I was talking to two farming who had been called to deal with a blazing ship.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_014.wav|They knew the work casualties below decks and despite the fact that both men were injured themselves, they risked the flames and smoke and further explosions and went below several times to bring the casualties to safety.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_015.wav|These are not exceptional cases.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_016.wav|Every investor brings stories of bravery and self-sacrifice, like the members of disposal teams whose cool courage saves so many lives.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_017.wav|Naturally I see more such people in Britain but as I often hold investors in other commonwealth countries I know that there are people making the same sort of good news all over the world.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_018.wav|But while bravery and service to the community are recognized by honours and awards, there are many ways in which people can make good news.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_019.wav|Success in industry and commerce, for instance, creates the wealth that provides so many of the things that make life happier and more comfortable.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_020.wav|It's not just the big companies with household names, quite small companies, but only a few members can make a very significant contribution to the prosperity of their communities.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_021.wav|The people in Britain who have helped their companies to success also come to the palace as winners of the Queen's Awards for export and technology.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_022.wav|For example last year there was a firm with only five employees who make darts and export them to no less than 40 countries.|17|59

wavs/queen_1985_030.wav|Christmas is a time of good news.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_031.wav|I believe it is a time to look at the good things of life and to remember that there are a great many people trying to make the world a better place even though their efforts may go unrecognised.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_032.wav|There's a lesson in this for us all and we should never forget our obligation to make our own individual contributions however small towards the sum of human goodness.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_033.wav|The story of the good Samaritan reminds us of our duty to our neighbour.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_034.wav|We should try to follow Christ's clear instruction at the end of that story.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_035.wav|Go and do that likewise and we should never forget our obligation to make our own individual contributions however small towards the sum of human goodness.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_036.wav|The story of the good Samaritan reminds us of our duty to our neighbour.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_037.wav|We should try to follow Christ's clear instruction at the end of that story.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_038.wav|Go and do that likewise.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_039.wav|All this year we seem to have had nothing but bad news with a constant stream of reports of pain crashes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and famine.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_040.wav|And as if natural disasters were not enough we hear of rats, wars, acts of terrorism and generally of man's inhumanity to man.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_041.wav|It used to be said that no news is good news but today you might well think that good news is no news.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_042.wav|Yet there is a lot of good news and some wonderful things are going on in spite of the frightening headlines.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_043.wav|Just think of the quiet courage and dedication of the peacekeepers and the rescue workers and all those who work so hard to restore shattered lives and disrupted communities.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_044.wav|I'm in the fortunate position of being able to meet many of these people.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_045.wav|For every year some 2000 come to investors but backing in palace to be honored for acts of bravery or to be recognised for service to their fellow citizens.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_046.wav|They come from all walks of life and they don't blow their own trumpets.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_047.wav|So unless like me you are able to read the citations describing what they have done you couldn't begin to guess that some of the remarkable stories that lie behind their visits to the palace.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_048.wav|Among them there may be a rarely outstanding doctor who has worked for years in a deprived area or a voluntary worker who has given nearly 40 years of his life to campaigning for the disabled.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_049.wav|Or a nurse whose care for patients for over 30 years is a splendid example of the work done by members of a dedicated profession or another volunteer who has devoted a large part of her life to others in the service of the WRVS.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_050.wav|Then there are those who have shown quite remarkable courage and devotion to duty.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_051.wav|Only a few days ago I was talking to two famine who had been called to deal with a blazing ship.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_052.wav|They knew the were casualties below decks and despite the fact that both men were injured themselves they risked the flames and smoke and further explosions and went below several times to bring the casualties to safety.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_053.wav|These are not exceptional cases.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_054.wav|Every investor brings stories of bravery and self-sacrifice like the members of bomb disposal teams whose cool courage saves so many lives.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_055.wav|Naturally I see more such people in Britain but as I often hold investors in other commonwealth countries I know that there are people making the same sort of good news all over the world but while bravery and service to the community are recognized by honors and awards there are many ways in which people can make good news.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_056.wav|Success in industry and commerce for instance creates the wealth that provides so many of the things that make life happier and more comfortable.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_057.wav|It's not just the big companies with household names, quite small companies but only a few members can make a very significant contribution to the prosperity of their communities.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_058.wav|The people in Britain who have helped their companies to success also come to the palace as winners of the Queen's Awards for export and technology.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_059.wav|For example last year there was a firm with only five employees who make darts and export them to no less than 40 countries.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_060.wav|They were so enterprising that they introduced the game of darts into places where it had never been played.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_061.wav|Then there were the consulting engineers who won their award for technological achievement for their engineers work on the Thames flood barrier.|17|59

wavs/queen_1985_070.wav|The story of the good Samaritan reminds us of our duty to our neighbour.|17|59
wavs/queen_1985_071.wav|We should try to follow Christ's clear instruction at the end of that story.|17|59

wavs/queen_1985_073.wav|I wish you all a very happy Christmas and I hope that we shall all try to make some good news in the coming year.|17|59
wavs/queen_1996_001.wav|to look back is not necessarily to be nostalgic.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_002.wav|When I come to Sandringham each year, I like to reflect on what Christmas must have been like when King Edward VII, my great grandfather and Queen Alexandra first came here as young parents.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_003.wav|I remember my own childhood Christmases here with my father and mother and a great family gathering.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_004.wav|And now I delight in seeing my children and grandchildren enjoying the same traditions.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_005.wav|Christmas is the celebration of the birth of the founder of the Christian faith, an event which took place almost 2000 years ago.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_006.wav|Every year at this time, we are asked to look back at that extraordinary story and remind ourselves of the message which inspired Christ's followers then and which is just as relevant today.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_007.wav|At Christmas, I enjoy looking back on some of the events of the year.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_008.wav|Many have their roots in history, but still have a real point for us today.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_009.wav|I recall especially a dazzling spring day in Norwich when I attended the Moondis service, the Cathedral providing a spectacular setting.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_010.wav|The lovely service is always a reminder of Christ's words to his disciples.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_011.wav|Love one another as I have loved you.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_012.wav|It sounds so simple yet it proves so hard to obey.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_013.wav|In June came troopsing the colour, a vivid reminder of this country's proud military tradition and of the discipline and dedication which our service men and women show in their taxing tasks of peacekeeping in many distant parts of the world.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_014.wav|Then in October I opened Parliament.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_015.wav|This is not just a state occasion, but is also symbolic of the process of parliamentary democracy which we enjoy here in Britain and in so many countries of the Commonwealth.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_016.wav|It is a process which seeks to express the ideal of the equality of all citizens under the law.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_017.wav|So the past with its traditions has its lessons for us in 1996.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_018.wav|And in this year in our travels, Prince Philip and I have also been looking to the future.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_019.wav|I and all my family have always felt that one of our most important duties is to express in our visits overseas the good will of our country towards friends abroad near and far.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_020.wav|So last spring we visited Poland and the Czech Republic where we saw the development of democracy and prosperity in countries which only recently were communist governed.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_021.wav|And everywhere we received the best of welcomes.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_022.wav|In the autumn we went to Thailand where we renewed old friendships and witnessed the blending of tradition with the dynamic commercial spirit.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_023.wav|There was also a happy visit to this country by the president of France.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_024.wav|And I shall never forget the state visit of President Mandela.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_025.wav|That most gracious of men has shown us all how to accept the facts of the past without bitterness, how to see new opportunities as more important than old disputes and how to look forward with courage and optimism.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_026.wav|His example is a continuing inspiration to the whole commonwealth and to all those everywhere who work for peace and reconciliation.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_027.wav|Each year brings its share of difficulties for many families.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_028.wav|This year has I know been no exception and during it some have suffered bereavement of a tragic and shocking kind.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_029.wav|At such times it is tempting for all of us, especially those who suffer.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_030.wav|To look back and say if only.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_031.wav|But to look back in that way is to look down a blind alley.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_032.wav|Better look forward and say if only.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_033.wav|If only we can live up to the example of the child who was born at Christmas with a love that came to embrace the whole world.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_034.wav|If only we can let him recapture for us that time when we face the future with childhood's unbounded faith.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_035.wav|Armed with that faith the new year with all its challenges and chances should hold no terrors for us and we should be able to embark upon it undaunted.|17|70
wavs/queen_1996_036.wav|My family joins me in wishing each one of you a very happy Christmas.|17|70
wavs/queen_1955_001.wav|no doubt you have been listening as I have to the messages which have been reaching us from all over the world.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_002.wav|I always feel that just for these few minutes the march of history stops while we listen to each other and think of each other on Christmas Day.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_003.wav|For my husband and myself and for our children, the year that is passing has added to our store of happy memories.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_004.wav|We have spent most of it in this country and we have enjoyed seeing many parts of the British Isles which we had not visited before.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_005.wav|Now a new year will soon be upon us and we are looking forward to seeing something of Nigeria that great country in equatorial Africa where more than 30 millions of my people have their homes.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_006.wav|For them and for all of us each new year is an adventure into the unknown.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_007.wav|Year by year new secrets of nature are being revealed to us by science.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_008.wav|Secrets of immense power for good or evil according to their use.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_009.wav|These discoveries resolve some of our problems but they make others deeper and more immediate.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_010.wav|A hundred years ago our knowledge of the banks have been filled in.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_011.wav|Our new explorations are into new territories of scientific knowledge and into the unknown regions of human behaviour.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_012.wav|We have still to solve the problem of living peacefully together as peoples and as nations.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_013.wav|We shall need the faith and determination of our forebears when they crossed uncharted seas into the hidden interiors of Africa and Australia to guide us on our journeys into the undiscovered realms of the human spirit.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_014.wav|In the words of our poet laureate, there you have conquered earth and charted sea and planned the courses of all stars that be adventure on more wonders are in thee.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_015.wav|Adventure on, for from the littlest clue has come whatever worth man ever knew.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_016.wav|The next to lighten all men may be you.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_017.wav|We must adventure on if we are to make the world a better place.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_018.wav|All my peoples of the Commonwealth and Empire have their part to play in this voyage of discovery.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_019.wav|We travel all together just as the Maori tribes sailed all together into the mysterious South Pacific to find New Zealand.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_020.wav|There are certain spiritual values which inspire all of us.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_021.wav|We try to express them in our devotion to freedom which means respect for the individual and equality before the law.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_022.wav|Parliamentary government is also a part of this heritage.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_023.wav|We believe in the world.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_024.wav|All these things are part of the natural life of our free Commonwealth.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_025.wav|Great opportunities lie before us.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_026.wav|Indeed a large part of the world looks to the Commonwealth for a lead.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_027.wav|We have already gone far towards discovering for ourselves, had different nations from north and south, from east and west, can live together in a friendly brotherhood, pooling the resources of each for the benefit of all.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_028.wav|Every one of us can also help in this great adventure.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_029.wav|For just as the Commonwealth is made up of different nations, so those nations are made up of individuals.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_030.wav|The greater the enterprise, the more important are personal contribution.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_031.wav|The Christmas message to each of us is indivisible.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_032.wav|There can be no peace on earth without goodwill toward men.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_033.wav|Scientists talk of chain reaction of power releasing yet more power.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_034.wav|This principle must be most true when it is applied to the greatest power of all, the power of love.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_035.wav|My grandfather can George V in one of his broadcasts when I was a little girl called upon his peoples in these words.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_036.wav|Let each of you be ready and proud to give to his country the service of his work, his mind and his heart.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_037.wav|That is surely the first step to setting motion, the chain reaction of the powers of light to illuminate the new age ahead of us.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_038.wav|And the second step is this.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_039.wav|To understand with sympathy the point of view of others within our own countries and in the Commonwealth as well as those I've cited.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_040.wav|In this way we can bring our unlimited spiritual resources to bear upon the world.|17|29
wavs/queen_1955_041.wav|As this Christmas passes and time resumes its march, let us resolve that the spirit of Christmas shall stay with us as we journey into the unknown year that lies ahead.|17|29
wavs/queen_1954_001.wav|it is two years since my husband and I spent Christmas with our children and as we do say today, we look back upon a Christmas spent last year in Auckland in hot sunshine 13,000 miles away though this was strange for us, we felt at home there for we were among people who are my own people and whose affectionate greeting I shall remember all my life long.|17|28
wavs/queen_1954_002.wav|They surrounded us with kindness and friendship as did all my people throughout the mighty sweep of our world and settling journey.|17|28
wavs/queen_1954_003.wav|Nevertheless, to all of us, there is nothing quite like the family gathering in familiar surroundings centered on the children whose festival is truly is in the traditional atmosphere of love and happiness that springs from the enjoyment of simple well-tried things.|17|28
wavs/queen_1954_004.wav|When it is night and wind and rain beat upon the window, the family is most conscious of the warmth and peacefulness that surround the pleasant far side.|17|28
wavs/queen_1954_005.wav|So our commonwealth hath becomes more precious than ever before by the contrast between its homeless security and the storm which sometimes seems to be brewing outside in the darkness of uncertainty and doubt that envelops the whole world.|17|28
wavs/queen_1954_006.wav|In the turbulence of this anxious and active world, many people are leading uneventful lonely lives.|17|28
wavs/queen_1954_007.wav|To them, dreariness not disaster is the enemy.|17|28
wavs/queen_1954_008.wav|They seldom realise but on their steadfastness, on their ability to withstand the fatigue of dull repetitive work and on that courage in meeting constant small adversities, dependent great measure, the happiness and prosperity of the community as a whole.|17|28
wavs/queen_1954_009.wav|When we look at the landscape of our life on this earth, there is in the minds of all of us a tendency to admire the peaks and to ignore the fortills in the fertile plain from which they spring.|17|28
wavs/queen_1954_010.wav|We praise and rightly the heroes whose resource and courage shines so brilliantly in moments of crisis.|17|28
wavs/queen_1954_011.wav|We forget sometimes that behind the wearers of the Victoria or George Cross, the stand ranks of unknown unnamed men and women, willing and able if the call came to render valiant service.|17|28
wavs/queen_1954_012.wav|We are amazed by the spectacular discoveries in scientific knowledge which should bring comfort and leisure to millions.|17|28
wavs/queen_1954_013.wav|We do not always reflect that these things also have rested to some extent on the faithful toil and aversion to duty of the great bulk of ordinary citizens.|17|28
wavs/queen_1954_014.wav|The upward course of a nation's history is due in the long run to the signeness of heart of its average men and women.|17|28
wavs/queen_1954_015.wav|And so it is that this Christmas day, I want to send a special message of encouragement and good share to those of you whose lot is cast in dull and unenvied surroundings, to those whose names will never be household words but to whose work and loyalty we owe so much.|17|28
wavs/queen_1954_016.wav|May you be proud to remember as I am myself how much depends on you and that even when your life seems most monotonous what you do is always a rare value and importance to your fellow men.|17|28
wavs/queen_1954_017.wav|I have referred to Christmas as the children's festival, but this lovely day is not only a time for family reunions, for paper decorations, for roast turkey and plum pudding.|17|28
wavs/queen_1954_018.wav|It has before all its origin in the homage we pay to a very special family who lived long ago in a very ordinary home, in a very unimportant village in the uplands of a small Roman province.|17|28
wavs/queen_1954_019.wav|Life in such a place might have been uneventful, but the light kindled in Bethlehem and then streaming from the cottage window in Nazareth has illumined the world for two thousand years.|17|28
wavs/queen_1954_020.wav|It is in the glow of that bright beam that I wish you all a blessed Christmas and a happy new year.|17|28
wavs/queen_1968_001.wav|it is now 21 years since I first broadcast a Christmas message to the Commonwealth.|17|42
wavs/queen_1968_002.wav|Then our two older children were only four and two.|17|42
wavs/queen_1968_003.wav|Now our daughter joins us for Christmas with her husband and we are celebrating the festival this year with the memories of their wedding very much in our minds.|17|42
wavs/queen_1968_004.wav|We are constantly being told that we live in a changing world and that we need to adapt to changing conditions.|17|42
wavs/queen_1968_005.wav|But this is only part of the truth and I'm sure that all parents seeing their children getting married are reminded of the continuity of human life.|17|42
wavs/queen_1968_006.wav|That is why I think that at weddings all friends and relations and even complete strangers can stop worrying for a moment and share in the happiness of the couple who are getting married.|17|42
wavs/queen_1968_007.wav|I'm glad that my daughter's wedding gave such pleasure to so many people, just at a time when the world was facing very serious problems.|17|42
wavs/queen_1968_008.wav|People all over the world watched the wedding on television.|17|42
wavs/queen_1968_009.wav|But there was still many in London on the day and their warmth and enthusiasm ensured it was an occasion my family will never forget.|17|42
wavs/queen_1968_010.wav|Earlier this year, I went to Canada for a different sort of family occasion.|17|42
wavs/queen_1968_011.wav|This was the meeting of Commonwealth heads of government and here I was reminded of the importance of human relationships in world affairs and how membership of the Commonwealth has a subtle influence on the relationships between its leaders.|17|42
wavs/queen_1968_012.wav|I was impressed by the spirit which brought together so many leaders from such different countries and enabled them to discuss constructively matters which concern us all as friends.|17|42
wavs/queen_1968_013.wav|Those of you who are surrounded by friends or of course who are members of a happy family know this makes life much easier.|17|42
wavs/queen_1968_014.wav|Everything, the good and the bad, can be shared.|17|42
wavs/queen_1968_015.wav|But it is too easy for us to forget those who are not so fortunate.|17|42
wavs/queen_1968_016.wav|However, there are many people of all ages who go out to help the old and the lonely, the sick and the handicapped.|17|42
wavs/queen_1968_017.wav|I am sure that in so doing they find the real happiness that comes from serving and thinking of others.|17|42
wavs/queen_1968_018.wav|I believe that Christmas should remind us that the qualities of the human spirit are more important than material gain.|17|42
wavs/queen_1968_019.wav|Christ taught love and charity and that we should show humanity and compassion at all times and in all situations.|17|42
wavs/queen_1968_020.wav|A lack of humanity and compassion can be very destructive.|17|42
wavs/queen_1968_021.wav|How easily this causes divisions within nations and between nations.|17|42
wavs/queen_1968_022.wav|We should remember instead how much we have in common and resolve to give expression to the best of our human qualities, not only at Christmas but right throughout the year.|17|42
wavs/queen_1968_023.wav|In this Christmas spirit, let us greet all our fellow men and join together in this festival of tolerance and companionship.|17|42
wavs/queen_1968_024.wav|I wish you all a very happy Christmas.|17|42
wavs/queen_1983_001.wav|in the year I was born, radio communication was barely out of his infancy.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_002.wav|there was no television, civil aviation had hardly started, and space satellites were still in the realm of science fiction.|17|57

wavs/queen_1983_004.wav|last month I flew back from Delhi to London in a matter of hours.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_005.wav|it took in George the fifth, three months to make the round trip.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_006.wav|in two thirds of that time, Prince Philip and I were able to visit Jamaica, Mexico, the United States and Canada in the winter, followed by Sweden in the summer, and ending up in the autumn with Kenya, Bangladesh, and finally India for the|17|57

wavs/queen_1983_008.wav|heads of government meeting in New Delhi.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_009.wav|travel and communication have entered a completely new dimension.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_010.wav|in Los Angeles I went to see the space shuttle,|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_011.wav|which is playing such an important part in providing more and better|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_012.wav|international telecommunications.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_013.wav|one of the tasks of that space shuttle was to launch an Indian telecommunications and weather satellite.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_014.wav|and last month, I was able to see how this|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_015.wav|operated during our visit to an earth station in New Delhi.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_016.wav|all this astonishing and very rapid development has changed the lives of almost everyone.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_017.wav|leaders and specialists can meet and discuss political and technical problems.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_018.wav|news travels faster and there is more of it.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_019.wav|new opportunities for world trade and commerce have been opened up by this communication revolution.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_020.wav|perhaps more important, modern technology has touched most aspects of life throughout the world.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_021.wav|we saw this in dramatic form in India.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_022.wav|22 years ago, I had seen something of the problems facing this vast country.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_023.wav|but since then, the population has grown from 440 million to over 700 million.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_024.wav|yet India has managed to become one of the 10 or so leading industrial nations in the world and has become self-sufficient in food.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_025.wav|but in spite of all the progress that has been made, the greatest problem in the world today remains the gap between rich and poor countries.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_026.wav|and we shall not begin to close this gap until we hear less about nationalism and more about interdependence.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_027.wav|one of the main aims of the Commonwealth is to make an effective contribution towards redressing the economic balance between nations.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_028.wav|what we want to see is still more modern technology being used by poorer countries to provide employment and to produce primary products and components which will be bought in turn by the richer countries at competitive prices.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_029.wav|I have therefore been heartened by the rail progress that is being made through the Commonwealth countries run aid schemes and these are very important but the key word for the Commonwealth is cooperation.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_030.wav|there is a flow of experts in all directions with Canadians helping in the Caribbean, Indians in Africa, New Zealanders in India, Australians in Papua New Guinea, British in Kenya.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_031.wav|the list is endless, the web of contacts provided by the Commonwealth is an intricate pattern based on self-help and cooperation.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_032.wav|yet in spite of these advances the age-old problems of human communication are still with us.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_033.wav|we have the means of sending and receiving messages.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_034.wav|we can travel to meetings in distant parts of the world.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_035.wav|we can exchange experts.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_036.wav|but we still have difficulty in finding the right messages to send.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_037.wav|we can still ignore the messages we don't like to hear and we can still talk in riddles and listen without trying to comprehend.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_038.wav|perhaps even the more fundamental needs of people.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_039.wav|electronics cannot create comradeship.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_040.wav|computers cannot generate compassion.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_041.wav|satellites cannot transmit tolerance.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_042.wav|a no amount of technology could have engineered the spirit of the Commonwealth that was so evident in Delhi or the frank friendly and understanding communication that such a spirit makes possible.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_043.wav|i hope that Christmas will remind us all that it is not how we communicate but what we communicate with each other that rarely matters.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_044.wav|we in the Commonwealth are fortunate enough to belong to a worldwide comradeship.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_045.wav|let us make the most of it.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_046.wav|let us all resolve to communicate as friends in tolerance and understanding.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_047.wav|only then can we make the message of the angels come true.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_048.wav|peace on earth goodwill towards men.|17|57
wavs/queen_1983_049.wav|i always look forward to being able to talk to everyone at christmas time and at the end of another year i again send you all my warmest greetings|17|57
wavs/queen_1997_001.wav|at the Christian heart of this United Kingdom stands Westminster Abbey and it was right that it provided the setting for two events this year.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_002.wav|One of them almost unbearably said and one for Prince Philip and me tremendously happy.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_003.wav|Joy and sadness are part of all our lives.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_004.wav|Indeed the poet William Blake tells us that joy and woe are woven fine, a clothing for the soul divine, under every grief and pine runs a joy with silken twine.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_005.wav|This interweaving of joy and woe has been very much brought home to me and my family during the last months.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_006.wav|We all felt the shock and sorrow of Diana's death.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_007.wav|Thousands upon thousands of you expressed your grief most poignantly in the wonderful flowers and messages left in tribute to her.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_008.wav|That was a great comfort to all theirs close to her while people all around the world joined us here in Britain for that service in Westminster Abbey.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_009.wav|But Prince Philip and I also knew the joy of our golden wedding.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_010.wav|We were glad to be able to share this joy at Buckingham Palace with many other couples who are celebrating their 50th anniversary this year.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_011.wav|Then on our own anniversary day came a very different service at Westminster Abbey.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_012.wav|This time the silken twine a service of thanksgiving for our 50 happy years together.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_013.wav|After that service we had a chance to meet and chat to so many different people.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_014.wav|I will never forget that day.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_015.wav|Nor a day five years ago when Windsor Castle suffered a terrible fire.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_016.wav|More than a hundred rooms were badly damaged.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_017.wav|But out of the disaster came opportunities for all sorts of people to display their range of skills, their love of history and their faith in the future.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_018.wav|Last month the restoration of the castle was completed and it is shortly to be open again for all to see.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_019.wav|It is a mixture of the original with later additions and alterations and the result of vigorous blend of the old and the new.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_020.wav|And so it has been in the Commonwealth.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_021.wav|Prince Philip and I were touched by the way the Canadian people welcomed us again to Canada.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_022.wav|We were delighted to be invited to Pakistan and India on the 50th anniversary of their independence and to celebrate their achievements since 1947.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_023.wav|The Prince of Wales represented Britain when the people of Hong Kong marked their return to China in spectacular fashion.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_024.wav|Many of you might have felt a twinge of sadness as we in Britain bed them farewell.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_025.wav|But we should be proud of the success of our partnership in Hong Kong and in how peacefully the Old Empire has been laid to rest.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_026.wav|Out of the Old Empire sprang the Commonwealth family of nations that we know today and that too has grown and changed over the years.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_027.wav|In October 51 representatives of Commonwealth governments met in Edinburgh very much in the spirit of a family gathering.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_028.wav|We all enjoy meeting old friends and making new ones but there was also important business to be done.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_029.wav|The world saw that the Commonwealth can make a major contribution to international relations and prosperity.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_030.wav|The meeting also showed that unity and diversity can go hand in hand.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_031.wav|Recent developments at home which have allowed Scotland and Wales greater say in the way they are governed should be seen in that light and as proof that the kingdom can still enjoy all the benefits of remaining united.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_032.wav|Being united that is feeling a unity of purpose is the glue that bonds together the members of a family, a country, a Commonwealth.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_033.wav|Without it the parts are only fragments of a whole.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_034.wav|With it we can be much more than the sum of those fragments.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_035.wav|For most of us this is a happy family day but I'm well aware that there are many of you who are alone, bereaved or suffering.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_036.wav|My heart goes out to you and I pray that we the more fortunate ones can unite to lend a helping hand wherever it is needed and not pass by on the other side.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_037.wav|St Paul spoke of the first Christmas as the kindness of God dawning upon the world.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_038.wav|The world needs that kindness now more than ever.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_039.wav|The kindness and consideration for others that disarms Malleys and allows us to get on with one another with respect and affection.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_040.wav|Christmas reassures us that God is with us today but as I have discovered a fresh for myself this year he is always present in the kindness shown by our neighbours and the love of our friends and family.|17|71
wavs/queen_1997_041.wav|God bless you all and happy Christmas.|17|71
wavs/queen_1995_001.wav|commemoration and anniversaries are very important elements in our national life.|17|69
wavs/queen_1995_002.wav|Last summer we paid tribute 50 years on to all those who took part in the deadly events of the second world war.|17|69
wavs/queen_1995_003.wav|In May we gave thanks for the end of the war in Europe, and then in August for the first time since the end of the war in the far east, we gave a real welcome home to the veterans of Burma and the Pacific.|17|69
wavs/queen_1995_004.wav|It was difficult to know that day who felt the greater pride those of us watching or those on parade.|17|69
wavs/queen_1995_005.wav|It was an unforgettable day for all of us.|17|69
wavs/queen_1995_006.wav|The war demanded immense sacrifices and acts of selfless endurance and bravery, but the final victory gave much of the world 50 years of relative peace.|17|69
wavs/queen_1995_007.wav|All generations since then have had good reason to be grateful to those who gave their service, and in all too many cases their health or their lives, so that the rest of us could enjoy the freedom to get on with our lives in peace.|17|69
wavs/queen_1995_008.wav|The work for peace is never ending, but long last the fighting between the factions in the former Yugoslavia seems to be coming to an end, with life beginning to return to some kind of normality.|17|69
wavs/queen_1995_009.wav|This Christmas thousands of Commonwealth servicemen and women will be far from their families, already playing their part in the international force dedicated to keeping that peace.|17|69
wavs/queen_1995_010.wav|Closer to home, there has been a peace in Northern Ireland for more than a year.|17|69
wavs/queen_1995_011.wav|It is heartily welcomed by all people of Goodwill.|17|69
wavs/queen_1995_012.wav|These are the first fruits of that ceaseless work for peace.|17|69
wavs/queen_1995_013.wav|They could only have been achieved by the quiet and determined efforts of all sorts of different people, some of them famous, many of them unnoticed and unsung by the world at large, but all peacemakers nonetheless.|17|69
wavs/queen_1995_014.wav|It is when the fighting ceases that the work of reconciliation and reconstruction can begin.|17|69
wavs/queen_1995_015.wav|A short time ago I invited a number of workers from volunteer organisations to backing and palace.|17|69
wavs/queen_1995_016.wav|They came from all over the Commonwealth, and they had worked in many countries, from Bosnia to Rwanda, from Chechnya to Cambodia.|17|69
wavs/queen_1995_017.wav|They go quietly about their business, in harrowing and dangerous circumstances, giving help to the suffering and the hungry.|17|69
wavs/queen_1995_018.wav|Like the people who fought and won the last war, they make no claim to be anything out of the ordinary, but their commitment is very far from ordinary, and their contribution is something of which all their compatriots can feel deeply proud.|17|69
wavs/queen_1995_019.wav|It was during my visit to South Africa last March that I witnessed a glowing example of how the inspiration and energy of one person can benefit thousands of others.|17|69
wavs/queen_1995_020.wav|Seven years ago, sister Ethel came to a township outside Port Elizabeth, where she began teaching young children under the shade of a solitary tree.|17|69
wavs/queen_1995_021.wav|Through her hard work and tenacity, she has now built a preschool and a clinic.|17|69
wavs/queen_1995_022.wav|These provide for children and teenagers who have missed out on formal education.|17|69
wavs/queen_1995_023.wav|Soup and bread is distributed to the heads of 500 families from the township each day, and through the gift of a piece of waste ground by the local council, people are being taught to cultivate the land and grow their own vegetables.|17|69
wavs/queen_1995_024.wav|But I suspect that sister Ethel's modest day and sense of humour prevents her from appreciating the full extent of her achievements.|17|69
wavs/queen_1995_025.wav|The traditional Christmas message speaks of peace and goodwill among men.|17|69
wavs/queen_1995_026.wav|It is the volunteers and the sister Ethel's of this world who spread that message, and it is for the rest of us to welcome it.|17|69
wavs/queen_1995_027.wav|Christ said, blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.|17|69
wavs/queen_1995_028.wav|Thanks to the peacemakers, many millions will enjoy a better Christmas this year.|17|69
wavs/queen_1995_029.wav|I hope your Christmas will be a happy one.|17|69
wavs/queen_1995_030.wav|God bless you all.|17|69
wavs/queen_1956_001.wav|once again, messages of Christmas greeting have been exchanged around the world from all parts of the commonwealth and from the remote and lonely spaces of Antarctica words and thoughts taking their inspiration from the birth of a child in Bethlehem long ago have been carried between us upon the invisible wings of 20th century science.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_002.wav|Neither the long and troubled centuries that have passed since that child was born nor the complex scientific developments of our age have done anything to dim the simple joy and bright hope we all feel when we celebrate his birth there.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_003.wav|That joy and hope find their most complete fulfillment within the loving circle of a united family.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_004.wav|You will understand me therefore when I tell you that of all the voices we have heard this afternoon, none has given my children and myself greater joy than that of my husband.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_005.wav|To hear my say, from all the members of the family gathered here today are very best good wishes go out to you and to everyone on board Britannia as you voyage together in the far southern seas.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_006.wav|Happy Christmas from us all.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_007.wav|Of course it is sad for us to be separated on this day and of course we look forward to the moment when we shall again be together.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_008.wav|Yet my husband's absence at this time has made me even more aware than I was before of my own good fortune in being one of a united family.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_009.wav|With that consciousness in mind I would like to send a special message of hope and encouragement to all who are not so blessed or for any reason cannot be with those they love today.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_010.wav|To the sick who cannot be at home, to all who serve that country in foreign lands or whose duty keeps them upon the oceans and to every man or woman who's destiny it is to walk through life alone.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_011.wav|Particularly on this day of the family festival, let us remember those who like the holy family before them have been driven from their homes by war or violence.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_012.wav|We call them refugees.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_013.wav|Let us give them a true refuge.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_014.wav|Let us see that for them and their children the is-room at the inn.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_015.wav|If my husband cannot be at home on Christmas day, I could not wish for a better reason than that he should be traveling in other parts of the commonwealth.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_016.wav|On his journey he has returned to many places that we have already visited together and he has been to others that I have never seen.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_017.wav|On the void back to England he will call at some of the least accessible parts of the world.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_018.wav|Those islands of the South Atlantic separated from us by immense stretches of the ocean yet linked to us with bonds of brotherhood and trust.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_019.wav|One idea above all others has been the main spring of this journey.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_020.wav|It is the wish to foster and advance concord and understanding within the commonwealth.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_021.wav|No purpose comes nearer to my own desires, for I believe that the way in which our commonwealth is developing represents one of the most hopeful and imaginative experiments in international affairs that the world has ever seen.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_022.wav|If as its head I can make an eryl personal contribution towards its progress it must surely be to promote its unity.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_023.wav|We talk of ourselves as a family of nations and perhaps our relations with one another are not so very different from those which exist between members of any family.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_024.wav|We all know that these are not always easy for there is no law within a family which binds its members to think or act or be alike.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_025.wav|And surely it is this very freedom of choice and decision which gives exceptional value to friendship in times of stress and disagreement.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_026.wav|Such friendship is a gift for which we are truly and rightly grateful.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_027.wav|Nonetheless deep and acute differences involving both intellect and emotion are bound to arise between members of a family and also between friend and friend.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_028.wav|And there is neither virtue nor value in pretending that they do not.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_029.wav|In all such differences however, the comes a moment when for the sake of ultimate harmony the healing power of tolerance, comradeship and love must be allowed to play its part.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_030.wav|I speak of a tolerance that is not in difference but is rather a willingness to recognize the possibility of right in others.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_031.wav|Of a comradeship that is not just a sentimental memory of good days past but the certainty that the tried and staunch friends of yesterday are still in truth the same people today.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_032.wav|Of a love that can rise above anger and is ready to forgive.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_033.wav|That each one of us should give this power a chance to do its work is my heartfelt message to you all upon this Christmas day.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_034.wav|I can think of no better resolve to make nor any better day on which to make it.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_035.wav|Let us remember this during our festivities or it is part of the Christmas message Goodwill to ward men.|17|30
wavs/queen_1956_036.wav|I wish you all a happy Christmas and a happy New Year.|17|30
wavs/queen_1994_001.wav|I shall never forget the events in Normandy last June, when the representatives of the wartime allies commemorated the 50th anniversary of the D-Day landings.|17|68
wavs/queen_1994_002.wav|We who were there, and millions of others through television and radio, paid fitting tribute to the courage of those who took part in that epic campaign.|17|68
wavs/queen_1994_003.wav|As Prince Philippineized stood watching the British veterans march past on the beach at Aramash, my own memories of 1944 were stirred, of how it was to wait anxiously for news of friends and relations engaged in that massive and hazardous operation, of the subsequent ebb and flow of the battles in France, and then in Germany itself, and the gradual realisation that the war rarely was at last coming to an end.|17|68
wavs/queen_1994_004.wav|Since those D-Day commemorations, Prince Philippinei have been to Russia.|17|68
wavs/queen_1994_005.wav|While we were in St. Petersburg, we had the opportunity to honour the millions of patriotic Russians who died fighting the common enemy.|17|68
wavs/queen_1994_006.wav|To see British and Russian veterans standing together in memory of the sacrifices of their comrades in arms was a moving experience.|17|68
wavs/queen_1994_007.wav|I never thought it would be possible in my lifetime to join with the Patriarch of Moscow and his congregation in a service in that wonderful cathedral in the heart of the Moscow Kremlin.|17|68
wavs/queen_1994_008.wav|This Christmas, as we pray for peace at home and abroad, not least in Russia itself.|17|68
wavs/queen_1994_009.wav|We can also give thanks that such cathedrals and churches will be full, and that the great bells which greeted us will be ringing out to celebrate our Saviour's birth.|17|68
wavs/queen_1994_010.wav|We are frequently reminded, of course, that violence and hatred are still all too much in evidence.|17|68
wavs/queen_1994_011.wav|We can take some comfort, however, from the fact that more people throughout the world, year by year, have real hope of their children growing up in peace and free from fear.|17|68
wavs/queen_1994_012.wav|Last Christmas, we were witnessing the signs of a new dawn after the long night of bitterness, and this year these signs have become steadily stronger.|17|68
wavs/queen_1994_013.wav|If that new dawn is to be a rail and not a false one, courage, patience and faith will be sorely needed.|17|68
wavs/queen_1994_014.wav|There are same qualities which kept the flame of hope alive in the war-torn countries of Europe and the far east in the dark days of the last war.|17|68
wavs/queen_1994_015.wav|Christ taught us to love our enemies and to do good to them that hate us.|17|68
wavs/queen_1994_016.wav|It is a hard lesson to learn, but this year we have seen shining examples of that generosity of spirit which alone can banish division and prejudice.|17|68
wavs/queen_1994_017.wav|In Northern Ireland, peace is gradually taking root.|17|68
wavs/queen_1994_018.wav|A fully democratic South Africa has been welcomed back into the Commonwealth, and in the Middle East, long-standing enmities are healing.|17|68
wavs/queen_1994_019.wav|What is it that makes people turn from violence and try to bring peace to their community?|17|68
wavs/queen_1994_020.wav|Most of all I believe it is their determination to bring reality to their hopes of a better world for their children.|17|68
wavs/queen_1994_021.wav|The sight of the happy faces of children and young people in Russia, in South Africa, where so much has changed with such extraordinary speed in the last year, and in Northern Ireland, where there is real hope of a permanent end to the bitterness of recent years, should be enough to convince even the most hardhearted that peace is worth striving for.|17|68
wavs/queen_1994_022.wav|Next year we shall commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War.|17|68
