wavs/lockwood_1972_003.wav|We'd started shooting in January and this was in the March.|12|56
wavs/lockwood_1951_001.wav|do you mean cooking?|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_002.wav|I'll be completely useless at both.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_003.wav|Not so hope.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_004.wav|I was drummed out of the brownies in my first fortnight.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_005.wav|I'm afraid I wouldn't make old bones on a desert island.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_006.wav|It would be a short life and a miserable one.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_007.wav|The eaten birthings are.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_008.wav|Oh, it's always been a favourite of mine.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_009.wav|It has grace and rhythm.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_010.wav|It's a lazy sounding tune.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_011.wav|Well, they couldn't be working all that hard or they wouldn't be able to sing.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_012.wav|It always conjures up for me a very pleasant English scene.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_013.wav|Something from my favourite opera, La Traviata.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_014.wav|I'd like to be able to say that I go and see every production of it in London.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_016.wav|But somehow I don't seem to have a chance of seeing it.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_017.wav|Oh, the Prelude to Act One.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_018.wav|This is a forte, or in my case, a reminder of all the romance and drama and beauty that is to follow.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_019.wav|I was always my favourite among his musical plays was King's Repsady.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_020.wav|I remember the first time I went to see it and I went several times.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_021.wav|It was with Peter Graves.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_023.wav|I remember and had an awful rush to get to the theatre in time.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_024.wav|Or neither Peter nor I had had anything to eat and we were both ravenously hungry.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_025.wav|The enchantment of the play made us forget all about it.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_026.wav|In his own special way, Ivan Avello had genius.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_027.wav|He's a tremendous lost oral theatre and can never be replaced.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_028.wav|I'd like to hear on my desert island.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_029.wav|Some day my heart will awake.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_030.wav|Song by Vanessa Lee.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_031.wav|When I hear that I always wish I'd kept up my singing lessons and then perhaps I've owned my to have written one of his musical plays for me.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_032.wav|Not since I was a fairy in Phantomine.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_034.wav|I was 13 years old.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_035.wav|I've danced in one or two pictures and I learned to fly to music and beat a pan.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_036.wav|Perhaps that was the most rewarding experience I've had in my career so far.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_037.wav|Children are a wonderful audience.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_039.wav|I don't think I'm giving away a really great secret when I tell you that Peter flies by means of a wire which is hooked onto a special harness.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_040.wav|When I was standing on a high rostrum in the wings and the man came to hook on the wire.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_041.wav|I realised to my horror I hadn't got my harness on.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_042.wav|All I could do was climb down from the rostrum, creep along the back of the stage and climb up the side of the boat.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_043.wav|I wish you could have seen the faces of the rest of the cast.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_044.wav|If they were, all standing on the boat and looking up in the air to see me fly down.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_045.wav|Well, next I'd like the Vaughn Williams Fantasia on Green Steves.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_046.wav|Oh, because this music is tied up with my favourite period in history.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_048.wav|Another of my ambitions is to make an Elizabethan film.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_049.wav|Well, incidentally I rather believe the melody of Green Steves was composed a little earlier than Queen Elizabeth's day, but it's certainly achieved its popularity then.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_051.wav|Wait, it's sheer coincidence.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_052.wav|Nothing at all to do with any fondness of mine for Boats.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_053.wav|I'm the world-worst sailor.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_054.wav|The part of the scene turns mead P Green.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_056.wav|It's dug his fair banks in Wilkife.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_058.wav|So I've only ever been in one sea picture and I hope I'm never in another.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_059.wav|Well, the film was made in Hollywood and my first scene in the picture plays on a lovely old sailing ship off Catadena Island.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_060.wav|Well, for some hours the director tried to get the prostrate lockwood onto her feet and in a fit state to be photographed.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_061.wav|But when they did get me upright, they took one look at my face and decided the scene had to be fake.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_062.wav|It's nothing to do with the sea that attracts me to this tune.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_063.wav|Perhaps it's because I mostly scots by ancestry.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_064.wav|I've never been to sky, or that's another of my ambitions to press over while I'm on that island.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_065.wav|My next record's a favourite that I share with somebody else.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_066.wav|My daughter, Margaret Julia.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_068.wav|We've lots of grammar firm sessions together.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_069.wav|She started young or a year younger than I did.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_070.wav|Chakowski's Swan Lake Ballet Music.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_071.wav|Toots' enthusiasm for this record dates from her very first visit to the ballet.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_072.wav|I don't think there's very much I can say about my next choice.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_073.wav|I heard it first on the radio and I went out and bought a copy.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_074.wav|And I've been very fond of it ever since.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_075.wav|It's a little Irish song called The Spinning Wheel.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_076.wav|And it's sung by Delia Murphy.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_077.wav|Oh, I saved the end something grandiose and thrilling, the ride of the Belkieris.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_078.wav|This music has the same effect on me as thunderstorms.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_079.wav|It gives me a feeling of fear.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1951_080.wav|Well, I think perhaps the most important thing to me would be, you know, something to keep my mind occupied.|12|35
wavs/lockwood_1980_001.wav|Oh yes, I, I know all about everybody because historical novels, historical biographies are my passion in life.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_002.wav|And, um, so I'm very up on all the royals from dating way back to heaven knows when.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_004.wav|Um, Edward VII's, um, mistresses, you know, everybody knows about all those ladies and the...|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_006.wav|She had three daughters, this is Toria who was named after her grandmama, Queen Victoria, and how she wouldn't let her marry.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_009.wav|So that isn't all that extraordinary, but, uh, she and point of fact, Queen Alexandra didn't want any of her daughters to marry.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_010.wav|She tried to stop Louise and she tried to stop Mord, and she failed there, but she didn't fail with Toria.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_011.wav|And then, um, it's just the last scene that more than 30 years have passed.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_012.wav|Oh, yeah, super costumes, but no room to put them on.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_013.wav|You've ever been backstage at the ambassadors theater.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_014.wav|It's literally two by four, just about as large as the area we are sitting in at this moment.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_015.wav|I'm not counting the walls, just this.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_016.wav|And with all those costumes and a dresser and oneself and trying to, and they're underground, so you don't get any air.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_017.wav|Well, not really.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_018.wav|No, it's a very tiny stage.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_020.wav|So we were thoroughly spoiled, you know, and, um, the dressing rooms themselves were very roomy, and lovely, devanned, lie down on.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_021.wav|There's just nothing, but all the rest on.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_022.wav|Well, that was what I always wanted to be.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_023.wav|I didn't think about being a, um, what they call a legit actress.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_024.wav|I wanted to be a musical comedy, because, um, my mother loved the theater, and she was, um, what they call nowadays a movie buff.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_025.wav|So I went to see all the pictures with her.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_026.wav|She always took me to the pictures.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_028.wav|There was a great big cinema in the Crystal Palace, and one Christmas they were playing Peter Pan.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_030.wav|Oh, yes, I mean, I wanted to marry Jack Buchanan.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_032.wav|My mother couldn't, said that was far too much, so we had to wait till they came to stretch them all, Lewis Shum, or one of those places, and then we used to go and see it.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_033.wav|And, um, I can remember seeing Jack Buchanan, uh, with the little girl called Marjorie Robertson, who became an illegal.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_035.wav|But, uh, the only shows I did before the age of 12 was charity, and, um, from 12 onwards, uh, I was, I did quite a few things.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_039.wav|And, no, she encouraged me, because, um, you know, she enjoyed going to the theatre, and she enjoyed going to the cinema.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_040.wav|Oh, good heavens, my father more than that, about 67.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_043.wav|Oh, don't tell me, well, everything calls to fasten anything out of the ordinary calls to fasten those days, didn't it?|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_044.wav|I mean, we're going back to 1945, and just because we showed a bit of cleavage.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_046.wav|Yes, absolutely fabulous, and I can remember a very funny story.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_047.wav|They said the GI's, they were all flocking in to see it, and they'd all been all this talk about the cleavage, and they all insisted on going into the circle.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_048.wav|Everything's changed, so it's, it's all so extraordinary now, isn't it?|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_049.wav|I mean, um, it's really rather mind boggling when you think what goes, what did people have asked me that question?|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_050.wav|I don't know, I don't know how to answer that question.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_051.wav|I really don't, because I mean, you know, I had such a strict, such a model upbringing, and everything was so totally different.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_052.wav|18 today, 17 or 18 starting my career today.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_054.wav|I might put my foot down and say, no, I'm sorry, I'm not going to take my clothes off or use four letter words.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_055.wav|Uh, well, one they did, I suppose the person who is closest to me is Phyllis Calvert.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_056.wav|We only ever made one film together, and people seem to think we made so many together.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_057.wav|We only did make the man and grey together, and that's another picture that people never forget.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_058.wav|But, um, she and I have always kept in contact.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_059.wav|No, but the others have sort of drifted away.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_060.wav|Well, he's been around recently, yes, and, um, I saw him quite recently at some of the,|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_061.wav|I can't remember what the occasion was, and I, everybody was being presented with something.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_063.wav|And that was my cue to get up, who see, and present him with this thing, and talk about our old days and my old stable companion.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_064.wav|And he was very touched, and the tears came into his eyes and everything.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_065.wav|And we sat together afterwards at supper, and, um, he was remnant.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_066.wav|And he was missing about the old days, and he was saying, how lovely it all was, and the wicked lady and everything, and I said, you've got a very short memory.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_067.wav|And I, as I remember that very, I said, did I really say all those things?|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_068.wav|And I said, yes, you certainly did.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_069.wav|I'm a grandmother of three.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_070.wav|Two boys and a girl.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_071.wav|Yes, I haven't, of course, I haven't seen very much of them lately, because, uh, we were in Birmingham for five weeks, and then there was all this business about opening in London.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_073.wav|She's very happy.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_074.wav|Well, that's on the lap of the gods, nobody ever really knows.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_075.wav|Oh, well, um, we normally sign up a year.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_076.wav|There are some actresses who will only go into a play for three months or six months, but generally it is a year.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_079.wav|But if you think about the laundry list, or something you've forgotten to do in the garden, you're all right.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_080.wav|But, um, if you start thinking, what do I say next, you've had it.|12|64
wavs/lockwood_1980_081.wav|It's absolutely fatal.|12|64
