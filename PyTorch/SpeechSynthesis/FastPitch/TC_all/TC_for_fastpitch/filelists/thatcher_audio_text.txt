wavs/thatcher_1984_12_17_001.wav|I like Mr Gorbachev, we can do business together, we both believe in our own political systems, he firmly believes in his, I firmly believe in mine, we're never going to change one another.
wavs/thatcher_1984_12_17_002.wav|So that is not in doubt, but we have two great interests in common, that we should both do everything we can to see that war never starts again, and therefore we go into the disarmament talks, determined to make them succeed.
wavs/thatcher_1984_12_17_003.wav|And secondly, I think we both believe that there's a more likely to succeed, if we can build up confidence in one another and trust in one another about each other's approach.
wavs/thatcher_1984_09_26_001.wav|this year, as before in our history, we've seen men and women with braid hearts, define violence, scorning intimidation, and defending their rights to uphold our laws.
wavs/thatcher_1984_09_26_002.wav|By their action, we have seen a new birth of leadership in Britain, and that is the most important thing, the most enduring thing that is going to come out of this cold strike.
wavs/thatcher_2006_001.wav|I'm delighted to send you this message to mark the publication of the Prince.
wavs/thatcher_2006_002.wav|The book tells the story of a truly remarkable man, fighter pilot, ambassador, indefatigable traveler, a man of action.
wavs/thatcher_2006_003.wav|His Royal Highness Prince Bander has been at the heart of many of the great world events of the past 30 years.
wavs/thatcher_2006_004.wav|I was always pleased to see him when I was Prime Minister, because he brought me extraordinary insights and bold proposals.
wavs/thatcher_2006_005.wav|I know how much he has contributed to Saudi Arabia's friendship with the United States.
wavs/thatcher_2006_006.wav|We in Britain also have a special affection for him, because of his early training at Royal Air Force Cranwell and his general support for good causes here.
wavs/thatcher_2006_007.wav|It's wonderful to see his contribution to world affairs properly recognized in this excellent book by William Simpson, Isle Luther Prince, a statesman and a friend.
wavs/thatcher_1973_001.wav|I think it's very difficult for them, uh, particularly the one who's at university who has often asked almost to answer for what I am doing and I'm very conscious of this and try to keep them out of anything like that as much as I possibly can.
wavs/thatcher_1973_002.wav|Uh, they bear up to it very well and they just get used to any comments that they're here and they're having to defend me which they do very robustly indeed.
wavs/thatcher_1973_003.wav|Yes, I do Linda.
wavs/thatcher_1973_004.wav|I think we should have more.
wavs/thatcher_1973_005.wav|There are a few of them out of six men and women in total and it's just not quite enough.
wavs/thatcher_1973_006.wav|But you know, uh, whenever I go to political functions, you'll find that women are much more reluctant to ask questions than men and they tend to do all the practical part of politics.
wavs/thatcher_1973_007.wav|They raise money, uh, they get up things like coffee parties, fates, bazaars, uh, they do things for the elderly, etc. but they don't take so much active part in the discussions.
wavs/thatcher_1973_008.wav|Quite a lot of them go into local councils but it stops there.
wavs/thatcher_1973_009.wav|So I would like to see a few more.
wavs/thatcher_1973_010.wav|I think it depends upon who the person is and I don't think it depends on so much whether it's a man, prime minister or a woman prime minister as whether that person at that time and it's very difficult to foresee what may happen many, many years ahead.
wavs/thatcher_1973_011.wav|It's not holy prejudice.
wavs/thatcher_1973_012.wav|Let's be fair.
wavs/thatcher_1973_013.wav|I don't think we have enough women with the same range of experience in politics as men have had and it is important for whoever becomes prime minister that they've had quite a wide range of experience in top political jobs and we haven't yet worked up sufficient women.
wavs/thatcher_1973_014.wav|I wouldn't say that I was guilty of lack of aggression in Israel and in Ceylon.
wavs/thatcher_1973_015.wav|They've got women prime ministers seem to have done quite well with women prime minister so I don't think we've failed as a sex and some women are very argumentative you know and might even win.
wavs/thatcher_1973_016.wav|I don't think that anyone would say that either Barbara Castle or myself lacked debating fire.
wavs/thatcher_1973_017.wav|I think you might be thinking that well it is a very big responsibility and one's often conscious of it but in education it is shared you know.
wavs/thatcher_1973_018.wav|I don't know whether you realize that I have absolutely no control over what is taught in the schools.
wavs/thatcher_1973_019.wav|I can decide or try to decide how many new school buildings we shall have, how many teachers we shall have, where the money shall go but your teachers and governors of your school and local authorities have control over the subjects that are actually taught.
wavs/thatcher_1973_020.wav|So it's very much a shared responsibility.
wavs/thatcher_1973_021.wav|I think you should get one main benefit to take your O levels, your CSEs at 16 and I think some people you know at school thinking well they won't be able to say that now.
wavs/thatcher_1973_022.wav|So I think for the first time, I don't think you could have all one kind of school and really there's no point in putting two buildings, say a mile and a half or two miles apart and saying that's a grammar, that's a secondary modern two miles apart, we'll call them both the comprehensive.
wavs/thatcher_1973_023.wav|They've got to work as one school.
wavs/thatcher_1973_024.wav|Then I think there are sometimes when there's a lot to be said, forgetting a group of young people to who, but perhaps comparatively rarely but there is a place for it and say there should be none other.
wavs/thatcher_1973_025.wav|Because I don't think that would result in giving the best education to every single young person.
wavs/thatcher_1973_026.wav|Well I think ever since I've been at school, all of the pupils in the upper part of the school always have had because they've helped with the administration of the school, they've often helped the staff out and I think it's developed their sense of responsibility a great deal.
wavs/thatcher_1973_027.wav|No, they're not less than the upper stream in the upper forms, in the first and second forms.
wavs/thatcher_1973_028.wav|You've had enough experience to make a decision.
wavs/thatcher_1973_029.wav|I don't like the king to be used very much but I wouldn't take the power to use it under very careful circumstances away from the staff of schools.
wavs/thatcher_1973_030.wav|Place is births at universities and polytechnics.
wavs/thatcher_1973_031.wav|But I do think we also need to spend more on nursery education and getting better buildings in primary schools.
wavs/thatcher_1973_032.wav|And so for the first time we are starting a 10 year program to do that.
wavs/thatcher_1973_033.wav|Well I am putting a lot more money into education without being prime minister.
wavs/thatcher_1973_034.wav|Indeed the cost of education does go up and up and up and over the next 10 years which will be spending half as much again and indeed when if we get inflation it will be much, much more than that.
wavs/thatcher_1973_035.wav|And one of the main reasons is because there are more pupils in schools because you're staying on longer.
wavs/thatcher_1973_036.wav|We're trying to get a bigger proportion of teachers to the pupils and then more of you are wanting to go to college and university.
wavs/thatcher_1973_037.wav|So we are all the time putting more in both at the top end in the schools and with the expansion of nursery education as well.
wavs/thatcher_1973_038.wav|And you're the chaps we're going to have to pay for it.
wavs/thatcher_1973_039.wav|I would not wish to be prime minister today.
wavs/thatcher_1973_040.wav|I have not enough experience for that job.
wavs/thatcher_1973_041.wav|The only four ministerial position I have held is minister of education and science.
wavs/thatcher_1973_042.wav|Before you could even think of being prime minister you would need to have done a good deal more jobs than that.
wavs/thatcher_1959_001.wav|Oh, very much so.
wavs/thatcher_1959_002.wav|I've done a good deal of other speaking, but speaking in the House of Commons is quite different.
wavs/thatcher_1959_003.wav|It's a unique experience.
wavs/thatcher_1959_004.wav|I didn't notice that it rarely is because of the quality of one's audience and the fact that most of them have had more experience at doing precisely what you are doing.
wavs/thatcher_1959_005.wav|Well, I think we'll just try to be a very good back bench of first.
wavs/thatcher_1959_006.wav|Certainly until these two are a little older, I couldn't take on any more political responsibilities.
wavs/thatcher_1959_007.wav|These responsibilities are quite enough.
wavs/thatcher_1959_008.wav|Well, I mainly do the catering here.
wavs/thatcher_1959_009.wav|I like cooking and I do the shopping and always a big batch of cooking at the weekend.
wavs/thatcher_1959_010.wav|And of course, there are the parliamentary recesses which coincide with the school holidays.
wavs/thatcher_1959_011.wav|So I can see quite a good bit of a children and take them out.
wavs/thatcher_1959_012.wav|And at half term, they come up to the House of Commons and have lunch with me.
wavs/thatcher_1960_001.wav|so very much so, I've done a good deal of other speaking, but speaking in the House of Commons is quite different, it's a unique experience.
wavs/thatcher_1960_002.wav|No, I didn't notice that it rarely is because of the quality of one's audience and the fact that most of them have had more experience at doing precisely what you are doing.
wavs/thatcher_1960_003.wav|Well, I think we'll just try to be a very good backbench of first.
wavs/thatcher_1960_004.wav|Certainly until these two are a little older, I couldn't take on any more political responsibilities.
wavs/thatcher_1960_005.wav|These responsibilities are quite enough.
wavs/thatcher_1960_006.wav|Well, I mainly do the catering here.

wavs/thatcher_1989_11_08_001.wav|Iraq's invasion of Kuwait defies every principle for which the United Nations stands.
wavs/thatcher_1989_11_08_002.wav|If we let it succeed, no small country can ever feel safe again.
wavs/thatcher_1989_11_08_003.wav|The law of the jungle would take over from the rule of law.
wavs/thatcher_1989_11_08_004.wav|The United Nations must assert its authority and apply a total economic embargo unless Iraq withdraws without delay.
wavs/thatcher_1989_11_21_001.wav|May I first join the leader of the opposition in congratulating my honorable friend, the member for Eastbourne, in the way in which he moved the loyal address.
wavs/thatcher_1989_11_21_002.wav|I know when we were in opposition which I'm sure we will never be again.
wavs/thatcher_1989_11_21_003.wav|He is well known for having won his seat and retained it against all the odds, looking always after them both of the constituency member and their rights in this house will secure him another return that both the proposer and seconder are distinguished solicitors.
wavs/thatcher_1989_11_21_004.wav|Grows that are faster rate than our European competitors and that that resulted in employment, he admitted to point out that under a Labour government, they actually had to cut the amount spent on motorways.
wavs/thatcher_1989_11_21_005.wav|He admitted to say that the way in which pensions are managed and the pension rights in the European community are very different from here.
wavs/thatcher_1989_11_21_006.wav|He admitted to say that there's a higher proportion of teachers in proportion to pupils than and he admitted to point out that the age alliances which we have increased and that the actual rates of age alliances for war, we those will go up very much more than inflation next April.
wavs/thatcher_1989_11_21_007.wav|At the end of last period of Labour government, you think from what they said that manufacturing output went up during the period of government, it didn't, in the way in which we're implementing the directives for the single market.
wavs/thatcher_1989_11_21_008.wav|By now some 68 single market directives should have been implemented by the end of June.
wavs/thatcher_1989_11_21_009.wav|France had yet to implement nine, Denmark and the Netherlands 12, all others more than 12, with Italy at 33, with no longer afraid of change, but can respond to it with confidence at an unparalleled rate.
wavs/thatcher_1989_11_21_010.wav|Businesses can once again get a good return on investment.
wavs/thatcher_1975_001.wav|some socialists seem to believe that people should be numbers in a state computer.
wavs/thatcher_1975_002.wav|We believe there should be individuals.
wavs/thatcher_1975_003.wav|We're all unequal.
wavs/thatcher_1975_004.wav|No one's saying heavens is quite like anyone else, however much the socialists may pretend otherwise.
wavs/thatcher_1975_005.wav|And we believe that everyone has the right to be unequal, but to us, every human being is equally important.
wavs/thatcher_1988_001.wav|I think when the Vietnamese have left and when we have some hope of getting a truly representative government in Campo chair, yes, I think the British government will be prepared to give aid and that's what I promised when I went to see so many of them in refugee camp.
wavs/thatcher_1988_002.wav|But the first thing you know is to get the Vietnamese out, we hope they will go out but it's going to take a time yet.
wavs/thatcher_1988_003.wav|And then really the next thing is to ensure that Paul Pot doesn't get back into government because they would all fear him.
wavs/thatcher_1988_004.wav|And so Prince Searnook, who is their head of state, was before the Vietnamese invaded, has been working very hard with all the other people, from all the other groups, to try to make a range for a government that would be suitable for everyone.
wavs/thatcher_1988_005.wav|Most people agree that Paul Pot himself could not go back nor his, some of his supporters who have were very active in some of the terrible things that happened.
wavs/thatcher_1988_006.wav|So there's quite an agreement about that.
wavs/thatcher_1988_007.wav|Some of the Cameroos of course are very different and then there's a much, much more reasonable grouping within that.
wavs/thatcher_1988_008.wav|Well that is what I am assured by people who know.
wavs/thatcher_1988_009.wav|So you'll find that the more reasonable ones of Cameroos will have to place some part in the future government but only a minority part.
wavs/thatcher_1988_010.wav|I share your utter horror that these terrible things went on in Camper chair.
wavs/thatcher_1988_011.wav|United Nations couldn't do anything about them.
wavs/thatcher_1988_012.wav|None of us could do anything about them.
wavs/thatcher_1988_013.wav|They were absolutely terrible and of course there are camps of his supporters and the Cameroos would have to be some of the people who took part in the government.
wavs/thatcher_1988_014.wav|You know I went to that refugee camp and we do help a lot both with the running the camps.
wavs/thatcher_1988_015.wav|We give something like 13 million to running that particular camp.
wavs/thatcher_1988_016.wav|A fantastic number of people there.
wavs/thatcher_1988_017.wav|And then when there's a special program for Camper chair, we give some money.
wavs/thatcher_1988_018.wav|And now there's going to be another program, special program for mothers and babies in Camper chair and we're going to give a quarter million pounds to that.
wavs/thatcher_1988_019.wav|So we don't give directly at the moment to the people in Camper through their government because we don't recognize their government.
wavs/thatcher_1988_020.wav|But we give whenever there's a program run by some of the people who we know will make certain the money gets to the people.
wavs/thatcher_1988_021.wav|Thirdly together and these days we work much more closely to the United Nations than we used to.
wavs/thatcher_1988_022.wav|Now the key people, totally the Pol Pot matter, really are the Chinese.
wavs/thatcher_1988_023.wav|Both the Chinese and the Soviet Union wish to see peace brought to Camper chair and will both be prepared to be very helpful and it's certainly the Soviet Unionist.
wavs/thatcher_1988_024.wav|You know, had we had this interview say two years ago, I think I would have been a bit more pessimistic but don't you find there's a new spirit in the world now.
wavs/thatcher_1988_025.wav|It is that it's time to settle some of these very very old problems.
wavs/thatcher_1988_026.wav|I'm delighted.
wavs/thatcher_1988_027.wav|I think it's marvelous what the children do and I think it's marvelous what the blue Peter children have done.
wavs/thatcher_1988_028.wav|You want something a little bit special for the auction.
wavs/thatcher_1988_029.wav|Last time I think I was on a children's program was a bad job.
wavs/thatcher_1988_030.wav|This time they bought out a little koala bear and perhaps someone would like to buy that and you'll let me know how much it raises and thank the children and happy Christmas to everyone.
wavs/thatcher_1990_001.wav|ah, after 11 and a half wonderful years and we're very happy that we leave the United Kingdom in a very, very much better state than when we came here 11 and a half years ago.
wavs/thatcher_1990_002.wav|It's been a tremendous privilege to serve this country as Prime Minister.
wavs/thatcher_1990_003.wav|Wonderful happy years and I'm immensely grateful to the staff who supported me so well and may I also say a word of thanks to all the people who sent so many letters still arriving and to all the flowers.
wavs/thatcher_1990_004.wav|Now it's time for a new chapter to open and I wish John Major all the luck in the world he'll be splendidly served and he has the makings of a great Prime Minister which I'm sure he'll be in very short time.
wavs/thatcher_1990_005.wav|Thank you very much.
wavs/thatcher_1990_006.wav|Goodbye.
wavs/thatcher_1985_001.wav|come to Scotland several times a year and you always make me feel at home.
wavs/thatcher_1985_002.wav|Indeed, just 10 days after I was elected leader of the Conservative Party, I came to Scotland and I shall never forget the warmth of that reception.
wavs/thatcher_1985_003.wav|Overnight I became Maggie.
wavs/thatcher_1985_004.wav|Now I really would like to thank you for your foresight and thoughtfulness for arranging this rally.
wavs/thatcher_1985_005.wav|It's the best and largest birthday party.
wavs/thatcher_1985_006.wav|I sometimes suggested that the Conservative Party needn't worry about its political strength in Scotland because it's power-based south of the border and Scotland is labour territory.
wavs/thatcher_1985_007.wav|Conservative and a unionist party and we seek success in every part of Britain.
wavs/thatcher_1985_008.wav|As disraeli said, we are a national party or nothing and he was referring not only to people in all parts of Great Britain but to people from all walks of life.
wavs/thatcher_1985_009.wav|Scotland ought to be natural, Tory territory.
wavs/thatcher_1985_010.wav|That's the way we want to see it.
wavs/thatcher_1985_011.wav|For sitting round that table last week was the nations which fought each other in that devastating war which ended 40 years ago.
wavs/thatcher_1985_012.wav|Britain fought then to uphold freedom, democracy and Western civilization itself.
wavs/thatcher_1985_013.wav|One of the world's ugliest tyrannies had to be defeated so that we could live in peace and human dignity.
wavs/thatcher_1985_014.wav|It was a war of the common man, our own, Russian, French and American.
wavs/thatcher_1985_015.wav|We all fought, rich and poor, men at the front, women in the factories, fought together in a common cause which transcended all our differences.
wavs/thatcher_1985_016.wav|Here in Britain under the indomitable leadership at number 10 we lived and made history.
wavs/thatcher_1985_017.wav|Some gave their lives, many were at constant risk in London streets, but ancillo in Coventry of Mermansk.
wavs/thatcher_1985_018.wav|The ideas of men like Mitchell, like Sydney Cam, like Watson, Wat and Barnes Wallace changed the course of the war.
wavs/thatcher_1985_019.wav|Each individual, whoever he was or she was, made his own distinctive contribution to the common purpose.
wavs/thatcher_1985_020.wav|Each was a vital part of the whole, each one mattered.
wavs/thatcher_1985_021.wav|And as it was in winning the war, so it is in winning the peace, each one matters.
wavs/thatcher_1985_022.wav|It was a war fought for freedom and justice.
wavs/thatcher_1985_023.wav|It is a peace built on freedom and justice.
wavs/thatcher_1985_024.wav|For freedom belongs not to a collective, not to this or that class.
wavs/thatcher_1985_025.wav|We lost that vision, we looked to the state for too much and to ourselves for too little.
wavs/thatcher_1985_026.wav|And so in 1979 this government set out to redress the balance between the power of the state and that of the citizen in favour of the citizen.
wavs/thatcher_1985_027.wav|Now Mr. President, I have never believed in laissez faire.
wavs/thatcher_1985_028.wav|I believe that justice each of us has an obligation to make the best of his talents.
wavs/thatcher_1985_029.wav|So government has an obligation to create the framework within which those talents can flourish.
wavs/thatcher_1985_030.wav|And central to that task of creating the right framework is the building of a Britain where everyone can become a property owner.
wavs/thatcher_1985_031.wav|Mr. President, the Labour Party can't stand the thought that we want to move to a classless society where everyone counts.
wavs/thatcher_1985_032.wav|Because class is the whole basis of the Socialist Creed and without it they are lost.
wavs/thatcher_1985_033.wav|And they have uttered yawls of rage.
wavs/thatcher_1985_034.wav|They want to direct where the pension funds will be invested, not for your benefit but to further the Socialist planning.
wavs/thatcher_1985_035.wav|And it's Labour who want to go back to their old levels of income tax.
wavs/thatcher_1985_036.wav|Have you forgotten what those were?
wavs/thatcher_1985_037.wav|Let me remind you, under socialism on earnings a top rate of 83 pens in the pound.
wavs/thatcher_1985_038.wav|That was the income tax and on savings a top rate of 98 pens in the pound.
wavs/thatcher_1985_039.wav|What a penalty on success, hardly the way to keep the talent Britain needs.
wavs/thatcher_1985_040.wav|And it was their supporters who used the picket line to try and prevent men and women from going peacefully to their place of work.
wavs/thatcher_1987_001.wav|let me answer that very deeply because I feel very strongly about it.
wavs/thatcher_1987_002.wav|The greatest divisions this nation has ever seen were the conflicts of trade unions towards the end of a labour government, terrible conflicts.
wavs/thatcher_1987_003.wav|That trade movement, then was under the dictator trade union bosses, some of whom are still there.
wavs/thatcher_1987_004.wav|They used their power against their members.
wavs/thatcher_1987_005.wav|They made them come out on strike when they didn't want to.
wavs/thatcher_1987_006.wav|They loved secondary picketing.
wavs/thatcher_1987_007.wav|They went and demonstrated outside companies where there was no dispute whatsoever and sometimes closed them down.
wavs/thatcher_1987_008.wav|They were acting as they were later in the coal strike before my whole trade union laws were through this government.
wavs/thatcher_1987_009.wav|They were out to use their power to hold the nation to ransom, to stop power from getting to the whole of manufacturing industry to damage people's jobs, to stop power from getting to every house in the country, power, heat and light, to every housewife, every child, every school, every pensioner.
wavs/thatcher_1987_010.wav|You want division, you want conflict, you want hatred, there it was, it was that, which thaturism if you call it that.
wavs/thatcher_1987_011.wav|Not by arrogance, but by giving power to the ordinary decent honorable trade union member who didn't go on to go on strike, by giving power to him over the scargals of this world.
wavs/thatcher_1987_012.wav|Now another one, I believe passionately that people have a right by their own efforts to benefit their own families.
wavs/thatcher_1987_013.wav|So we've taken down taxation.
wavs/thatcher_1987_014.wav|It doesn't matter to me who you are to watch your background is.
wavs/thatcher_1987_015.wav|If you want to use your own efforts to work harder, yes I'm with you all the way.
wavs/thatcher_1987_016.wav|Whether it's unskilled effort, whether it's skilled, or so we've taken the income tax down and the third thing.
wavs/thatcher_1987_017.wav|All my predecessors, yes I read this rarely, yes help McMillan,
wavs/thatcher_1987_018.wav|I would say I am right in their tradition.
wavs/thatcher_1987_019.wav|It was disraeli one nation.
wavs/thatcher_1987_020.wav|We've had an increase of home ownership.
wavs/thatcher_1987_021.wav|You went, you asked what I know you called the gut question right.
wavs/thatcher_1987_022.wav|It's gone to the gut, it's gone to the jugular.
wavs/thatcher_1987_023.wav|Let me finish it.
wavs/thatcher_1987_024.wav|More home ownership, far more share ownership, far more savings and building society accounts.
wavs/thatcher_1987_025.wav|This is what is building one nation as every owner becomes a shareholder, as more and more people own their homes.
wavs/thatcher_1987_026.wav|No, we are getting rid of the divisions.
wavs/thatcher_1987_027.wav|We are replacing conflict with cooperation.
wavs/thatcher_1978_001.wav|all that a government can to rebuild a free and prosperous breath, the police, the courts, the judges, and not least the law-abiding majority of citizens, to all those engaged in law enforcement.
wavs/thatcher_1978_002.wav|We pledge not just our moral but our practical support, and as for the lawbreakers, we say this, you will find in the new conservative government a remusless and implacable opponent.
wavs/thatcher_1979_001.wav|the full weight of Labour's mismanagement at the centre, the inflation, the high interest rates, the fiddling of the rate support grant,
wavs/thatcher_1979_002.wav|Dumfries and Galawai said no, Shetland said no, Orkney said no, the borders said no, Taseide said no, Grand Pion said no, there is no sound or honorable basis for the great constitutional change which Labour have proposed.
wavs/thatcher_1979_003.wav|And the final insult would be for this dying government to try to bend our constitution to keep themselves in power for a few more wretched weeks.
wavs/thatcher_1992_001.wav|sound so that the savings put away at the ground suns christening will still buy the same amount of goods when he comes of age?
wavs/thatcher_1992_002.wav|That is what a sound currency means and that we keep government expenditure within the limits of comparatively low taxation so we do not in fact have to borrow too much or take an ever increasing amount of tax away from the people.
wavs/thatcher_1992_003.wav|Human wants are not satisfied by endless political promises.
wavs/thatcher_1992_004.wav|The wealth of nations and remember Adam Smith said the wealth of nations as well as the wealth of individuals, the wealth of nations comes from the boundless energies and enterprise of individuals determined to improve their lot.
wavs/thatcher_1992_005.wav|That is the way that the wealth and the well being of a nation is created.
wavs/thatcher_1992_006.wav|That is where the resources come from to improve our great public services and why we have been able to do so much more about that than the sources were ever able to do before us.
wavs/thatcher_1992_007.wav|Are the strong defense policies including the nuclear deterrent whose possession was bitterly opposed by the kin of socialists?
wavs/thatcher_1992_008.wav|But as always, when large empires which have been held together by force as always when they fragment times are very uncertain.
wavs/thatcher_1992_009.wav|In politics the unexpected happens.
wavs/thatcher_1992_010.wav|We know that from the foreklens.
wavs/thatcher_1992_011.wav|We know that the days Adam was saying went into Kuwait.
wavs/thatcher_1992_012.wav|The Prime Minister and I were both involved in defeating that tyranny.
wavs/thatcher_1992_013.wav|But the important thing is this and it applies to the United States and for us.
wavs/thatcher_1992_014.wav|We didn't hesitate in sending the forces to the Gulf and we were able to know immediately that we had all the right ship, all the right tanks because the sound defense decisions taken eight to ten years beforehand.
wavs/thatcher_1992_015.wav|I hear the press talking about a hang parliament.
wavs/thatcher_1992_016.wav|A hang parliament would hang the future of our country.
wavs/thatcher_1992_017.wav|Strong decisions and Prime Minister may just be able to take strong decisions and show strong leadership because we had a good sound majority behind us.
wavs/thatcher_1992_018.wav|Just look at some countries that have had coalition governments.
wavs/thatcher_1992_019.wav|You may have read about Belgium in the papers in the last few weeks.
wavs/thatcher_1992_020.wav|It took them a hundred days to form a new government.
wavs/thatcher_1992_021.wav|What would have happened if anything vital had come up during that time.
wavs/thatcher_1992_022.wav|Did it help their main decisions?
wavs/thatcher_1992_023.wav|Did it help their deficit to come down?
wavs/thatcher_1992_024.wav|Not a bit of it.
wavs/thatcher_1992_025.wav|They've got one of the worst deficits in Europe.
wavs/thatcher_1992_026.wav|Not surprising with the coalition government.
wavs/thatcher_1992_027.wav|No one has the guts to stand up and say no to public expenditure.
wavs/thatcher_1992_028.wav|This does continue as coalition governments help them to stand up against the tyrant.
wavs/thatcher_1992_029.wav|No one wanted to buy munitions they wouldn't sell them to us.
wavs/thatcher_1992_030.wav|So do not go for coalition ever.
wavs/thatcher_1992_031.wav|We want a strong decisive majority which enables us to continue the where and which we have, which enables Prime Minister Major to continue the strong leadership of which is already demonstrated for the people of this country and overseas.
wavs/thatcher_1992_032.wav|There can be no doubt that a new clear mandate to Prime Minister Major offers the best hope of solving our present problems of continuing the economic advance which the 1980s began and of ensuring that Britain's reputation rides high in the councils of the world.
wavs/thatcher_1992_033.wav|Prime Minister, your leadership is proven.
wavs/thatcher_1992_034.wav|It will be our most earnest endeavor to win that further period in office that we believe you need and we believe our country deserves.
wavs/thatcher_1982_001.wav|Mr. President,
wavs/thatcher_1982_002.wav|I am honored on behalf of her Majesty's government to welcome the distinguished delegates to the 28th annual session of the North Atlantic Assembly.
wavs/thatcher_1982_003.wav|This is the first time that you've met in London since 1974 and I extend warm greetings to you all.
wavs/thatcher_1982_004.wav|Your discussions will have special significance.
wavs/thatcher_1982_005.wav|You meet at a time when the changes in the leadership of the Soviet Union introduce a period of uncertainty.
wavs/thatcher_1982_006.wav|In the months ahead, we shall judge whether Soviet policies and performance present new opportunities for peace or new dangers to stability.
wavs/thatcher_1982_007.wav|We shall work for the new opportunities, but the alliance must be ready to respond whatever the future holds.
wavs/thatcher_1982_008.wav|Our guiding principles will be those to which the parties to the North Atlantic Treaty committed themselves 33 years ago.
wavs/thatcher_1982_009.wav|When that treaty was signed in Washington in 1949, the American Secretary of State Dean Atterson spoke of the unity of belief of spirit and of interest of the community of nations belonging to NATO.
wavs/thatcher_1982_010.wav|Our Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin said, that last democracy is no longer a series of isolated units.
wavs/thatcher_1982_011.wav|It has become a cohesive organism determined to fulfill its great purpose.
wavs/thatcher_1982_012.wav|And that great European Paul Henry Spark, then Prime Minister of Belgium, described the treaty as an act of faith in the destiny of Western civilization.
wavs/thatcher_1982_013.wav|These words and the treaty itself had stood the test of time.
wavs/thatcher_1982_014.wav|The peace has been kept and freedom upheld for more than three decades.
wavs/thatcher_1982_015.wav|And the fundamental principles of the treaty remain our surest protection and guide for the future.
wavs/thatcher_1982_016.wav|The first pledge of the parties to the treaty was to safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilization of their peoples.
wavs/thatcher_1982_017.wav|Founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law.
wavs/thatcher_1982_018.wav|There is no greater cause a none which requires such constant vigilance.
wavs/thatcher_1982_019.wav|Passive defensive freedom will not do.
wavs/thatcher_1982_020.wav|The struggle for human liberty is unremitting and the threat to it ever present.
wavs/thatcher_1982_021.wav|Our commitment to freedom and justice must be equal to the challenge.
wavs/thatcher_1982_022.wav|We have a double duty to protect our own freedom and to maintain a beacon of hope for those men and women everywhere who desire freedom.
wavs/thatcher_1983_001.wav|one of the great debates of our time is about how much of your money should be spent by the state and how much you should keep to spend on your family.
wavs/thatcher_1983_002.wav|Let us never forget this fundamental truth.
wavs/thatcher_1983_003.wav|The state has no source of money other than the money people earn themselves.
wavs/thatcher_1983_004.wav|If the state wishes to spend more, it can do so only by borrowing your savings or by taxing you more and it's no good thinking that someone else will pay.
wavs/thatcher_1983_005.wav|That someone else is you.
wavs/thatcher_1983_006.wav|There is no such thing as public money, there is only taxpayers money.
wavs/thatcher_1983_007.wav|By inventing more and more lavish public expenditure programs, you don't grow richer by ordering another checkbook from the bank and no nation ever grew more prosperous by taxing its citizens beyond their capacity to pay.
wavs/thatcher_1983_008.wav|We have a duty to make sure that every penny piece we raise in taxation is spent wisely and well.
wavs/thatcher_1983_009.wav|For it is our party which is dedicated to good housekeeping.
wavs/thatcher_1983_010.wav|Indeed I wouldn't mind betting that if Mr Gladstone were alive today, he'd be reapplying to join the Conservative protecting the public services.
wavs/thatcher_1983_011.wav|These are our two great tasks and that demands have to be reconciled.
wavs/thatcher_1983_012.wav|Our very pleasant it would be.
wavs/thatcher_1983_013.wav|How very popular to say, spend more on this, expand more on that and of course we all have our favourite causes.
wavs/thatcher_1983_014.wav|I know I do but someone has to add up the figures.
wavs/thatcher_1983_015.wav|Every business has to do it, every housewife has to do it, every government should do it and this one will.
wavs/thatcher_1995_001.wav|well because when I did the 11 and a half years, which I was in Downing Street, you could divide it up very easily along policy lines and of course everything I didn't said was recorded.
wavs/thatcher_1995_002.wav|So there was really a multiplicity of material and really too much, but it was all this one, of course, um, was much much more difficult how to divide the chapters and I could recall a very great deal, but one had to go back and see what records were available, what reports in the local press and so on.
wavs/thatcher_1995_003.wav|No, I have not kept it our way.
wavs/thatcher_1995_004.wav|Oh yes, yes, that's where I, uh, get some talents with dress making form.
wavs/thatcher_1995_005.wav|That's right.
wavs/thatcher_1995_006.wav|And both not only the business, but they saved saving was very much a part of your whole approach in those days.
wavs/thatcher_1995_007.wav|That was your only possibility of starting in life because you wouldn't inherit anything.
wavs/thatcher_1995_008.wav|My father telling me when he came to Grantham, uh, quite a young man as a manager in a local grocery store, he was paid 14 shillings a week and 12 shillings went on his board and lodgings.
wavs/thatcher_1995_009.wav|The next shilling he saved and the next shilling he spent after your bare necessities were met.
wavs/thatcher_1995_010.wav|And this was in wartime.
wavs/thatcher_1995_011.wav|No, this is one of our great customers who really was extremely economical and she also a very good needle woman and she was said to my mother on one occasion, uh, that in wartime everything was scarce and so when she tacked things together she drew out the tackings that's carefully and used them again.
wavs/thatcher_1995_012.wav|And my mother was absolutely amazed and my mother was very economical.
wavs/thatcher_1995_013.wav|Yes, and my mother backed him up a whole way.
wavs/thatcher_1995_014.wav|It really was most marvelous relationship because she was a very good organizer and extremely hard worker.
wavs/thatcher_1995_015.wav|So often, you know, I was questioned how in the world did I manage to do so many things and I said, well, you should have known the life.
wavs/thatcher_1995_016.wav|My mother led.
wavs/thatcher_1995_017.wav|She had a big bake twice a week, but you got up very early on Sunday morning to a big bake as well as to prepare the Sunday meal and also Thursday afternoon was half day our shop was closed on Thursday.
wavs/thatcher_1995_018.wav|It wasn't a half day for my mother.
wavs/thatcher_1995_019.wav|That was when she did her other big bake for the week and around Christmas time my mother and for my grandmother before her.
wavs/thatcher_1995_020.wav|We made enough Christmas puddings so we could have one every week until Easter.
wavs/thatcher_1995_021.wav|So we had a lot of you could go and holiday together because you didn't have enough staff to carry on.
wavs/thatcher_1995_022.wav|One of you always had to be there.
wavs/thatcher_1995_023.wav|We never had a family holiday.
wavs/thatcher_1995_024.wav|And what is more in my young day there was no possibility of my father ever retiring.
wavs/thatcher_1995_025.wav|You would never have had resources to retire.
wavs/thatcher_1995_026.wav|You would just go on working somehow.
wavs/thatcher_1995_027.wav|It was not until the beverage report, it was a result of wartime that there was a basic pension.
wavs/thatcher_1995_028.wav|And you could think of retiring.
wavs/thatcher_1995_029.wav|Life was work.
wavs/thatcher_1995_030.wav|But don't think it was dull.
wavs/thatcher_1995_031.wav|It wasn't work as fascinating.
wavs/thatcher_1995_032.wav|It's interesting sometimes you're tired.
wavs/thatcher_1995_033.wav|But always in when you run a shop.
wavs/thatcher_1995_034.wav|There are always people coming in and out and in some ways your shop particularly with my father, local counsellor, a very, very good debater and a very good speaker.
wavs/thatcher_1995_035.wav|People came in and they bought something and then they stayed for a chat.
wavs/thatcher_1995_036.wav|Don't forget that there were days of great unemployment and unemployment marches.
wavs/thatcher_1995_037.wav|And how are we going to get out of that?
wavs/thatcher_1995_038.wav|And then there were days when we knew something was going on in Germany.
wavs/thatcher_1995_039.wav|When we came in the first day, it looked as if Hitler was organising things and then gradually this terrible dictatorship came out and then he banned Rotary.
wavs/thatcher_1995_040.wav|I can remember my father saying it was a great compliment to Rotary that Hitler banned it.
wavs/thatcher_1995_041.wav|All of a sudden one day my father had a letter from Edith's father after the Anschluss in Austria to say that the Jews were being very badly treated, extremely badly treated.
wavs/thatcher_1995_042.wav|And if he could manage to get Edith out of Vienna, could we take her?
wavs/thatcher_1995_043.wav|It was urgent because people being made to scrub the streets and all sorts of terrible things happening.
wavs/thatcher_1995_044.wav|And my father said, well we can't possibly do this alone.
wavs/thatcher_1995_045.wav|And he took it to Rotary and Rotary agreed to sponsor her and she came over and then eventually well after the beginning of war she went to friends in Brazil where she still is and then discovered her.
wavs/thatcher_1995_046.wav|But I'm always so very grateful that a grocer in a small town, a Rotarian, but a man with a vision for the future and a fundamental knowledge of what was right and wrong.
wavs/thatcher_1995_047.wav|It didn't occur to him that he could refuse but he had to find a way to make it possible.
wavs/thatcher_1995_048.wav|And sometimes when I've been sitting in cabinet and I've heard politicians say, oh the people in the country won't understand that.
wavs/thatcher_1995_049.wav|All my experiences made me say, they will you know, they will.
wavs/thatcher_1995_050.wav|There was a very considerable pacifism which was, you have to remember it was not long since the end of World War One, don't forget World War Two began 21 years after the end of World War One and there are people who thought that you could do everything by pacifism that time.
wavs/thatcher_1995_051.wav|You could just sit round a table and you should talk everything through and therefore there are people who said no, we will not go and fight for our fucking country again.
wavs/thatcher_1995_052.wav|And then everyone should know that we'll have to solve things by peaceful methods and the League of Nations who are dead.
wavs/thatcher_1995_053.wav|Well, evil is always with us and evil people will not be asswaged by good people.
wavs/thatcher_1995_054.wav|You have to defend everything you're believing.
wavs/thatcher_1995_055.wav|So that of course is a justification for war.
wavs/thatcher_1995_056.wav|Certainly not.
wavs/thatcher_1995_057.wav|No, my father was very, very realistic.
wavs/thatcher_1995_058.wav|He knew that you had to deter evil by strengths, by making it quite clear that if people went towards the only way to cherish and further your belief in your religion and your life of freedom was to be prepared to defend it.
wavs/thatcher_1995_059.wav|He of course felt particularly strongly about it.
wavs/thatcher_1995_060.wav|He was not fit.
wavs/thatcher_1995_061.wav|His younger brother had been killed in World War One.
wavs/thatcher_1995_062.wav|He had tried to join up six times, but each and every time being refused.
wavs/thatcher_1995_063.wav|I don't I'm afraid I haven't got a piano and I perhaps one day will take it up again.
wavs/thatcher_1995_064.wav|But I loved it.
wavs/thatcher_1995_065.wav|But the great hymns and of course Charles Wesley's hymns and our tradition in our church where we had a very good choir and a very good organ master and a good conductor.
wavs/thatcher_1995_066.wav|We did one of the great oratorios each year.
wavs/thatcher_1995_067.wav|We couldn't take obviously the main singing parts so we always were able to get someone to come down from London.
wavs/thatcher_1995_068.wav|We paid them obviously.
wavs/thatcher_1995_069.wav|Oh, just marvellous.
wavs/thatcher_1995_070.wav|I remember talking to one of my friends who my knurna-dox was quite high church and who then become agnostic.
wavs/thatcher_1995_071.wav|And he came to see me and he actually was very, very ill and not long to live.
wavs/thatcher_1995_072.wav|And I knew that he had been very keen on music and choral music and I said, look, have you returned to Magnosticism to your earlier faith?
wavs/thatcher_1995_073.wav|And he said no and I thought I'm surprised.
wavs/thatcher_1995_074.wav|But he said sometimes when I listen to the great choruses and audio, it's a great choral music.
wavs/thatcher_1995_075.wav|It's such inspiration that that would be the most likely thing.
wavs/thatcher_1995_076.wav|Yes, indeed.
wavs/thatcher_1995_077.wav|I'd had a cousin who had gone to London.
wavs/thatcher_1995_078.wav|But I was the first officer to go to Oxford but we were very much aware that we were privileged to be there.
wavs/thatcher_1995_079.wav|I was taking a science degree and I went just at 17.
wavs/thatcher_1995_080.wav|I was doing 18 but we could get them three years in before we were called out.
wavs/thatcher_1995_081.wav|But obviously when the landings came, the Normandy landings came, we were very much aware that we were in Oxford and all the dangers that were going on elsewhere.
wavs/thatcher_1995_082.wav|But we had to do some, I was called war work.
wavs/thatcher_1995_083.wav|I used to serve in a canteen in some of the evenings.
wavs/thatcher_1995_084.wav|And it got its hard work but it was interesting.
wavs/thatcher_1995_085.wav|You're constantly then in touch with life as it was at that time.
wavs/thatcher_1995_086.wav|All of a sudden, the 1945 election, the end of the election came and Quinton Hogg was our candidate and I was still at the end of term.
wavs/thatcher_1995_087.wav|I was there for part of the campaign and went conversing in the streets and went round to some of the big election meetings.
wavs/thatcher_1995_088.wav|Quinton was a marvellous orator, the meetings in Yorkshire Town Hall were terrific.
wavs/thatcher_1995_089.wav|So I went round to some of the smaller meetings and of course we were very much conscious that if we didn't win the election, we wouldn't have Winston as our prime minister and he of course had fought so many political battles as well as been the prime minister throughout the war.
wavs/thatcher_1995_090.wav|And I remember saying at one meeting where I was the speaker, until the main speaker arrived, we had to keep going until your candidate arrived.
wavs/thatcher_1995_091.wav|That time, if we didn't win, we shouldn't have Winston Churchill.
wavs/thatcher_1995_092.wav|And I was amazed when someone got up from the orders and very nice man got up and the view point he put was, look why shouldn't we have Mr. Atley?
wavs/thatcher_1995_093.wav|Who has been looking after the country when Winston Churchill has been away?
wavs/thatcher_1995_094.wav|It's been term and atley.
wavs/thatcher_1995_095.wav|And all of a sudden I realised it wasn't going to be a walk over.
wavs/thatcher_1995_096.wav|And there were people who felt very strong knew as a need for change and they had very great faith in Mr. Atley which we all had when we saw how he handled things.
wavs/thatcher_1995_097.wav|And then I went home with the other part and again was going round a totally different campaign in a country seat, Grandtaman's sleaford.
wavs/thatcher_1995_098.wav|And sometimes you would have to go to six meetings in a night as you went from one village to another because the candidate had to appear in every village.
wavs/thatcher_1995_099.wav|And so we opened the thing up for questions.
wavs/thatcher_1995_100.wav|Now I remember again, a white-haired man who would be in a farm worker at the back, saying he thought it was gross down fair that people like him who'd saved very carefully also their life wouldn't get any of the national assistance that others got.
wavs/thatcher_1995_101.wav|And he said just because I've got a little bit of money it's not fair.
wavs/thatcher_1995_102.wav|I saved and I don't get it.
wavs/thatcher_1995_103.wav|And there he'd expressed in a few words with a link and share accent in a few words, the dilemma that is politics, that those who've saved not after themselves being self-reliant don't get anything and those were spent every penny, put themselves on the state, rely upon the conscientious peasant.
wavs/thatcher_1995_104.wav|And I went back to have some supper with some staunch workers and they knew my husband, the new Dennis Hattivey, when he was there.
wavs/thatcher_1995_105.wav|Things that you could never forecast.
wavs/thatcher_1995_106.wav|Things that appeared to be by chance.
wavs/thatcher_1995_107.wav|I mean, it was extraordinary strange and I forgot about it for years.
wavs/thatcher_1995_108.wav|And a rather nice lady said, can I feel your pearls just just take them off and I took the necklace off and she felt them in her hands for a little time.
wavs/thatcher_1995_109.wav|Oh, she said, this is interesting.
wavs/thatcher_1995_110.wav|She said, you will be great like Winston Churchill.
wavs/thatcher_1995_111.wav|I said, oh that's absolutely absurd.
wavs/thatcher_1995_112.wav|Are you all being great?
wavs/thatcher_1995_113.wav|And eventually I left the tent, I thought no more of it after all it was a fortune teller.
wavs/thatcher_1995_114.wav|I think I wore the pearls a little bit more regularly.
wavs/thatcher_1995_115.wav|Yes, after I, this is after I'd come later the party.
wavs/thatcher_1995_116.wav|I knew that you had to get to a breathing right for singing and this lady really got my breathing right and I thought to make my voice lower, I would move it further back, I would speak from the back of the throat that soon very gives it.
wavs/thatcher_1995_117.wav|And this remarkable lady made me breathe as an opera singer, well, breathed from the diaphragm and pushed it to the, your breath through to the front of your mouth and speak from the front of the sound, speaking now.
wavs/thatcher_1995_118.wav|And then it, your voice comes all right.
wavs/thatcher_1995_119.wav|She was a fascinating lady.
wavs/thatcher_1995_120.wav|A character, I was speaking my own lines and therefore I knew what message I wanted to get across.
wavs/thatcher_1995_121.wav|It might not have been the most perfect English but I had to see whether it was going across and sometimes you're speaking from a stage and they put all of the floodlights on you.
wavs/thatcher_1995_122.wav|I say, look, I can't stand that.
wavs/thatcher_1995_123.wav|Please take those floodlights down.
wavs/thatcher_1995_124.wav|I must see the audience.
wavs/thatcher_1995_125.wav|I must be able to look around and see if the message is getting across and then I was told, but an actor, if he looked up and saw the audience, he would forget his lines.
wavs/thatcher_1995_126.wav|It would throw him.
wavs/thatcher_1995_127.wav|Yes.
wavs/thatcher_1995_128.wav|Isn't it interesting?
wavs/thatcher_1995_129.wav|Yes.
wavs/thatcher_1995_130.wav|But last time I lived, it was very good and very kind because by that time I thought I got my voice wrapped, I just wanted to know and he'd been looking and it's interesting.
wavs/thatcher_1995_131.wav|He picked up the point.
wavs/thatcher_1995_132.wav|He said, you're gazed to the audience.
wavs/thatcher_1995_133.wav|It's really quite good.

wavs/thatcher_1995_138.wav|We're different.
wavs/thatcher_1995_139.wav|We should always be different.
wavs/thatcher_1995_140.wav|This is our history.
wavs/thatcher_1995_141.wav|This is because we weren't born in the heart of Europe, born in offshore island.
wavs/thatcher_1995_142.wav|We built up a great colonial empire and then a great commonwealth.
wavs/thatcher_1995_143.wav|These talents that are British that's alone in Europe stood out against Hitler.
wavs/thatcher_1995_144.wav|These talents are there to be encouraged, to be re-vivified, to be renewed and still to play their part in the world of the future.
wavs/thatcher_1995_145.wav|Which will be saved not by European Union, but by the great Anglo-American Alliance, which has always come to the rescue of liberty under the rule of law, that liberty may never perish from the earth.
wavs/thatcher_1980_001.wav|if I could press a button and genuinely solve the unemployment problem, do you think that I would not press that button this instant?
wavs/thatcher_1980_002.wav|does anyone imagine that there is the smallest political gain in letting this level of unemployment continue?
wavs/thatcher_1980_003.wav|or that there is some obscure economic religion which demands this level of unemployment as part of its grizzly ritual?
wavs/thatcher_1980_004.wav|Mr. Chairman, this government is pursuing the only policy which gives any hope of bringing our people back to real and lasting employment.
wavs/thatcher_2009_001.wav|your university does make great honor with this award and i am only sorry that i cannot be with you in person to receive it.
wavs/thatcher_2009_002.wav|since medieval times, Poland has been famous for the outstanding quality of the scholarship which strived in its historic universities.
wavs/thatcher_2009_003.wav|they began as communities of learning.
wavs/thatcher_2009_004.wav|they prospered under inspiring teachers.
wavs/thatcher_2009_005.wav|they attracted young people eager for knowledge.
wavs/thatcher_2009_006.wav|the scholarship which made them renowned still flourishes and brings with it renewed opportunities.
wavs/thatcher_2009_007.wav|today, new centres of learning complement the old.
wavs/thatcher_2009_008.wav|new subjects add to the traditional and new generations are developing the skills which will take Poland forward to a bright and prosperous future.
wavs/thatcher_2009_009.wav|and that is the future the people of Poland deserve.

wavs/thatcher_2009_012.wav|during those dark years, Poland experienced oppression and atrocity but you never ceased to have hope.
wavs/thatcher_2009_013.wav|nor did liberation bring with it the relief for which your people craved.
wavs/thatcher_2009_014.wav|it would be another four and a half decades before your epic struggle for freedom was to achieve success.
wavs/thatcher_2009_015.wav|the bleakness and despair of all those years might have overwhelmed less nations.
wavs/thatcher_2009_016.wav|but a spirit of the poorest people drawing on a noble and heroic history could not be broken.
wavs/thatcher_2009_017.wav|Britain's of my generation will remember those courageous pose who escaped and helped to defend our shores.
wavs/thatcher_2009_018.wav|it is partly why the poorest people have a very special place in our affection.
wavs/thatcher_2009_019.wav|and it was that very same undaunted spirit I witnessed when I made my momentous visit to the Gdansk Sipia in November 1988.
wavs/thatcher_2009_020.wav|I knew then as I surveyed the masses of cheering people that communism had reached its end.
wavs/thatcher_2009_021.wav|Poland would soon be free.
wavs/thatcher_2009_022.wav|Freedom is not always an easy part to follow.
wavs/thatcher_2009_023.wav|there are setbacks but freedom allows our hopes to soar above all the disappointments.
wavs/thatcher_2009_024.wav|it inspires us to create a better future, one greater than we could have imagined in our younger days.
wavs/thatcher_2009_025.wav|so that is our challenge.
