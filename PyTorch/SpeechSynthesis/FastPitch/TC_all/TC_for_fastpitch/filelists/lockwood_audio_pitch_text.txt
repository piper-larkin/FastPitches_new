mels/lockwood_1972_002.pt|pitch/lockwood_1972_002.pt|I should think somewhere in the region of 25 to 30 youngsters and everybody was longing to get the part, we'd all read the book, we all knew what it was about and uh, we knew of course that shevalier was going to be the star and there was an older woman in the, in the film, which was a, uh, finally played by Betty Stockfield because it was done in two versions English and French and Betty Stockfield could be in both versions because she spoke fluent French and of course I was absolutely overjoyed and overwhelmed when I got the part but what I remember very vividly about it is that uh, we were going to Nisse which I was terribly excited about because I'd never been to South France.
mels/lockwood_1972_003.pt|pitch/lockwood_1972_003.pt|We'd started shooting in January and this was in the March.
mels/lockwood_1972_004.pt|pitch/lockwood_1972_004.pt|So we all plotted off to the South of France and we arrived in the point, really just to say and we were all put up at the Nagrasco which was my first experience at a super luxury hotel.
mels/lockwood_1972_005.pt|pitch/lockwood_1972_005.pt|When we first arrived there was what was known as a tea dance going on which was a very popular thing in those days and we all went down to watch the tea dance and we were sitting at this table and uh, shevalier was there and all the others at the cast and uh, he got up to dance with them some completely unknown woman.
mels/lockwood_1972_006.pt|pitch/lockwood_1972_006.pt|I don't know who she was but I think he'd rather fancy that it was the, and he got up to dance with her and we were watching them and I was sitting there with my mouth open because he was nibbling her ear and I said to somebody does, does Mr. Shevalier know her?
mels/lockwood_1951_001.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_001.pt|do you mean cooking?
mels/lockwood_1951_002.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_002.pt|I'll be completely useless at both.
mels/lockwood_1951_003.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_003.pt|Not so hope.
mels/lockwood_1951_004.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_004.pt|I was drummed out of the brownies in my first fortnight.
mels/lockwood_1951_005.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_005.pt|I'm afraid I wouldn't make old bones on a desert island.
mels/lockwood_1951_006.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_006.pt|It would be a short life and a miserable one.
mels/lockwood_1951_007.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_007.pt|The eaten birthings are.
mels/lockwood_1951_008.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_008.pt|Oh, it's always been a favourite of mine.
mels/lockwood_1951_009.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_009.pt|It has grace and rhythm.
mels/lockwood_1951_010.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_010.pt|It's a lazy sounding tune.
mels/lockwood_1951_011.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_011.pt|Well, they couldn't be working all that hard or they wouldn't be able to sing.
mels/lockwood_1951_012.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_012.pt|It always conjures up for me a very pleasant English scene.
mels/lockwood_1951_013.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_013.pt|Something from my favourite opera, La Traviata.
mels/lockwood_1951_014.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_014.pt|I'd like to be able to say that I go and see every production of it in London.
mels/lockwood_1951_015.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_015.pt|I'd like to.
mels/lockwood_1951_016.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_016.pt|But somehow I don't seem to have a chance of seeing it.
mels/lockwood_1951_017.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_017.pt|Oh, the Prelude to Act One.
mels/lockwood_1951_018.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_018.pt|This is a forte, or in my case, a reminder of all the romance and drama and beauty that is to follow.
mels/lockwood_1951_019.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_019.pt|I was always my favourite among his musical plays was King's Repsady.
mels/lockwood_1951_020.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_020.pt|I remember the first time I went to see it and I went several times.
mels/lockwood_1951_021.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_021.pt|It was with Peter Graves.
mels/lockwood_1951_022.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_022.pt|I was filming.
mels/lockwood_1951_023.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_023.pt|I remember and had an awful rush to get to the theatre in time.
mels/lockwood_1951_024.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_024.pt|Or neither Peter nor I had had anything to eat and we were both ravenously hungry.
mels/lockwood_1951_025.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_025.pt|The enchantment of the play made us forget all about it.

mels/lockwood_1951_032.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_032.pt|Not since I was a fairy in Phantomine.
mels/lockwood_1951_033.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_033.pt|I've been a very first job.
mels/lockwood_1951_034.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_034.pt|I was 13 years old.
mels/lockwood_1951_035.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_035.pt|I've danced in one or two pictures and I learned to fly to music and beat a pan.
mels/lockwood_1951_036.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_036.pt|Perhaps that was the most rewarding experience I've had in my career so far.

mels/lockwood_1951_038.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_038.pt|Oh, I loved it.
mels/lockwood_1951_039.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_039.pt|I don't think I'm giving away a really great secret when I tell you that Peter flies by means of a wire which is hooked onto a special harness.
mels/lockwood_1951_040.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_040.pt|When I was standing on a high rostrum in the wings and the man came to hook on the wire.
mels/lockwood_1951_041.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_041.pt|I realised to my horror I hadn't got my harness on.
mels/lockwood_1951_042.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_042.pt|All I could do was climb down from the rostrum, creep along the back of the stage and climb up the side of the boat.
mels/lockwood_1951_043.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_043.pt|I wish you could have seen the faces of the rest of the cast.
mels/lockwood_1951_044.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_044.pt|If they were, all standing on the boat and looking up in the air to see me fly down.
mels/lockwood_1951_045.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_045.pt|Well, next I'd like the Vaughn Williams Fantasia on Green Steves.
mels/lockwood_1951_046.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_046.pt|Oh, because this music is tied up with my favourite period in history.
mels/lockwood_1951_047.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_047.pt|The Elizabethan.
mels/lockwood_1951_048.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_048.pt|Another of my ambitions is to make an Elizabethan film.
mels/lockwood_1951_049.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_049.pt|Well, incidentally I rather believe the melody of Green Steves was composed a little earlier than Queen Elizabeth's day, but it's certainly achieved its popularity then.

mels/lockwood_1951_051.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_051.pt|Wait, it's sheer coincidence.
mels/lockwood_1951_052.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_052.pt|Nothing at all to do with any fondness of mine for Boats.
mels/lockwood_1951_053.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_053.pt|I'm the world-worst sailor.
mels/lockwood_1951_054.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_054.pt|The part of the scene turns mead P Green.

mels/lockwood_1951_058.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_058.pt|So I've only ever been in one sea picture and I hope I'm never in another.
mels/lockwood_1951_059.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_059.pt|Well, the film was made in Hollywood and my first scene in the picture plays on a lovely old sailing ship off Catadena Island.
mels/lockwood_1951_060.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_060.pt|Well, for some hours the director tried to get the prostrate lockwood onto her feet and in a fit state to be photographed.
mels/lockwood_1951_061.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_061.pt|But when they did get me upright, they took one look at my face and decided the scene had to be fake.
mels/lockwood_1951_062.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_062.pt|It's nothing to do with the sea that attracts me to this tune.
mels/lockwood_1951_063.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_063.pt|Perhaps it's because I mostly scots by ancestry.

mels/lockwood_1951_073.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_073.pt|I heard it first on the radio and I went out and bought a copy.
mels/lockwood_1951_074.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_074.pt|And I've been very fond of it ever since.
mels/lockwood_1951_075.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_075.pt|It's a little Irish song called The Spinning Wheel.
mels/lockwood_1951_076.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_076.pt|And it's sung by Delia Murphy.
mels/lockwood_1951_077.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_077.pt|Oh, I saved the end something grandiose and thrilling, the ride of the Belkieris.
mels/lockwood_1951_078.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_078.pt|This music has the same effect on me as thunderstorms.
mels/lockwood_1951_079.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_079.pt|It gives me a feeling of fear.
mels/lockwood_1951_080.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_080.pt|Well, I think perhaps the most important thing to me would be, you know, something to keep my mind occupied.

mels/lockwood_1951_082.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_082.pt|No, no answers.
mels/lockwood_1951_083.pt|pitch/lockwood_1951_083.pt|Goodbye.
mels/lockwood_1980_001.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_001.pt|Oh yes, I, I know all about everybody because historical novels, historical biographies are my passion in life.
mels/lockwood_1980_002.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_002.pt|And, um, so I'm very up on all the royals from dating way back to heaven knows when.
mels/lockwood_1980_003.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_003.pt|Well, the author has taken, I don't know how much, um, dramatic license with the character because, uh, she really is generally known as having been a very beautiful woman and a very glamorous woman who had was married to a man who was very unfaithful to her.
mels/lockwood_1980_004.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_004.pt|Um, Edward VII's, um, mistresses, you know, everybody knows about all those ladies and the...
mels/lockwood_1980_005.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_005.pt|Plus the other scandals, he was involved in some gambling scandal two at one time and, uh, anyway, Royce Wright has taken a certain, um, probably a liberty with the fact that, uh, well, the story is really about the relationship between the mother and the daughter.
mels/lockwood_1980_006.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_006.pt|She had three daughters, this is Toria who was named after her grandmama, Queen Victoria, and how she wouldn't let her marry.
mels/lockwood_1980_007.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_007.pt|And, uh, she plays her final card at the very end of the play and, uh, it's, it's really a rather, um, nasty one, you know, it's, and, uh, that finally stops Toria marrying.
mels/lockwood_1980_008.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_008.pt|Well, yes, but then, of course, you know, I can remember when I go back to the days of my childhood and the neighborhood where I lived, um, there were a lot of, um, Victorian widows, and it was a generally recognized thing in the family that a daughter would stay home and look after her mama, one daughter never married.
mels/lockwood_1980_009.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_009.pt|So that isn't all that extraordinary, but, uh, she and point of fact, Queen Alexandra didn't want any of her daughters to marry.
mels/lockwood_1980_010.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_010.pt|She tried to stop Louise and she tried to stop Mord, and she failed there, but she didn't fail with Toria.
mels/lockwood_1980_011.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_011.pt|And then, um, it's just the last scene that more than 30 years have passed.
mels/lockwood_1980_012.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_012.pt|Oh, yeah, super costumes, but no room to put them on.
mels/lockwood_1980_013.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_013.pt|You've ever been backstage at the ambassadors theater.
mels/lockwood_1980_014.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_014.pt|It's literally two by four, just about as large as the area we are sitting in at this moment.
mels/lockwood_1980_015.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_015.pt|I'm not counting the walls, just this.
mels/lockwood_1980_016.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_016.pt|And with all those costumes and a dresser and oneself and trying to, and they're underground, so you don't get any air.
mels/lockwood_1980_017.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_017.pt|Well, not really.
mels/lockwood_1980_018.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_018.pt|No, it's a very tiny stage.
mels/lockwood_1980_019.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_019.pt|And, you know, we came, we opened this play at the Birmingham Rep, which is the new Birmingham Rep, which is an enormous stage, and the wings go on forever, and the quick change rooms were larger than the dressing rooms at the ambassadors.
mels/lockwood_1980_020.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_020.pt|So we were thoroughly spoiled, you know, and, um, the dressing rooms themselves were very roomy, and lovely, devanned, lie down on.
mels/lockwood_1980_021.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_021.pt|There's just nothing, but all the rest on.
mels/lockwood_1980_022.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_022.pt|Well, that was what I always wanted to be.
mels/lockwood_1980_023.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_023.pt|I didn't think about being a, um, what they call a legit actress.
mels/lockwood_1980_024.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_024.pt|I wanted to be a musical comedy, because, um, my mother loved the theater, and she was, um, what they call nowadays a movie buff.
mels/lockwood_1980_025.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_025.pt|So I went to see all the pictures with her.
mels/lockwood_1980_026.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_026.pt|She always took me to the pictures.
mels/lockwood_1980_027.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_027.pt|And when I talk about the films that I can remember, Dorothecish and Lillian Gish and, um, Esther Rolston, and, um, I can remember what I could must have been all of seven or eight years old, taking myself off to the Crystal Palace before it was burnt down.
mels/lockwood_1980_028.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_028.pt|There was a great big cinema in the Crystal Palace, and one Christmas they were playing Peter Pan.
mels/lockwood_1980_029.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_029.pt|And, uh, there was an actress called Betty Bronson playing Peter Pan, and Mary Brann playing Wendy, and I went every single afternoon, never dreaming that in, oh, heaven knows how many years time I would be playing Peter Pan, play at four times on the London stage, quite extraordinary.
mels/lockwood_1980_030.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_030.pt|Oh, yes, I mean, I wanted to marry Jack Buchanan.
mels/lockwood_1980_031.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_031.pt|He was my absolute idol, Jack Buchanan, and Benny Hale, and Elsie Randolph, and Evelyn Lay, and Jesse Matthews, and went to see them all.
mels/lockwood_1980_032.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_032.pt|My mother couldn't, said that was far too much, so we had to wait till they came to stretch them all, Lewis Shum, or one of those places, and then we used to go and see it.
mels/lockwood_1980_033.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_033.pt|And, um, I can remember seeing Jack Buchanan, uh, with the little girl called Marjorie Robertson, who became an illegal.
mels/lockwood_1980_034.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_034.pt|Oh, yes, well, only charity shows, because we weren't allowed to work professionally until we were 12, and, uh, then you had to have a license between, between the age of 12 and 14, because 14 at that time was school leaving age.
mels/lockwood_1980_035.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_035.pt|But, uh, the only shows I did before the age of 12 was charity, and, um, from 12 onwards, uh, I was, I did quite a few things.
mels/lockwood_1980_036.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_036.pt|I was in no cards, Cavalcade, and unfortunately I had to leave that because, um, I heard a four letter word in the theatre, and she said, you're never going to enter that theatre again, and I never did great to my disappointment.
mels/lockwood_1980_037.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_037.pt|Well, after that, before I, you ever found out what the word meant by yourself, and I can vividly remember my mother saying, and I only know that word, because I nursed the soldiers.
mels/lockwood_1980_038.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_038.pt|No, she didn't, no, she didn't, but, um, she always encouraged me, because, um, she knew that my father, when he was a boy, had wanted to go into the theatre, and, um, he was never allowed to, of course.
mels/lockwood_1980_039.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_039.pt|And, no, she encouraged me, because, um, you know, she enjoyed going to the theatre, and she enjoyed going to the cinema.
mels/lockwood_1980_040.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_040.pt|Oh, good heavens, my father more than that, about 67.
mels/lockwood_1980_041.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_041.pt|It was, it was a life of getting up at five o'clock in the morning, and going to bed at nine o'clock at night, and, uh, I must have done it, you know, without stopping for about 12 years, and, uh, finally in 1949, I was getting such terrible film scripts, and, um, I thought, we know, I've had enough of this, and I must go back to the theatre.
mels/lockwood_1980_042.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_042.pt|It's so strange, really, you know, when someone gets older and older, and you think there can't be many more people than you, yet, everybody talks about it, everybody remembers it, and the young generation come up, they see it on television, and I don't know what there is about that film.
mels/lockwood_1980_043.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_043.pt|Oh, don't tell me, well, everything calls to fasten anything out of the ordinary calls to fasten those days, didn't it?
mels/lockwood_1980_044.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_044.pt|I mean, we're going back to 1945, and just because we showed a bit of cleavage.
mels/lockwood_1980_045.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_045.pt|Um, I don't know, and it was simply the critics saying it was bored in, it was salacious, and it was, uh, or, they used every adjective under the sun, and Queen Mary was coming to the premiere, and she should not be allowed to see this film, and it was, it was that kind of headline that made it.
mels/lockwood_1980_046.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_046.pt|Yes, absolutely fabulous, and I can remember a very funny story.
mels/lockwood_1980_047.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_047.pt|They said the GI's, they were all flocking in to see it, and they'd all been all this talk about the cleavage, and they all insisted on going into the circle.
mels/lockwood_1980_048.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_048.pt|Everything's changed, so it's, it's all so extraordinary now, isn't it?
mels/lockwood_1980_049.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_049.pt|I mean, um, it's really rather mind boggling when you think what goes, what did people have asked me that question?
mels/lockwood_1980_050.pt|pitch/lockwood_1980_050.pt|I don't know, I don't know how to answer that question.
