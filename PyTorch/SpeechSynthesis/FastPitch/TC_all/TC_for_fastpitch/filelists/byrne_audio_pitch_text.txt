mels/byrne_1995-04-14_003.pt|pitch/byrne_1995-04-14_003.pt|I know you have an answer to this and that's that's specifically before they get on the telephone to us the question I'm asking you and I want to hear the answer.
mels/byrne_1995-04-14_004.pt|pitch/byrne_1995-04-14_004.pt|The seas must have been, we are told teaming with fish with lobster and and crab and and wonderful fish of all kind.
mels/byrne_1995-04-14_005.pt|pitch/byrne_1995-04-14_005.pt|And of course, people who didn't live near the sea anyway, it was a long, it was a long way to go.
mels/byrne_1995-04-14_006.pt|pitch/byrne_1995-04-14_006.pt|This is a fascinating one from Brede's Lynch in in a Shannon County cork and she tells us my maternal grandmother's maiden name was Dalton and she was born and grew up in Tipperary town.

mels/byrne_1995-04-14_009.pt|pitch/byrne_1995-04-14_009.pt|In the course of conversation the American woman asked my mother where she grew up.

mels/byrne_1995-04-14_011.pt|pitch/byrne_1995-04-14_011.pt|On hearing this the American visitor became very emotional and asked her the family any connection with Richard Dalton.
mels/byrne_1995-04-14_012.pt|pitch/byrne_1995-04-14_012.pt|My mother said that Richard Dalton had been her grandfather.
mels/byrne_1995-04-14_013.pt|pitch/byrne_1995-04-14_013.pt|At that point the guest burst into tears and explained that for as long as she could remember her mother had prayed each day of her life for Richard Dalton and went on to relate how her mother and uncle had come to be in America.
mels/byrne_1995-04-14_014.pt|pitch/byrne_1995-04-14_014.pt|The famine was at his height and her mother and uncle were infants.

mels/byrne_1995-04-14_017.pt|pitch/byrne_1995-04-14_017.pt|He took the two babies back to Tipperary the following day he managed to get their mother identified and buried.

mels/byrne_1995-04-14_025.pt|pitch/byrne_1995-04-14_025.pt|An odd view I would think Catherine Quinn says I think we're looking back too much we should leave the dead rest and Anne Horgan says this famine program is bringing up old wounds on the day when people should be looking forward to something that would have a more unifying effect on the day the Anglo-Arys document is being announced.

mels/byrne_2009-02-21_015.pt|pitch/byrne_2009-02-21_015.pt|Then of course he got to the stage where he had to turn on the radio and he had to say hello gay.
mels/byrne_2009-02-21_016.pt|pitch/byrne_2009-02-21_016.pt|Now Ronan would be in bed of nights when the late late show was on, but one particular night he was about 22 months, 22 months and he was on well with a little cold and we took him downstairs for a while.
mels/byrne_2009-02-21_017.pt|pitch/byrne_2009-02-21_017.pt|And the late late show was on and I had just sat down with him when he pointed the TV and said gay bird.
mels/byrne_2009-02-21_018.pt|pitch/byrne_2009-02-21_018.pt|And I asked Ronan how did he know and he said his talking.

mels/byrne_2009-02-21_029.pt|pitch/byrne_2009-02-21_029.pt|Nucky idea, trombones, full brass combined with non-singing voices, all of that terrific new sound and everybody thought Ray Connoff was a new boy on the block, but he was far from big a new boy on the block because he was a great arranger.
mels/byrne_2009-02-21_030.pt|pitch/byrne_2009-02-21_030.pt|Going way, way back he arranged for some of the best boys in the business, some of the best big bands in the business, Benny and Len Miller and Old Old Len Miller was a good arranger too and a whole stack of people.
mels/byrne_2009-02-21_031.pt|pitch/byrne_2009-02-21_031.pt|But anyway he did arrangements for a lot of people, small, big, all of that sort of thing.
mels/byrne_2009-02-21_032.pt|pitch/byrne_2009-02-21_032.pt|He told a great story about joining Bunny Berrigan's band in 1938 and he was a new young fella on the scene with a trombone and the Berrigan outfit was his first big name band and he hoped to write some arrangements for it.
mels/byrne_2009-02-21_033.pt|pitch/byrne_2009-02-21_033.pt|But anyway when he joined the band he said,
mels/byrne_2009-02-21_034.pt|pitch/byrne_2009-02-21_034.pt|I was practically in my teens and Bunny said my salary would be $60 a week.
mels/byrne_2009-02-21_035.pt|pitch/byrne_2009-02-21_035.pt|I thought he was talking about $60 a month but it wasn't, it was $60 a week and I never saw so much Bunny in my life before.
mels/byrne_2009-02-21_036.pt|pitch/byrne_2009-02-21_036.pt|I'd just come up from a small town with my trombone, it was my first big break.
mels/byrne_2009-02-21_037.pt|pitch/byrne_2009-02-21_037.pt|So I mentioned to him that I also were arranged and he asked me to bring something around for him to hear.
mels/byrne_2009-02-21_038.pt|pitch/byrne_2009-02-21_038.pt|So I took a couple of things along and Bunny thought they were fine when we played them, put them in the book and so the band started playing them every night we were on stage.
mels/byrne_2009-02-21_039.pt|pitch/byrne_2009-02-21_039.pt|Bunny seemed to like them so after a few weeks I asked him if he was going to pay me something like extra on top of the weeks for the arrangements because it was always understood that people got extra money for arrangements.
mels/byrne_2009-02-21_040.pt|pitch/byrne_2009-02-21_040.pt|You know I said to him what's the deal?
mels/byrne_2009-02-21_041.pt|pitch/byrne_2009-02-21_041.pt|So finally he settled on 35 bucks on arrangement that's $35 per arrangement and I thought that was great.
mels/byrne_2009-02-21_042.pt|pitch/byrne_2009-02-21_042.pt|I thought that was terrific Bunny, we're very happy.
mels/byrne_2009-02-21_043.pt|pitch/byrne_2009-02-21_043.pt|So 3, 4, 5, 6 weeks went by and I still hadn't got any money for the arrangements and by this time I don't know a couple more so I reminded Bunny about the talk we'd had and that I still hadn't been paid by him so he seems surprised and he asked me what had we agreed?
mels/byrne_2009-02-21_044.pt|pitch/byrne_2009-02-21_044.pt|And I told him where we agreed 35 bucks on arrangement and he said 35 bucks that's far too little will make it 50.
mels/byrne_2009-02-21_045.pt|pitch/byrne_2009-02-21_045.pt|I said 50, he said 50 will make it 50, I said that's terrific, that's wonderful, 50.
mels/byrne_2009-02-21_046.pt|pitch/byrne_2009-02-21_046.pt|You know he said he raised my price five times I was with the band and I never got a single cent.
mels/byrne_1984-12-05_001.pt|pitch/byrne_1984-12-05_001.pt|well now welcome back, just coming up to ten past ten, I'm joined now by an old friend of ours who really needs no introduction.

mels/byrne_1984-12-05_003.pt|pitch/byrne_1984-12-05_003.pt|But it lasts as it were, it's a formal and, uh, richly deserved recognition of the enormous personal contribution he's made to Irish music and folklore, and indeed broadcasting down through the years, and indeed for making it possible for many others to make their contribution in term.
mels/byrne_1984-12-05_004.pt|pitch/byrne_1984-12-05_004.pt|Traditional musicians all over the country, uh, know him intimately and extremely well, uh, programs like Job of Journeywork, uh, Mokyul who, Humors of Dunningbrook, all that sort of thing, and the name of course is Kiran Makmahuna, powerful new desk job, Kiran, to take you off the roads.
mels/byrne_1984-12-05_005.pt|pitch/byrne_1984-12-05_005.pt|So it's not filling in forms and pushing members around, no?

mels/byrne_1984-12-05_008.pt|pitch/byrne_1984-12-05_008.pt|You mean the technique is high, the actual technique standard is high.

mels/byrne_1984-12-05_011.pt|pitch/byrne_1984-12-05_011.pt|Yes, and it has, it has extended of course, the criticism is very often made unfairly.
mels/byrne_1984-12-05_012.pt|pitch/byrne_1984-12-05_012.pt|I think of the clansies is that they're commercial as if that makes them somehow sunny or something like that.
mels/byrne_1984-12-05_013.pt|pitch/byrne_1984-12-05_013.pt|But they do, do you reckon that it was mainly the clansies who caused that resurgence?
mels/byrne_1984-12-05_014.pt|pitch/byrne_1984-12-05_014.pt|But you slugged up and down this country, Kiran.
mels/byrne_1984-12-05_015.pt|pitch/byrne_1984-12-05_015.pt|Now, come on, you've been out of the long time and you carried your tape recorder when they were heavy and you set up all sorts of recordings.
mels/byrne_1984-12-05_016.pt|pitch/byrne_1984-12-05_016.pt|I mean, did you actually set up recordings in pubs and, and, and school halls and, and all sorts of things?
mels/byrne_1984-12-05_017.pt|pitch/byrne_1984-12-05_017.pt|Yes, I'm still there talking to Kiran Makmahuna, I'm just saying to him that the standard of music in Ireland generally, not only in his particular field, but it, well, what's coming out of the schools of music, classical fields, are never higher astonishing kids doing astonishing things with pianos and trombones and trombones and violins and so on.
mels/byrne_1984-12-05_018.pt|pitch/byrne_1984-12-05_018.pt|You, you reckon not, Kiran, interesting you should say that now that you mentioned it, because a lot of people have this impression that everybody should be on and doing their thing and so on.
mels/byrne_1984-12-05_019.pt|pitch/byrne_1984-12-05_019.pt|You don't, you don't, you don't, you're a terribly easygoing man, Kiran Makmahuna, for as long as I've known you, I've never seen you sort of flustered or in a temper or getting yourself tied and not serve anything.
mels/byrne_1984-12-05_020.pt|pitch/byrne_1984-12-05_020.pt|Are you really like that, in spite of you too in your field get a fair amount of stick from listeners of yours, particularly listeners of what you should be doing this and you shouldn't be doing that and you should have this one on, you shouldn't have you know of, are you easygoing all the time?
mels/byrne_1984-12-05_021.pt|pitch/byrne_1984-12-05_021.pt|Are you, have you a philosophy underlying this, I mean, did you take a decision at some stage to say I'm going to be laid back and easygoing or, I always think that even at the height, at the extremity of a temper, you would all, you would say things like, oh dear, can't talk either, no, indeed, and I remember, I don't know which it was of your children that, that, that the gorgeous red-headed lady had just delivered to you in the hospital and gole with the Kathleen and I went to visit many, many moons ago.
mels/byrne_1984-12-05_022.pt|pitch/byrne_1984-12-05_022.pt|What about the abuse that you get, you were talking there about the abuse that you get from people on, on what sort of basis do you get abused?
mels/byrne_2005-05-02_001.pt|pitch/byrne_2005-05-02_001.pt|thank you very much indeed ladies and gentlemen for that lovely warm welcome.
mels/byrne_2005-05-02_002.pt|pitch/byrne_2005-05-02_002.pt|It's going to be a lovely lovely experience.
mels/byrne_2005-05-02_003.pt|pitch/byrne_2005-05-02_003.pt|Now, I have to explain to you that this competition actually was spawned from a competition organized by the Dublin Doctlans Development Authority in the Abbey Theatre.
mels/byrne_2005-05-02_004.pt|pitch/byrne_2005-05-02_004.pt|Our director, Kevin Hawk produced that show and it was four the over 60s of that area taking part in a talent competition and Kevin Hawk decided having seen that that it would be a very good idea for a radio program and so having scoured all over Ireland, here we are tonight for a lovely show and a result at the end of it and we'd like to thank Jerry Kelly of the Doctlans Development Authority for his kind sponsorship of all the prizes on the show tonight and let me straight away introduce to you our adjudicators for this evening.
mels/byrne_2005-05-02_005.pt|pitch/byrne_2005-05-02_005.pt|Don't give them an individual round of applause.
mels/byrne_2005-05-02_006.pt|pitch/byrne_2005-05-02_006.pt|First of all, you've spoiled them and secondly, you'd be worn out by the time the end of the evening comes.
mels/byrne_2005-05-02_007.pt|pitch/byrne_2005-05-02_007.pt|We have singer Austin Gaffney, an old friend and colleague of ours.
mels/byrne_2005-05-02_008.pt|pitch/byrne_2005-05-02_008.pt|We have broadcaster Maxi Ditto, actress Geraldine Plunkett and Kayleigh House presenter Kiran Hanran and the chairman of our adjudicating panel is Jerry Kelly of the Dublin Doctlans Development Authority.
mels/byrne_2005-05-02_009.pt|pitch/byrne_2005-05-02_009.pt|He will only vote in the case of a tie and his vote will be the casting vote.
mels/byrne_2005-05-02_010.pt|pitch/byrne_2005-05-02_010.pt|Now you can welcome everybody in the final that is everybody you'll see on stage here tonight and tomorrow night will receive a beautifully engraved Dublin crystal vase vase or vase and in addition to that our third place finalist will receive 500 euro.
mels/byrne_2005-05-02_011.pt|pitch/byrne_2005-05-02_011.pt|Our second place will receive 750 and our outright winner tomorrow night will receive a thousand euro.
mels/byrne_2005-05-02_012.pt|pitch/byrne_2005-05-02_012.pt|I'd like you to put your hands together especially to welcome a man who's been with all the contestants right from the very beginning all around the country and has worked extremely hard with and for them and we'd like you to welcome our musical director Andy O'Cala, there he is.
mels/byrne_2005-05-02_013.pt|pitch/byrne_2005-05-02_013.pt|Andy has been with them all the way through and nursed them through their musical difficulties where and when they arose.
mels/byrne_2005-05-02_014.pt|pitch/byrne_2005-05-02_014.pt|Right, first up this evening is Tony Kenny representing County Offering.
mels/byrne_2005-05-02_015.pt|pitch/byrne_2005-05-02_015.pt|No, not this particular Tony Kenny was born and banner her and has lived in for a ban for over 50 years.
mels/byrne_2005-05-02_016.pt|pitch/byrne_2005-05-02_016.pt|He retired from the Department of Local Government in 1989 where he worked as a building inspector and was known to many as the grant man.
mels/byrne_2005-05-02_017.pt|pitch/byrne_2005-05-02_017.pt|Since retiring he's had time to pursue his two great loves of music and wood turning.
mels/byrne_2005-05-02_018.pt|pitch/byrne_2005-05-02_018.pt|Now he played with the Brosnicide Cady ban for many years including when they came first in the All Ireland Flanacule in 58 and 59.
mels/byrne_2005-05-02_019.pt|pitch/byrne_2005-05-02_019.pt|He turned 80 last July and had a great advantage of this show is that is the only show you're allowed to announce everybody's age.
mels/byrne_2005-05-02_020.pt|pitch/byrne_2005-05-02_020.pt|Not only that the older the better because they go for the sympathy vote.
mels/byrne_2005-05-02_021.pt|pitch/byrne_2005-05-02_021.pt|Turn 80 last July had a hell of a party and that's because he said when he was growing up there was no such thing as birthday parties ever so he was making up for last time.
mels/byrne_2005-05-02_022.pt|pitch/byrne_2005-05-02_022.pt|He's going to sing Bully Mary of our guide which welcome please Tony.
mels/byrne_1974-10-28_001.pt|pitch/byrne_1974-10-28_001.pt|I would like to think he would, but quite frankly, I steer clear of this kind of thing, John, because I get actually embarrassed when you tie up the late show with sociological implications of that kind.
mels/byrne_1974-10-28_002.pt|pitch/byrne_1974-10-28_002.pt|If you want to say that, or if you're a non-unmiss social historian, or if somebody like Jack Daly knows to say that, that's fine, bully for them and bully for us, but I tend not to want to get into that kind of area.
mels/byrne_1974-10-28_003.pt|pitch/byrne_1974-10-28_003.pt|I think probably one of the answers given by A controller programs at one stage in one of his defenses of the late late show when we had transgressed some law or other, he described it as a relevant show, a relevant show by which I presume he meant that it was relevant to what was going on in Ireland in any particular week.
mels/byrne_1974-10-28_004.pt|pitch/byrne_1974-10-28_004.pt|I think it would be a combination of both in that over and above all of that, I reckon that my job as producer of the late late show as distinct from presenter of it, as producer of the late late show, my job would be to entertain as many people as possible on a Saturday night, and within certain defined limits, I would do almost anything in order to achieve that.
mels/byrne_1974-10-28_005.pt|pitch/byrne_1974-10-28_005.pt|I think that I'm all fashioned enough and broadcasting to believe that I don't want a broadcast at thin air, and I think the one salient fact about the late late show, as distinct from all the impressions, opinions, wish for thinking, thoughts put forward about it over the last 13 years or so, the one salient fact about it is that according to our figures, more people tune in every Saturday night to watch the late late show than any other program in the schedule, by and large, given some exception.
mels/byrne_1974-10-28_006.pt|pitch/byrne_1974-10-28_006.pt|I think if that choice had been presented five years ago, it would have been my inclination to go for the lighter thing, but we've learned over the past five years that either tastes have changed, you can say progress or mature it if you want to, I just say changed, to the extent that for example, last year in the last season, the season just finished, I mean in June.
mels/byrne_1974-10-28_007.pt|pitch/byrne_1974-10-28_007.pt|Take the four top-time rating shows, that is to say the shows which kept viewers tuned in right to the very end, it's a rather strange mix of shows.
mels/byrne_1974-10-28_008.pt|pitch/byrne_1974-10-28_008.pt|One of them would have been the Noell Persson birthday party, now that could have been foreseen, you would say it's a nice show, nostalgic, light, very entertaining, and everybody loves Noell Persson.
mels/byrne_1974-10-28_009.pt|pitch/byrne_1974-10-28_009.pt|The other shows though would have been Lyle Watson and the survivors of the Ande's crash and also a long discussion on the afterlife of all things, but extraordinarily enough as well as those, one of the top-time rating late late shows last season was our complete discussion on education.
mels/byrne_1974-10-28_010.pt|pitch/byrne_1974-10-28_010.pt|Now the point I'm trying to make is that if five years ago somebody had said, let's do two hours on the subject of education in Ireland, I would have said, you know, we're going to die on this, no way will they stay tuned to this, you know, we are on to hiding, to beat all hiding, but now we go ahead and do it anyway, and to rather our great edification and pleasure, we find yes they were interested and they were so interested that they stayed with that subject right to the end.
mels/byrne_1974-10-28_011.pt|pitch/byrne_1974-10-28_011.pt|So now to answer your question, I would want to see it laid out the decision as to whether we go with it or stay light would very much depend on the exigencies of the moment, what we're doing this week as against what we have possibly next week and so on.
mels/byrne_1974-10-28_012.pt|pitch/byrne_1974-10-28_012.pt|I try to keep the mix changing all the time.
