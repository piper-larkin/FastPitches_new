wavs/cronkite_2001_001.wav|every day, every day, every day.
wavs/cronkite_2001_002.wav|Not on.
wavs/cronkite_2001_003.wav|That's not quite the term for it, Larry.
wavs/cronkite_2001_004.wav|I don't, I don't miss being on the air.
wavs/cronkite_2001_005.wav|I miss not being at the center of, uh, of gravity there where you're getting the shore together, getting the broadcast together where you're, uh, really setting the agenda that day for people's consideration.
wavs/cronkite_2001_006.wav|That's an important job and, uh, I miss that.
wavs/cronkite_2001_007.wav|Absolutely.
wavs/cronkite_2001_008.wav|That's, that's what a reporter wants to be, whether they write it for a newspaper.
wavs/cronkite_2001_009.wav|No, I'm not so sure of that.
wavs/cronkite_2001_010.wav|There's something about being on the inside first, about being the first to know something or one of the earlier ones to know something, harboring it, working with it, molding it for the public's, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, advice and information.
wavs/cronkite_2001_011.wav|Uh, that's, I've, I've been credited with that, or devided with it, depending on how you look up on what a reporter's job should be.
wavs/cronkite_2001_012.wav|Uh, I was enthusiastic about space flight.
wavs/cronkite_2001_013.wav|I was very critical of many of the decisions that NASA made in the course of getting the man up to the moon eventually and then into the shuttles.
wavs/cronkite_2001_014.wav|Uh, but at the same time, uh, the enthusiasm of the idea of human beings getting out there into space and finally getting to that distant orb, I thought was a most exciting adventure of our time.
wavs/cronkite_2001_015.wav|And I think it will live as such in the 20th century.
wavs/cronkite_2001_016.wav|I think when people look back at the 20th century with all these incredible inventions, these technological improvements, these, particularly in medicine for Evan Sakes and everywhere else, atomic energy for goodness' sake, all of it.
wavs/cronkite_2001_017.wav|The one thing that will live 400 years from now will be man's escape from his own environment and landing on the moon, just as Columbus's trip to America 400 years ago, uh, is the one date the kids remember today.
wavs/cronkite_2001_018.wav|Uh, emotionally, certainly.
wavs/cronkite_2001_019.wav|Yeah.
wavs/cronkite_2001_020.wav|Yeah.
wavs/cronkite_2001_021.wav|It's the only time I really didn't caught up and thought I was going to lose it and did for a brief second managed to come back.
wavs/cronkite_2001_022.wav|You know, we, uh, I'm not ashamed of that in any way.
wavs/cronkite_2001_023.wav|Barnett Shaw talking on here last night about a motion, showing emotion on the air.
wavs/cronkite_2001_024.wav|I think he was entirely right.
wavs/cronkite_2001_025.wav|I don't think we should hide it.
wavs/cronkite_2001_026.wav|Why should we?
wavs/cronkite_2001_027.wav|We're presumably human beings and are affected by these things.
wavs/cronkite_2001_028.wav|Uh, the, uh, in, uh, in that case, uh, case like that, you know, we, we reporters are very much like other emergency room workers, a policeman, fireman, nurses, doctors who go, who see the most horrible things happen.
wavs/cronkite_2001_029.wav|And, uh, we've only learned recently that there is a psychological effect that there needs to be trauma treatment for that sort of thing.
wavs/cronkite_2001_030.wav|It's only when you get back to your hotel room or back home or whatever that it hits you.
wavs/cronkite_2001_031.wav|What's, what's happened in the rest of the time your adrenaline is flowing and getting the job done just like those policemen, firemen, nurses and doctors.
wavs/cronkite_2001_032.wav|And, uh, that was much the same thing that day.
wavs/cronkite_2001_033.wav|Yeah.
wavs/cronkite_2001_034.wav|Well, the, the, it happened within a month that for I stepped down when the, when they shot it to Ronald Reagan.
wavs/cronkite_2001_035.wav|And right away, I was in Moscow already.
wavs/cronkite_2001_036.wav|I'd, I'd take it a trip through doing some documentaries.
wavs/cronkite_2001_037.wav|And I was in Moscow.
wavs/cronkite_2001_038.wav|And here I was halfway around the world.
wavs/cronkite_2001_039.wav|And here was the story and a tempered assassination of the president of the United States.
wavs/cronkite_2001_040.wav|And of course, the series wounding, uh, and of course, there have been many really important stories in those years that have affected the course of mankind that I would like to have covered.
wavs/cronkite_2007_001.wav|if nothing else of value comes out of the war in Iraq, it seems to me we will at least have learned some things from it.
wavs/cronkite_2007_002.wav|For instance, policymakers now should know not to invade a country without first learning something about its history and its people.
wavs/cronkite_2007_003.wav|Today, surely, they know to plan for the aftermath of any military action they undertake.
wavs/cronkite_2007_004.wav|Bush's father, President George H. W. Bush, launched the first Gulf War in 1990.
wavs/cronkite_2007_005.wav|He did so with the endorsement of the United Nations, but this invasion of Iraq was not approved by the UN.
wavs/cronkite_2007_006.wav|What made the difference?
wavs/cronkite_2007_007.wav|In the United Nations, and we were able to lead a UN force to write that wrong.
wavs/cronkite_2007_008.wav|We were the good guys then.
wavs/cronkite_2007_009.wav|In the current war, our case was not at all clear to others.
wavs/cronkite_2007_010.wav|We had no UN sanction, and we began to look like the bully on the block.
wavs/cronkite_2007_011.wav|There's another lesson we should take from this terrible misadventure.
wavs/cronkite_2007_012.wav|Before the invasion, Colin Powell tried to explain something very basic to George Bush.
wavs/cronkite_2007_013.wav|Powell quoted what he said was the pottery barn rule.
wavs/cronkite_2007_014.wav|If you break it, you bought it.
wavs/cronkite_2007_015.wav|If you destroy a government and social order, you are obligated to replace them.
wavs/cronkite_2007_016.wav|You own that government's responsibilities.
wavs/cronkite_2007_017.wav|I should say we own them for it wasn't just George Bush, Dick Cheney, and Donald Rumsfeld who broke Iraq.
wavs/cronkite_2007_018.wav|It was the United States.
wavs/cronkite_2007_019.wav|The entire nation volunteered for this war.
wavs/cronkite_2007_020.wav|In October of 2002, the two houses of Congress passed a joint resolution to authorize the use of force against Iraq.
wavs/cronkite_2007_021.wav|It passed with a large majority.
wavs/cronkite_2007_022.wav|Most members of Congress and the American public were convinced that if we failed to act, there was danger of a nuclear attack.
wavs/cronkite_2007_023.wav|In the future, we should be more wary of false alarms.
wavs/cronkite_2007_024.wav|Now we are stuck there.
wavs/cronkite_2007_025.wav|We're not sure just how or when we can leave honorably.
wavs/cronkite_2007_026.wav|How can we pull out of Iraq without civil war exploding in a blood bath?
wavs/cronkite_2007_027.wav|The leading Democratic presidential candidates now say we should not be as thoughtless getting out as we were getting in.
wavs/cronkite_2007_028.wav|And Bush has said he expects some American troops to be in Iraq for years.
wavs/cronkite_2007_029.wav|Maybe that's our penance for letting George Bush and Dick Cheney stampede us into war.
wavs/cronkite_2007_030.wav|Maybe that's our punishment for not asking the hard questions early enough.
wavs/cronkite_2007_031.wav|I guess the ultimate lesson is that being a democracy, we the people are responsible for the actions of our leaders.
wavs/cronkite_2007_032.wav|Bush's aggressive talk about Iran and its nuclear ambitions is a case in point.
wavs/cronkite_2007_033.wav|Now we learn that the Iranians stopped developing nuclear weapons in 2003.
wavs/cronkite_2007_034.wav|We now are in the midst of the primary campaigns for next year's presidential election.
wavs/cronkite_2007_035.wav|Perhaps we will pay closer attention to what the candidates have to say about America's role in the world.
wavs/cronkite_2007_036.wav|So what kind of person with what kind of attitude and ideas do you think should be making decisions about that?
wavs/cronkite_2007_037.wav|Surely the most important lesson Iraq teaches us.
wavs/cronkite_1963_001.wav|there has been an attempt that's perhaps you know now on the life of president Kennedy.
wavs/cronkite_1963_002.wav|He was wounded in an automobile driving from Dallas airport into downtown Dallas, along with governor Connolly of Texas, they've been taken to Parkland Hospital there where their condition is as yet unknown.
wavs/cronkite_1963_003.wav|We have not been told their condition at Dallas in the downtown hotel room, a group had been gathered to hear President Kennedy when he was waiting his arrival.
wavs/cronkite_1963_004.wav|Let's switch down there now where Eddie Barker of KRLD is on the air.
wavs/cronkite_1963_005.wav|This is Walter Cronkite back at the CBS newsroom in New York.
wavs/cronkite_1963_006.wav|We have just been advised from Dallas that blood transfusions are being given to President Kennedy.
wavs/cronkite_1963_007.wav|Well, that's the repeat of something that you heard reported to you directly a moment ago from and that is the rumor that has reached them at the hotel that the president is dead, totally unconfirmed apparently as yet.
wavs/cronkite_1963_008.wav|However, let's go back to KRLD in Dallas.
wavs/cronkite_1963_009.wav|That was Eddie Barker at our affiliate KRLD in Dallas, Texas, speaking from the room where President Kennedy had been scheduled to make an address to three Dallas organizations, but an assassin's bullets cut him down on the way to that meeting from the airport.
wavs/cronkite_1963_010.wav|It was just an hour ago that the incident took place.
wavs/cronkite_1963_011.wav|We have just learned however, ever that Father Huber, one of the two priests called into the room, has administered the last sacrament of the church to President Kennedy.
wavs/cronkite_1963_012.wav|Regarding the probable assassin, the sheriff's officers have taken a young man into custody at the scene.
wavs/cronkite_1963_013.wav|A man 25 years old, we are...
wavs/cronkite_1963_014.wav|We just have a report from our correspondent Dan, rather in Dallas, that he has confirmed that President Kennedy is dead.
wavs/cronkite_1963_015.wav|There is still no official confirmation of this, however, it's a report from our correspondent Dan, rather, in Dallas, Texas.
wavs/cronkite_1963_016.wav|President Thou is fine.
wavs/cronkite_1963_017.wav|Throughout the streets of Dallas, the Dallas police had been augmented by some 400 policemen called in on their day off because there were some fears and concerns in Dallas that there might be demonstrations at least that could embarrass the President because it was only on October the 24th that our ambassador to the United Nations, Adley Stevenson, was assaulted in Dallas, leaving a dinner meeting there.
wavs/cronkite_1963_018.wav|From Dallas, Texas, the flash, apparently official President Kennedy died at 1 p.m. central standard time, 2 o'clock Eastern Standard Time, some 38 minutes ago.
wavs/cronkite_1963_019.wav|Vice President Lyndon Johnson has left the hospital in Dallas, but we do not know to where he has proceeded.
wavs/cronkite_1963_020.wav|Presumably, he will be taking the oath of office shortly and become the 36th President of the United States.
wavs/cronkite_1990_001.wav|oh no, not shocking, but it's awfully pleasant, I must say.
wavs/cronkite_1990_002.wav|You know, particularly after not having been on daily news for nine years now, it's a long time, it's amazing to hold a whole half a generation practically.
wavs/cronkite_1990_003.wav|I was, I was very pleased with that reception, obviously.
wavs/cronkite_1990_004.wav|That's the, I have the slightest idea.
wavs/cronkite_1990_005.wav|I, uh, I don't spend much time examining my own navel.
wavs/cronkite_1990_006.wav|I don't really know what, uh, what, what that might be from really.
wavs/cronkite_1990_007.wav|I, I've always, uh, and doing the broadcast and, and my life, I've tried to be me.
wavs/cronkite_1990_008.wav|I have never tried to be anything else.
wavs/cronkite_1990_009.wav|I've never taken any diction lessons, obviously, or or electrocution lessons or performance lessons of any kind.
wavs/cronkite_1990_010.wav|I've never, uh, never been an actor.
wavs/cronkite_1990_011.wav|I've, I've just tried to communicate as best I can, uh, what I consider to be the important news of the day.
wavs/cronkite_1990_012.wav|And, uh, that's doing my job.
wavs/cronkite_1990_013.wav|And if, uh, if that's the kind of happy rub off while I'm delighted.
wavs/cronkite_1990_014.wav|Well, I made the decision a long time before that I said I was going to step down from the daily, uh, journal, uh, mostly to just frank, quite frankly, to have more time to myself.
wavs/cronkite_1990_015.wav|That is a terribly demanding job, uh, not just the daily, uh, program, but also being the sort of lead broadcaster for the network.
wavs/cronkite_1990_016.wav|It meant that every time a story broke, you were there, which was, of course, the name of the game.
wavs/cronkite_1990_017.wav|That's where I wanted to be.
wavs/cronkite_1990_018.wav|You had to study constantly to do the space shots when we were having a lot of those.
wavs/cronkite_1990_019.wav|And, uh, they were all, uh, covered, uh, live.
wavs/cronkite_1990_020.wav|I spent a lot of time at Cape, uh, Kennedy now, or Cape Canaroa, yes, appears again.
wavs/cronkite_1990_021.wav|Uh, and, uh, and then, uh, of course, politics covering elections and conventions.
wavs/cronkite_1990_022.wav|That took a great deal of time.
wavs/cronkite_1990_023.wav|So it was, uh, it was, uh, really a very demanding job.
wavs/cronkite_1990_024.wav|Is it a demanding job?
wavs/cronkite_1990_025.wav|So I worked my way up to retirement.
wavs/cronkite_1990_026.wav|Unfortunately, I find it, uh, more demanding than, than the job of people asked me to do a lot of interesting things.
wavs/cronkite_1990_027.wav|And, uh, and that there be an interesting, I can't help but say yes.
wavs/cronkite_1990_028.wav|And, uh, like these books, and that, that was just really more out of personal interest than any particularly huge revenue out of them.
wavs/cronkite_1990_029.wav|Uh, the, um, but Betsy has taken now to standing over me with the phone rings.
wavs/cronkite_1990_030.wav|And she mows the word no and shakes her head violently and tries to shake me off because I really bite off more than I can chew.
wavs/cronkite_1990_031.wav|Uh, after, you know, almost 50 years of that, uh, it's, uh, was 40 years when I stepped down, I guess.
wavs/cronkite_1990_032.wav|But, uh, you, you get used to having that teleporter clacking in your ear and, uh, and, uh, and the breaking story and assigning forces and editing and writing.
wavs/cronkite_1990_033.wav|That's, that's, that's a very exciting business.
wavs/cronkite_1990_034.wav|And it's kind of hard to, to let, let go of that.
wavs/cronkite_1990_035.wav|Uh, I'd expected it to be difficult.
wavs/cronkite_1990_036.wav|And it hasn't been any more difficult than I anticipated.
wavs/cronkite_1990_037.wav|I actually, perhaps, even, perhaps a little less.
wavs/cronkite_1990_038.wav|Well, I think that, uh, that the Middle East is, uh, such a complex political problem.
wavs/cronkite_1990_039.wav|Uh, the motions are so high.
wavs/cronkite_1990_040.wav|The nature of, uh, Muslim fundamentalism is, uh, is so foreign to our concept of, of, of, uh, politics and, uh, and culture, cultural values and social values and so forth.
wavs/cronkite_1990_041.wav|Very difficult for us to understand the people and to get along with those people.
wavs/cronkite_1990_042.wav|Their rivalries between themselves are so great.
wavs/cronkite_1990_043.wav|They have never succeeded themselves in any kind of a meaningful alliance.
wavs/cronkite_1990_044.wav|I think for us to depend on our alliance with them, uh, is, uh, foolhardy.
wavs/cronkite_1990_045.wav|And I think we're getting in much deeper than, uh, then, good, prudent operation demands.
wavs/cronkite_1990_046.wav|And I'm just, uh, fearful that we're there for a long time, a very, very difficult circumstances and probably some loss of life, whether it's how, how, how great the loss of life is, depending on what the nature of the combat is, we might not have a full fledged war and still lose a lot of people over a period of time through, through, uh, the various kinds of violence and terrorism that those people can perpetrate.
wavs/cronkite_1990_047.wav|Because, uh, it's a major, uh, source of information for one thing.
wavs/cronkite_1990_048.wav|Uh, second of all, it's, uh, it's a major source of entertainment for the people.
wavs/cronkite_1990_049.wav|Can be provided with, uh, no cost to them.
wavs/cronkite_1990_050.wav|I can't see why in the world.
wavs/cronkite_1990_051.wav|You would want to, I want to change it.
wavs/cronkite_1990_052.wav|It's a, the logic simply says, why, why fiddle with something that works?
wavs/cronkite_1990_053.wav|Uh, if, you know, if you want to put something alongside of it, uh, that, uh, where you pay as long as it does not interfere with the flow of, uh, of, uh, programming, uh, obviously that's possible in a free society.
wavs/cronkite_1990_054.wav|But don't, don't supplant free television and radio with something else by government or any other reason.
wavs/cronkite_1990_055.wav|Well, I, uh, found sailing about 30 years ago a little more when I was racing automobiles and my small children were beginning to grow up and demanding some attention.
wavs/cronkite_1990_056.wav|Uh, and I realized there wasn't exactly a family support.
wavs/cronkite_1990_057.wav|So I, uh, was sort of looking around with something else and very serendipitously at the place we were summering, uh, in a, uh, north of, uh, New York City, uh, they were doing some small boat, very small boat sailing on a very small pond.
wavs/cronkite_1990_058.wav|I got involved in that and, uh, never looked back.
wavs/cronkite_1990_059.wav|It captured my imagination immediately.
wavs/cronkite_1990_060.wav|I'm kind of a Walter Mitty.
wavs/cronkite_1990_061.wav|I, uh, every time I get on the boat, I think I'm taking a load of tea to South Hampton or I'm out to meet the pirates off the shores of, of, uh, the Spanish main, uh, and, uh, that, this thing satisfies that kind of urge and I mean, I like being capped into my own ship.
wavs/cronkite_1990_062.wav|Uh, I think I'm a pretty good one.
wavs/cronkite_1990_063.wav|Uh, I'm, I'm incredibly calm.
wavs/cronkite_1990_064.wav|Despite the fact I'm not under normal circumstances, somehow whether it's C command seems to, uh, invest me with particularly strong characteristics, which is probably what I like as well.
wavs/cronkite_1990_065.wav|The book, I'm glad you asked.
wavs/cronkite_1990_066.wav|Uh, the book is West Wind, done with a superb artist, whose name Ray Ellis, internationally recognized.
wavs/cronkite_1990_067.wav|He's had a couple of very successful shows overseas.
wavs/cronkite_1990_068.wav|Uh, this is the third really.
wavs/cronkite_1990_069.wav|It turned out to be a trilogy, wasn't planned that way.
wavs/cronkite_1990_070.wav|Our first book was South by Southeast on the Southeast Coast United States, then North by Northeast, Northeast Coast United States.
wavs/cronkite_1990_071.wav|And this book West Wind, the covering the entire Western coast from San Juan Islands down to actually Ensenada, Mexico in a sense.
wavs/cronkite_1990_072.wav|The books are books of paintings.
wavs/cronkite_1990_073.wav|They're, they're, they're art books.
wavs/cronkite_1990_074.wav|Uh, I just do the text.
wavs/cronkite_1990_075.wav|They're really Ray Ellis's books.
wavs/cronkite_1990_076.wav|Beautiful, beautiful paintings, 90 to 100 paintings in the books of the coastal areas, uh, uh, on land, as well as from sea, uh, Ray travels these areas.
wavs/cronkite_1990_077.wav|I, of course, sail them.
wavs/cronkite_1990_078.wav|Uh, the, uh, we don't do that together.
wavs/cronkite_1990_079.wav|Uh, we sometimes join forces, but usually he does his book, he paints, and I do my book, and then we kind of, at the conjunction, say, well, here's a painting I ought to cover somehow or other in the writing, and here's something that I think is particularly important that perhaps you could do a little painting on.
wavs/cronkite_1990_080.wav|And, uh, this is the way the book comes together.
wavs/cronkite_1990_081.wav|Uh, just as soon as I write it.
wavs/cronkite_1990_082.wav|And, uh, I think that might be sometime in the next year or so.
wavs/cronkite_1990_083.wav|I'm working on it.
wavs/cronkite_1990_084.wav|Meanwhile, don't forget to buy West Wind, you can get it at your local bookstore.
wavs/cronkite_1979_001.wav|good evening, the world has never known a day quite like today, it faced the considerable uncertainties and dangers of the worst nuclear power plant accident of the atomic age, and the hard tonight is that it could get much worse.
wavs/cronkite_1979_002.wav|It is not an atomic explosion that is feared, the experts say that is impossible, but the spectre was raised to perhaps the next most serious kind of nuclear catastrophe, a massive release of radioactivity.
wavs/cronkite_1979_003.wav|The nuclear regulator regulatory commission cited that possibility with an announcement that while it is not likely, the potential is there for the ultimate risk of a meltdown at the three mile island atomic power plant outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
wavs/cronkite_1979_004.wav|Robert Shackney reports from Washington.
wavs/cronkite_1979_005.wav|Earlier on this incredible third day of the accident, confusion, contradiction, and questions clouded the atmosphere like atomic particles.
wavs/cronkite_1979_006.wav|Plant officials predicted radiation will continue to leak at least five more days.
wavs/cronkite_1979_007.wav|Governor Thornberg considered then rejected the evacuation of a million residents in four counties surrounding the plant, York, Kadoffin, Lancaster, and Cumberland.
wavs/cronkite_1979_008.wav|But the governor urged that pregnant women and young children within a five mile radius leave the area, and he closed all 23 schools there.
wavs/cronkite_1979_009.wav|About 20,000 persons live in that section, and the governor told all residents within 10 miles of the plant to stay indoors until further notice.
wavs/cronkite_1979_010.wav|Mass care centers were set up in Hershey and York, both about 15 miles from Harrisburg.
wavs/cronkite_1979_011.wav|President Carter offered federal assistance if necessary, urging officials to err on the side of caution and safety that presidents set up an emergency task force within the National Security Council.
wavs/cronkite_1979_012.wav|Gary Shepard was at the plant as the story developed.
wavs/cronkite_1979_013.wav|Late today, middle town officials declared a 9 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew.
wavs/cronkite_1979_014.wav|We'll have more on the nuclear power accident in a moment.
wavs/cronkite_1986_001.wav|even in our moment of such deep grief, we must look ahead to the future for such as the nature of life.
wavs/cronkite_1986_002.wav|There will be, of course, long investigations and examinations of what happened today at Cape Canaveral.
wavs/cronkite_1986_003.wav|The argument will be buttressed for those who have been opposed to manned space flight all along.
wavs/cronkite_1986_004.wav|They'll now add the question of safety to their arguments.
wavs/cronkite_1986_005.wav|And, of course, their engineers will have to look very carefully at what happened today to make sure that it doesn't happen again.
wavs/cronkite_1986_006.wav|Those of us who have watched the development of our space program from the very beginning, long before man first, I say a day trip into space, we saw a lot of rockets blow up on the pad, soar into space and then be destroyed.
wavs/cronkite_1986_007.wav|And I think in the backs of our minds always was locked to the fear that someday all that volatile fuel would get loose when man was aboard, as indeed happened today.
wavs/cronkite_1986_008.wav|But America's pride in what it has accomplished in space in more than a quarter of a century of safe manned flight should not be diminished by today's terrible tragedy.
wavs/cronkite_1986_009.wav|We have come a long way in space and there's still so much to be done out there.
wavs/cronkite_1986_010.wav|There are scientific, industrial, medical bounties to be reaped in space.
wavs/cronkite_1986_011.wav|To diminish what we have done in the past would be to dishonor those who lost their lives in that program on Challenger today.

wavs/cronkite_1995_002.wav|Putting new emphasis on trying to stamp out drugs right in the countries where they grow, yet all the heroin America consumes in a year can be grown on just 50 square miles, almost anywhere on earth, and that four years supply can fit in one single cargo plane.
wavs/cronkite_1995_003.wav|For every kilogram of drugs intercepted at our borders, it's estimated that at least nine kilograms get through.

wavs/cronkite_1995_006.wav|No drugs were found, please said an informant had given them bad information.
wavs/cronkite_1995_007.wav|Good evening.
wavs/cronkite_1995_008.wav|81 years ago, in 1914, America declared war on drugs, passing this nation's first law against narcotics.
wavs/cronkite_1995_009.wav|A decade ago, in response to the nations growing alarm over the rampant drug trade, President Reagan began waging that war all out at immense costs in treasure and human suffering.
wavs/cronkite_1995_010.wav|We'll ask whether this war is being won, whether indeed it can ever be won as it is now being conducted.
wavs/cronkite_1995_011.wav|And then we'll look at some alternatives.
wavs/cronkite_1995_012.wav|Alternatives cropping up here and there across the land that suggest if we can't win this war, perhaps we can find ways to peace.
wavs/cronkite_1995_013.wav|That's the subject of tonight's crime guide report, the drug dilemma.
wavs/cronkite_1995_014.wav|In the past ten years as three presidents have prosecuted their war on drugs, federal expenditures, our tax monies have shot up from a billion to a half dollars a year to almost ten times that, almost fifteen billion dollars.
wavs/cronkite_1995_015.wav|It's estimated that over those same ten years, federal, state and local governments together have spent one hundred and fifty billion of our dollars fighting drugs.
wavs/cronkite_1995_016.wav|As Americans, we've not only the right, but the duty to ask, is that money will spend?
wavs/cronkite_1995_017.wav|So our first estimate is a starting one of the two hundred and sixty million Americans now alive, seventy seven million of us, almost a third, have tried drugs at least once in our lifetimes.
wavs/cronkite_1995_018.wav|And the government estimates that almost forty million Americans continue to use drugs right now today at least once a year.
wavs/cronkite_1995_019.wav|Ten years into the old out war, America has the highest rate of drug use per capita in the industrialized world.
wavs/cronkite_1995_020.wav|There's at least some good news.
wavs/cronkite_1995_021.wav|Casual drug use, that's Americans who use narcotics irregularly every few weeks or so.
wavs/cronkite_1995_022.wav|Largely white, middle and upper-class cocaine users, has dropped steadily since 1985, from twenty-two million to around twelve million.
wavs/cronkite_1995_023.wav|That's a reduction of almost half, but the hardcore of America's drug abusers, some two point seven million people who use illicit drugs more than once a week, has remained undiminished year in, year out.
wavs/cronkite_1995_024.wav|What do we do now?
wavs/cronkite_1995_025.wav|Redouble our efforts, pour ever more billions into the war we've been fighting these past ten years, get tougher still, build more prisons?
wavs/cronkite_1995_026.wav|Before we decide, we need to know one more fact, the second highest imprisonment rate in the world, only Russia holds a larger proportion of its people in prison.
wavs/cronkite_1995_027.wav|Most of our states now put more new funds into prisons than to educating our children.
wavs/cronkite_1995_028.wav|So I visited Bedford Hills to find out what kind of women were in here and what their long imprisonment was costing them and their children and us.
