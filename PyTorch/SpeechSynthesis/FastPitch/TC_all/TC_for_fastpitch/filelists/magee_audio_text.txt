wavs/magee_1988-06-09_001.wav|I don't know until Larry Gogan's book came out the recent and very good book that he has that recording all the records and it and in the forward to that I think it it records that I was involved in the first charts.
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_002.wav|Yeah, I was always interested.
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_003.wav|I thought I mean years and years went by and there was no official chart in this country.
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_004.wav|Uh, there've been so many official and unofficial one since for that.
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_005.wav|Uh, and that was the first ever number one.
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_006.wav|The one is Pressley.
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_007.wav|Yeah, she's not here.
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_008.wav|This case you commissioned those days you commissioned yourself.
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_009.wav|Harry Thurley with whom I worked a lot.
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_010.wav|In fact, Harry used to do 185 sponsored programs a week, but he had this.
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_011.wav|He said, I convinced him he was, he was the most popular man of the day on the air, and that he should be the presenter, but how are we going to do it?
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_012.wav|And it was simply to go to the wholesalers, find out what was what was going well.
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_013.wav|Remember at this time, this is a very important point.
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_014.wav|There were no Irish records at that time.
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_015.wav|So there was nobody ringing you up at home saying, how about a plug for the sort of plug for that or no Irish records.
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_016.wav|You ring the wholesalers, check them all out, see what was selling, see what was going well.
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_017.wav|I passed it on really.
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_018.wav|And then when you got a check on what was going out of their stores, you then went to the main shops around the country.
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_019.wav|I mean 30 and 44 calls a week and got a common average around the thing and worked out the charts.
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_020.wav|And I said that the one, the the most accurate chart that has ever been.
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_021.wav|There certainly hasn't been a more accurate one I'll put it that way.
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_022.wav|May do now, but I mean at that time I'd say it had to go five six and it was before, of course, obviously earlier was before the days of the CDs.
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_023.wav|I've never seen the CD until the other day, but EPs were popular indeed at that time too.
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_024.wav|And now I see the whole thing has gone full cycle and we're back to EPs again.
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_025.wav|Yeah, I think I think he had that something special and around that time too.
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_026.wav|Or just a little later, little later than 1962, I did the first ever late night radio program on radio and when I was open every night until 12 o'clock, it used to close earlier than that, except for occasional things.
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_027.wav|But on a regular basis every Wednesday night we did the sparse sponsored program, which is a golden hour with the millionaires records that it sold a million.
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_028.wav|And that we open a regular basis until 12 o'clock and I used to play a lot of Elvis because obviously he had a lot of gold records and the Elvis Presley fan club here invited me to become the president of the Irish branch of the Elvis Presley fan club and they accepted.
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_029.wav|So I was never thrown out of office.
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_030.wav|I've received my nested very well.
wavs/magee_1988-06-09_031.wav|I remember Claude Wershius to drink with him because if it was October 1962, I was only 12 at the time.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_001.wav|well, he was because he made the decision and I think this decision in the court today can mean that he won't have to come out of retirement, won't have to come out of retirement.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_002.wav|He'll be tempted, of course, by money and by challenges.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_003.wav|Now I heard, uh, Calzagi, Joe Calzagi, issuing a challenge to him the other night and then Ben is mumbling around about coming back, uh, also you bankers in the wings, but I think Steve Collins should ignore them all.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_004.wav|Gemma is right.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_005.wav|Retire and stay retired, but this was a big fight to win because the sole little Esteem himself said on that interview that he can do, he's waiting on the judges' decision, except this time he really cannot influence them, other than as he says himself to tell the truth because it's a very tough game, boxing is in and out of the ring, but particularly in it because people who fight for a living earn the money the very hard way and winners feel pain just as much as losers.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_006.wav|Uh, it was, it was like one of these old movies, you should say, and there are more Hollywood movies made with boxing as a backdrop than any other sport.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_007.wav|And there's always the bad guys in the good ones, very clearly defined characters and little innuendos here and slights there and you wonder who's winning it.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_008.wav|It's just, it was just in fact like a fight itself, who won that round?
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_009.wav|He won that round.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_010.wav|I wonder how the judges are seeing it.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_011.wav|Then there are times to say, Collins won't win this case.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_012.wav|Then there are other times, oh yeah, he's on top now.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_013.wav|It was a bit like that.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_014.wav|I mean, it wanted to take 25 days and it took the judge two hours to read the, the judgment, the 68 page judgment.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_015.wav|That's an hour and a bit longer than an average fight.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_016.wav|No, I'm about this thing about nubbling referees and all that.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_017.wav|Now you hear all that.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_018.wav|That's, that's sort of them and run in books.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_019.wav|I have, I've been covering boxing a long time and I tell you one thing.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_020.wav|I've been sitting ringside a long time and this much I can assure you, the boxes come out of there with cuts on the rise, blood on their nose and a lot of perspiration on their bodies.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_021.wav|And for what they get for it, I know if you become a world champion like Collins, you probably are well remunerated.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_022.wav|But there are a lot of these guys fight for a couple of hundred pounds and sometimes find it hard to get it.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_023.wav|It's a very tough sport and when you hear all these far-fetch stories, I believe the far-fetched Call Man Ieeve, if you will, yes, you can have all the hullabaloo you like and all the hype.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_024.wav|It's the same with any sport.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_025.wav|Look at what soccer is going through at the moment.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_026.wav|The managers doing this, the players are doing that.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_027.wav|But when that little man with a ball comes out in the center of the field and blows us whistle or a guy with a bell rings the gong, then there are only the two teams or the two individuals concerned.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_028.wav|And you can all the inn you end up like when you see a fellow being stopped by the referee and you look at him and you look at his condition.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_029.wav|You say, good decision.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_030.wav|He's done very well in every way.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_031.wav|In 1986, he was the average amateur champion.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_032.wav|He went off to America.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_033.wav|It was a hard battle for him there.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_034.wav|He had to do it.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_035.wav|He had to work hard out of it.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_036.wav|Took the fights, won the US version of titles, then came back home, tried to establish himself in this side of Europe, did that, went for the World title, beat the unbeatable U-bank, then beat him again at Parkie Quive.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_037.wav|Where else would Collins win a fight on a choice on Cork?
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_038.wav|And then came back, beat anybody and everybody.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_039.wav|And the only, he's only lost three fights in his entire career.
wavs/magee_1998-02-03_040.wav|But the biggest one of all was this one in court and that was a victory on points, but he doesn't mind.
wavs/magee_1977-05-06_001.wav|sports stars became major entertainers and began to surround themselves with managers, promoters, and agents, and they turned a mandator price for the job.
wavs/magee_1977-05-06_002.wav|The medium which brought the performance to the public was television.
wavs/magee_1977-05-06_003.wav|Throughout the 1970s, TV and sport have shared a profitable if somewhat uncomfortable relationship in which sport has been packaged into a littering and exciting consumer product.
wavs/magee_1977-05-06_004.wav|But is it television or sport?
wavs/magee_1977-05-06_005.wav|Hundreds of millions can watch Ali and Foreman live from Zaire or Argentina, Beat Holland and the World Cup Final via satellite from Buenos Aires.
wavs/magee_1977-05-06_006.wav|But as the television audiences increase, the attendances have dropped dramatically at the events themselves.
wavs/magee_1977-05-06_007.wav|This is meant that the sports organizations have become more and more dependent on TV exposure for their revenue.
wavs/magee_1977-05-06_008.wav|The performers then become the product and demand a piece of the action.
wavs/magee_1977-05-06_009.wav|This is brought with it, Player Power, Shamamitrism and Violence.
wavs/magee_1977-05-06_010.wav|Don Atio is the author of Blood and Guts which looks at the phenomenon of violence in sport, which he argues is on the increase.
wavs/magee_1977-05-06_011.wav|With the rewards available, many sportsmen have turned to artificial methods to aid performance.
wavs/magee_1977-05-06_012.wav|One of the most serious problems of the 1970s was the increase in drug usage.
wavs/magee_1977-05-06_013.wav|First there were then fetamines, now largely eliminated by sophisticated checks.
wavs/magee_1977-05-06_014.wav|Then there were there steroids less easily detected and more recently there has been blood doping, removing, storing and re-injecting blood to improve the crucial capacity to absorb oxygen.
wavs/magee_1977-05-06_015.wav|Professor Arnold Beckett heads the International Olympic Movement's bid to stop out drug abuse.
wavs/magee_1977-05-06_016.wav|Throughout the 1970s, one of the most persistent issues in sport has been the South African policy of apartheid.
wavs/magee_1977-05-06_017.wav|As we reach the end of the decade, the arguments for and against have become more and more blurred.
wavs/magee_1977-05-06_018.wav|It's clear that some progress has been made by the South African authorities, but is the government sincere and is the progress sufficient?
wavs/magee_1977-05-06_019.wav|Have the anti-apartheid campaigners changed their ground?
wavs/magee_1977-05-06_020.wav|There are plenty of claims and counterclams, but fewer objective or dispassionate.
wavs/magee_1977-05-06_021.wav|Recently John Roder of the London Gorgeon a widely travelled sports reporter on all sports affairs visited South African.
wavs/magee_1977-05-06_022.wav|Did he think that it was becoming increasingly difficult to see the problem in terms of right or wrong?
wavs/magee_1977-05-06_023.wav|But apartheid was only one of the political issues that affected sport.
wavs/magee_1977-05-06_024.wav|On the night of the 4th of August 1972, Arab terrorists invaded the Israeli quarters in the Olympic village in Munich and took hostages, demanding the release of 200 Arab prisoners and a aircraft to fly them and their hostages to an Arab country.
wavs/magee_1977-05-06_025.wav|They threatened to kill the hostages unless their demands were met.
wavs/magee_1977-05-06_026.wav|The events culminated in a gun battle at Munich Airport and when the guns were silent, 16 people were dead.
wavs/magee_1977-05-06_027.wav|A memorial service was held in the Olympic stadium and every bronze to then President of the International Olympic Committee addressed the crowd.
wavs/magee_1977-05-06_028.wav|Four years later at Montreal, the Olympics were again the target for political protest by then Lord Kylannon has succeeded to the presidency and on his return to Dublin, he spoke to RTE.
