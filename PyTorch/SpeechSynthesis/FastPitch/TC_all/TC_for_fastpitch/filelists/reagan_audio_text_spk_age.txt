wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_001.wav|Ladies and gentlemen, I'd plan to speak to you tonight to report on the state of the union for the events of earlier today have led me to change those plans.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_002.wav|Today is a day for morning and remembering.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_003.wav|Nancy and I are paying to the Corps, but the tragedy of the Shuttle Challenger.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_004.wav|We know we share this pain with all of the people of our country.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_005.wav|This is truly a national loss.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_006.wav|19 years ago, almost of the day, we lost three astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground, but we've never lost an astronaut in flight.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_007.wav|We've never had a tragedy like this.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_010.wav|We mourn their loss as a nation together.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_012.wav|Your loved ones were daring and brave, and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says, give me a challenge and I'll meet it with joy.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_013.wav|They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_014.wav|They wished to serve and they did.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_015.wav|They served all of us.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_016.wav|We've grown used to wonders in this century.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_017.wav|It's hard to dazzle us, but for 25 years the United States space program has been doing just that.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_018.wav|We've grown used to the idea of space and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_019.wav|We're still pioneers.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_020.wav|They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_021.wav|And I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching the live coverage of the Shuttle's takeoff.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_022.wav|I know it's hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_023.wav|It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_024.wav|It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_025.wav|The future doesn't belong to the faint hearted and belongs to the brave.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_026.wav|The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future and we'll continue to follow them.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_027.wav|I've always had great faith in and respect for our space program.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_028.wav|And what happened today does nothing to diminish it.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_029.wav|We don't hide our space program.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_030.wav|We don't keep secrets and cover things up.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_031.wav|We do it all up front and didn't public.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_032.wav|That's the way freedom is and we wouldn't change it for a minute.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_033.wav|We'll continue our quest in space.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_034.wav|There would be more Shuttle flights and more Shuttle crews and yes more volunteers, more civilians, more teachers in space.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_035.wav|Nothing ends here.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_036.wav|Our hopes and our journeys continue.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_038.wav|We share it.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_039.wav|There's a coincidence today on this day 390 years ago the great explorer Sir Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_040.wav|In his lifetime the great frontiers were the oceans and historian later said he lived by the sea, died on it and was buried in it.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_041.wav|Well today we can say of the challenger crew their dedication was like drakes complete.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_042.wav|The crew of the space shuttle challenger honored us for the manner in which they lived their lives.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_044.wav|Thank you.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_001.wav|well thank you very much for that warm welcome.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_005.wav|The man to whom that mind belongs is known to you as Mr. Jefferson.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_006.wav|And I think the familiarity of that term is justified.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_007.wav|His influence here is everywhere.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_009.wav|The pursuit of science, the study of the great works, the value of free inquiry, in short the very idea of living the life of the mind.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_011.wav|The university was founding, he called a crowning achievement to a long and well-spent life.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_012.wav|Well, you're not alone in feeling his presence.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_013.wav|Presidents know about this too.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_016.wav|But it's not just students and presidents.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_017.wav|It is every American, indeed every human life ever touched with a daring idea of self-government that Mr. Jefferson has influenced.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_018.wav|Yes, Mr. Jefferson was obliged to admit all previous attempts at popular government, had proven themselves failures.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_024.wav|He had known personal tragedy, he knew how disorderly a place the world could be.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_025.wav|Indeed, as a leader of a rebellion, he was himself an architect, if you will, of disorder.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_030.wav|And I do mean personal experience.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_031.wav|You see, despite all of George Washington's warnings about the divisiveness of the partisan spirit, federalists and Republicans were constantly at each other in those days.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_032.wav|The federalists of the Northeast had held power for a long time, and were not anxious to relinquish it.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_034.wav|We too have seen a new populism in America, not at all unlike that of Jefferson's time.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_037.wav|It is this latter point that brings me to the University of Virginia today.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_038.wav|There has been much change in the last eight years in our foreign relations.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_040.wav|I will not recite all of this here again today, but I do want you to know I found in the delegates afterward a warmth that I had not seen before.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_043.wav|Only this time is not just a single nation at issue.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_044.wav|It is the whole world where popular government might flourish and prosper.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_046.wav|One of the great unnoticed and yet most startling developments of this decade is this.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_047.wav|More of the world's populace is today living in relative freedom than ever before in history.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_048.wav|More and more nations are turning to freely elected democratic governments.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_049.wav|The statistics themselves are compelling.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_052.wav|The picture is even brighter.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_053.wav|The most dramatic movement of all has taken place more than 90% of the people are now living in countries that are democratic or headed in that direction.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_054.wav|This democratic revolution has been accompanied by a change in economic thinking, comparable to the Newtonian revolution in physics.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_055.wav|That is no accident.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_056.wav|Free market economies have worked miracles in several nations of East Asia.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_057.wav|A UN General Assembly Special Session on Africa has called for more market-oriented structural reform in that region.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_061.wav|These democratic and free market revolutions are really the same revolution.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_062.wav|They are based on the vital nexus between economic and political freedom, and on the Jeffersonian idea that freedom is indivisible.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_064.wav|But if this remarkable revolution has not been obvious to many, certainly one other eye-opening change has been self-evident.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_065.wav|Consider for just a moment the sights we've seen this year.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_066.wav|An American president with a Soviet counterpart strolling through Red Square and talking to pass-or-by about war and peace.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_070.wav|But it's not the visuals and the sound bites that matter.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_071.wav|Behind all of this is a record of diplomatic movement and accomplishment.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_072.wav|One of those visuals you've seen in the last year is the signing of accords between Mr. Gorbachev and me and the destruction of American and Soviet missiles.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_073.wav|It was more than just good television, more than just action news.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_074.wav|The INF Treaty is the first accord in history to eliminate an entire class of US and Soviet nuclear missiles.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_077.wav|And so too there's progress on nuclear testing agreements and chemical weapons.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_078.wav|And we're about to begin new negotiations on the conventional balance in Europe.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_080.wav|Another area where the achievements are visible is that of regional conflicts.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_081.wav|In Afghanistan, we've seen a settlement leading towards Soviet withdrawal.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_082.wav|In Cambodia, the first steps have been taken toward withdrawal of Vietnamese troops.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_084.wav|In the matter of human rights, we've also seen extraordinary progress.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_086.wav|Some greater scope to publish and speak critically and increase in emigration and visible steps toward greater religious freedom.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_088.wav|The summits themselves are indications of the progress we've made here.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_090.wav|Where we're strong, steadfast, we succeed.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_091.wav|In the Persian Gulf, the United States made clear its commitment to defend freedom of navigation and free world interest.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_092.wav|And this helped hasten an end to the Gulf War.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_094.wav|And now that resolve has paid off.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_097.wav|Here at home a national consensus on the importance of strong American leadership is emerging.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_099.wav|Now I think much of the reason for all of this has to do with the new coherence and clarity that we brought to our foreign policy.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_101.wav|The idea of popular government has driven the revival of the West and a renewal of its values and its beliefs in itself.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_102.wav|But now the question, how do we keep the world moving toward the idea of popular government?|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_104.wav|First, the Soviet-American relationship, once marked by sterility and confrontation.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_106.wav|All of this is heady, inspiring, and yet my first reflection for you today is, all of it is still in doubt.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_107.wav|And the only way to make it last and grow and become permanent is to remember we're not there yet.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_108.wav|Serious problems, fundamental differences remain.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_109.wav|Our system is one of checks and balances.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_110.wav|There's for all its reforms remains a one-party authoritarian system that institutionalizes the concentration of power.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_111.wav|Our foreign relations embrace this expanding world of democracy that I've described.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_112.wav|There's can be known by the company they keep.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_113.wav|Cuba, Nicaragua, Ethiopia, Libya, Vietnam, North Korea.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_115.wav|So we must keep our heads, and that means keeping our skepticism.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_117.wav|So this means in our treaty negotiations, as I've said, trust but verify.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_118.wav|I'm not a linguist, but I learned to say that much Russian and have used it in frequent meetings with Mr. Gorbachev.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_119.wav|Dover-Yai, no prover-Yai.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_120.wav|It means keeping our military strong.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_121.wav|It remains remembering no treaty is better than a bad treaty.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_122.wav|It means remembering the accords of Moscow and Washington summits followed many years of standing firm on our principles and our interests and those of our allies.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_124.wav|We must never do that again.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_125.wav|It's not an act of belligerence to speak to the fundamental differences between totalitarianism and democracy.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_126.wav|It's a moral imperative.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_127.wav|It doesn't slow down the pace of negotiations.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_128.wav|It moves them forward.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_130.wav|A second reflection I have on all this concerns some recent speculation that what is happening in the Soviet Union was in its way inevitable.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_131.wav|But since the death of Stalin, the Soviet state would have to evolve into a more moderate and status quo power in accordance with some vague theory of convergence.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_132.wav|I think this is wrong.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_133.wav|It's also dangerous because what we see in the Soviet Union today is a change of a different order than in the past.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_135.wav|We also saw the construction of the Berlin Wall.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_137.wav|And let me assure you, Mr. cruise chief gave no speeches at the UN like that recently given by Mr. Gorbachev.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_139.wav|We know to what happened in the Brezhnev era greater and greater expansionism, Afghanistan, economic decay and overwhelming corruption.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_140.wav|A greater and greater burden on the peoples of the Soviet Union, on all the peoples of the world.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_141.wav|Now this is changing.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_142.wav|How much and how fast it will change we do not know.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_145.wav|As I suggested in 1982, if the West maintained its strength, we would see economic needs clash with the political order in the Soviet Union.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_146.wav|This has happened, but it could not have happened if the West had not maintained, indeed strengthened its will, its commitment to world freedom.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_147.wav|So there was nothing inevitable about all of this.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_148.wav|Human actions made the difference.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_149.wav|Mr. Gorbachev has taken some daring steps.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_150.wav|As I said before, this is the first Soviet leader, not to make world revolution a priority.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_151.wav|Well, let us credit those steps, let us credit him.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_152.wav|What happens in the next few years, whether all this progress is continued or ended, this is in large part up to us.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_153.wav|It's why now more than ever we must not falter.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_154.wav|American power must be exercised morally, of course, but it must also be exercised and exercised effectively.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_155.wav|For the cause of peace and freedom in the 80s, that power made all the difference.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_156.wav|The 90s will prove no different, and this brings us to my third point.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_157.wav|The relationship between the executive and the Congress.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_159.wav|Precisely there, our policies have succeeded and we see progress.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_161.wav|Congress on again, off again, indecisiveness on resisting sand and east atirany and aggression, has left Central America a region of continuing danger.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_162.wav|Sometimes, congressional actions in foreign affairs have had the effect of institutionalizing that kind of adversarial relationship.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_163.wav|We see it in the war powers resolution.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_164.wav|In the attempted restrictions on the President's power to implement treaties and untrade policy.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_166.wav|Even in arms reduction, a President's ability to succeed depends on congressional support for military modernization.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_167.wav|Sometimes attempts are made to weaken my hand.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_168.wav|The founding fathers understood the need for effectiveness, coherence, consistency, and flexibility in the conduct of foreign affairs.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_169.wav|As Jefferson himself said, the transaction of business with foreign nations is executive altogether.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_170.wav|It belongs then to the head of that department, except as to such portions of it as are specially submitted to the Senate.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_171.wav|Exceptions are to be construed strictly.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_172.wav|For the President and the Vice President are elected by all the people.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_173.wav|So too is the Congress as a collegial body.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_175.wav|To this, this foremost, they must always be attended.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_176.wav|For a President, it means protecting his office and its place in our constitutional framework.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_177.wav|In doing that, the President is accountable, accountable to the people in the most direct way, accountable to history, and to his own conscience.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_178.wav|The President and Congress, to be sure, share many responsibilities, but their roles are not the same.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_179.wav|Congress alone, for example, has the power of purse.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_180.wav|The President is chief executive, chief diplomat, and commander-in-chief.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_181.wav|How these great branches of government perform their legitimate roles is critically important to the nation's ability to succeed.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_182.wav|Nowhere more so than in the field of foreign affairs.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_183.wav|They need each other and must work together in common cause with all deference but within their separate spheres.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_185.wav|In such a world, more than ever, America needs strong and consistent leadership and the strength and resilience of the presidency are vital.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_187.wav|All of us know the terribly importance of maintaining the progress we've made in the decade of the 80s.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_188.wav|We're moving away from war and confrontation toward peace and freedom, and today toward a future beyond the imaginings of the past.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_189.wav|These are the stakes.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_190.wav|Some may find such prospects daunting.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_191.wav|I think you should find them challenging and exciting, and I think you can see that in all of this and you and your country will have a special role to play.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_192.wav|The issue before the world is still the same as the one that Jefferson faced so squarely and so memorably.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_193.wav|Can human beings manage their own affairs?|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_194.wav|Your self-determination and popular representative government possible.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_198.wav|Letters that discussed almost every conceivable subject, gardening, horseback riding, even sneezing as a cure for hiccups.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_200.wav|It carries me back.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_201.wav|Jefferson wrote about his correspondence with his co-signer of the Declaration of Independence.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_203.wav|It was their last gift to us, this lesson intolerance for each other, in charity, this insight into America's strength as a nation.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_205.wav|A great future is ours, and the worlds, if we but remember the power of those words.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_207.wav|Thank you, God bless you.|1|77

wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_019.wav|In the other it points toward Brussels, headquarters of Western Europe's tangible unity.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_020.wav|The marker says that the distances from Warsaw to Moscow and Warsaw to Brussels are equal.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_021.wav|The sign makes this point Poland is not east or west, Poland is at the center of European civilization.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_022.wav|It is contributed mightily to that civilization.|1|71

wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_024.wav|Poland's struggle to be Poland and to secure the basic rights we often take for granted demonstrates why we dare not take those rights for granted.|1|71

wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_027.wav|It was easier to believe in the march of democracy in Gladstone's day in that high noon of Victorian optimism.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_028.wav|We're approaching the end of a bloody century plagued by a terrible political invention totalitarianism.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_030.wav|Yet optimism is in order because day by day democracy is proving itself to be a not at all fragile flower.|1|71

wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_038.wav|Well, not always patient.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_039.wav|I do recall that on one occasion Sir Winston Churchill said an exasperation about one of our most distinguished diplomats.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_040.wav|He is the only case I know of a bull who carries his china shop with him.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_041.wav|Woody, as Sir Winston was, he also had that special attribute of great statesman, the gift of vision.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_042.wav|The willingness to see the future based on the experience of the past.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_044.wav|We have not inherited an easy world.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_046.wav|There are threats now to our freedom, indeed to our very existence, that other generations could never even have imagined.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_047.wav|There is first the threat of global war.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_048.wav|No president, no congress, no prime minister, no parliament can spend a day entirely free of this threat.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_052.wav|At the same time there is a threat posed to human freedom by the enormous power of the modern state.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_053.wav|History teaches the dangers of government that overreaches.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_056.wav|But on one point all of us are united.|1|71

wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_059.wav|Historians looking back at our time will note the consistent restraint and peaceful intentions of the west.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_061.wav|Had that nuclear monopoly been in the hands of the communist world, the map of Europe indeed the world would look very different today.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_063.wav|If history teaches anything it teaches self delusion in the face of unpleasant facts is folly.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_066.wav|What then is our course?|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_067.wav|Must civilization perish in a hail of fiery atoms?|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_068.wav|Must freedom wither and acquire a deadening accommodation with totalitarian evil?|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_069.wav|Sir Winston Churchill refused to accept the inevitability of war or even that it was imminent.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_070.wav|He said,|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_073.wav|Well this is precisely our mission today to preserve freedom as well as peace.|1|71

wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_075.wav|In an ironic sense Karl Marx was right.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_076.wav|We are witnessing today a great revolutionary crisis.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_077.wav|A crisis where the demands of the economic order are conflicting directly with those of the political order.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_079.wav|It is the Soviet Union that runs against the tide of history by denying human freedom and human dignity to its citizens.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_080.wav|It also is in deep economic difficulty.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_081.wav|The rate of growth in the national product has been steadily declining since the 50s and is less than half of what it was then.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_082.wav|The dimensions of this failure are astounding, a country which employs one-fifth of its population and agriculture is unable to feed its own people.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_083.wav|We're at not for the private sector, the tiny private sector tolerated in Soviet agriculture, the country might be on the brink of famine.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_085.wav|Overcentralized with little or no incentives year after year, the Soviet system pours its best resource into the making of instruments of destruction.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_086.wav|The constant shrinkage of economic growth combined with the growth of military production is putting a heavy strain on the Soviet people.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_088.wav|The decay of the Soviet experiment should come as no surprise to us.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_091.wav|Today on the NATO line, our military forces face East to prevent a possible invasion.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_092.wav|On the other side of the line, the Soviet forces also face East, to prevent their people from leaving.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_093.wav|The hard evidence of totalitarian rule is caused in mankind and uprising of the intellect and will.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_096.wav|More recently, we've seen evidence of this same human impulse in one of the developing nations in Central America.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_097.wav|For months and months, the world news media covered the fighting in El Salvador.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_099.wav|And then one day, those silent, suffering people were offered a chance to vote, to choose the kind of government they wanted.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_100.wav|Suddenly, the freedom fighters in the hills were exposed for what they really are.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_101.wav|Cuban backed guerrillas who want power for themselves and their backers, not democracy for the people.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_102.wav|They threatened death to any who voted and destroyed hundreds of buses and trucks to keep the people from getting to the polling places.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_104.wav|They stood for hours in the hot sun, waiting for their turn to vote.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_106.wav|A grandmother who had been told with the guerrillas she would be killed when she returned from the polls.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_107.wav|And she told the guerrillas, you can kill me, you can kill my family, kill my neighbors, but you can't kill us all.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_108.wav|The real freedom fighters of El Salvador turned out to be the people of that country, the young, the old, the in between.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_109.wav|Strange, but my own country, there's been little if any news coverage of that war since the election.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_110.wav|Now, perhaps they'll say it's well because there aren't newer struggles now distant islands in the South Atlantic.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_111.wav|Young men are fighting for Britain.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_113.wav|If there had been firmer support for that principle some 45 years ago, perhaps our generation wouldn't have suffered the bloodletting of World War II.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_115.wav|The fighting in Lebanon and the part of all parties must stop, and Israel should bring its forces home.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_116.wav|But this is not enough.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_117.wav|We must all work to stamp out the scourge of terrorism that in the Middle East makes war an ever-present threat.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_118.wav|But beyond the trouble spots lies a deeper, more positive pattern.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_119.wav|Around the world today, the Democratic revolution is gathering new strength.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_120.wav|In India, a critical test has been passed with the peaceful change of governing political parties.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_121.wav|In African Nigeria is moving into remarkable and unmistakable ways to build and strengthen its democratic institutions.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_123.wav|In the communist world as well, man's instinctive desire for freedom and self-determination surfaces again and again.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_125.wav|But the struggle continues in Poland.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_126.wav|And we know that there are even those who strive and suffer for freedom within the confines of the Soviet Union itself.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_127.wav|How we conduct ourselves here in the Western democracies will determine whether this trend continues.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_128.wav|No democracy is not a fragile flower.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_129.wav|Still, it needs cultivating.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_131.wav|Some argue that we should encourage democratic change in right-wing dictatorships, but not in communist regimes.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_133.wav|We reject this course.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_136.wav|We ask only for a process, a direction, a basic code of decency, not for an instant transformation.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_137.wav|We cannot ignore the fact that even without our encouragement, there has been and will continue to be repeated explosions against repression and dictatorships.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_138.wav|The Soviet Union itself is not immune to this reality.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_139.wav|Any system is inherently unstable that has no peaceful means to legitimize its leaders.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_140.wav|In such cases, the very repressiveness of the state ultimately drives people to resist it, if necessary, by force.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_143.wav|So states the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which among other things guarantees free elections.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_144.wav|The objective I propose is quite simple to state.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_146.wav|This is not cultural imperialism, it is providing the means for genuine self-determination and protection for diversity.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_147.wav|Democracy already flourishes in countries with very different cultures and historical experiences.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_148.wav|It would be cultural condescension or worse to say that any people preferred dictatorship to democracy.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_149.wav|Who would voluntarily choose not to have the right to vote?|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_150.wav|Decide to purchase government propaganda handouts instead of independent newspapers.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_151.wav|Prefer government to work or control unions.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_152.wav|Opt for land to be owned by the state instead of those who tell it.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_154.wav|Since 1917, the Soviet Union has given covert political trading and assistance to Marxist Leninists in many countries.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_155.wav|Of course, it also has promoted the use of violence and subversion by these same forces.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_157.wav|The Federal Republic of Germany's political foundations have become a major force in this effort.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_158.wav|We in America now intend to take additional steps as many of our allies have already done toward realizing this same goal.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_160.wav|They will have the cooperation of congressional leaders of both parties, along with representatives of business, labor and other major institutions in our society.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_162.wav|It is time that we committed ourselves as a nation in both the public and private sectors to assisting democratic development.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_163.wav|We plan to consult with leaders of other nations as well.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_164.wav|There is a proposal before the Council of Europe to invite parliamentarians from democratic countries to a meeting next year in Strasbourg.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_165.wav|That prestigious gathering could consider ways to help democratic political movements.|1|71

wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_167.wav|In the next spring there will be a conference of world authorities on constitutionalism and self-government hosted by the Chief Justice of the United States.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_171.wav|Now, I don't wish to sound overly optimistic, yet the Soviet Union is not immune from the reality of what is going on in the world.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_173.wav|It begins to allow its people a voice in their own destiny.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_179.wav|For the ultimate determined in the struggle is not going that's now going on in the world.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_180.wav|Will not be bombs and rockets, but a test of wills and ideas.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_181.wav|A trial the ideals to which we are dedicated.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_183.wav|Here among you is the cradle of self-government, the mother of parliament.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_184.wav|Here is the enduring greatness of the British contribution to mankind.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_185.wav|The great civilized ideas, individual liberty, representative government, and the rule of law under God.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_187.wav|This reluctance to use those vast resources that our command reminds me of the elderly lady whose home was bombed in the blitz.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_188.wav|As the rescuers moved about, they found a bottle of brandy she'd stored behind the staircase, which was all that was left standing.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_189.wav|And since she was barely conscious, one of the workers pulled the cork to give her a taste of it.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_190.wav|She came around immediately and said here, and there, now put it back.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_191.wav|That's for emergencies.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_192.wav|Well, the emergency is upon us.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_193.wav|Let us be shy no longer.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_194.wav|Let us go to our strength.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_195.wav|Let us offer hope.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_196.wav|Let us tell the world that a new age is not only possible, but probable.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_198.wav|What kind of a people do they think we are?|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_199.wav|Well, Britain's adversaries found out what extraordinary people the British are.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_200.wav|But all the democracies paid a terrible price for allowing the dictators to underestimate us.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_201.wav|We dare not make that mistake again.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_202.wav|So let us ask ourselves, what kind of people do we think we are?|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_204.wav|Sir Winston led his people to great victory and war, and then lost an election just as the fruits of victory were about to be enjoyed.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_206.wav|History recalls his greatness in ways no dictator will ever know.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_209.wav|We have, he said, come safely through the worst.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_210.wav|Well, the task I've set forth will long outlive our own generation.|1|71

wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_009.wav|I am pleased to report the state of our union is stronger than a year ago and growing stronger each day.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_010.wav|United in spirit, powerful in pride and patriotism.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_011.wav|America is on the move.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_012.wav|But it wasn't long ago that we looked out on a different land.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_013.wav|Locked factory gates, long gasoline lines, intolerable prices and interest rates turning the greatest country on Earth into a land of broken dreams.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_014.wav|Government growing beyond our consent had become a lumbering giant, slamming shut the gates of opportunity, threatening to crush the very roots of our freedom.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_015.wav|What brought America back?|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_016.wav|The American people brought us back.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_017.wav|The future will be ours for the future belongs to the free.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_020.wav|And despite the pressures of our modern world, family and community remain the moral core of our society.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_021.wav|Guardians of our values and hopes for the future.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_022.wav|Family and community are the co-stars of this great American comeback.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_023.wav|They are why we say tonight, private values must be at the heart of public policies.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_024.wav|What is true for families in America is true for America in the family of free nations.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_025.wav|History is no captive of some inevitable force.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_026.wav|History is made by men and women of vision and courage.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_027.wav|Tonight freedom is on the march.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_028.wav|The United States is the economic miracle, the model to which the world once again turns.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_030.wav|Teddy Roosevelt said that a nation that does great work lives forever.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_031.wav|We have done well, but we cannot stop at the foothills when Everest beckons.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_032.wav|It's time for America to be all that we can be.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_033.wav|We speak tonight of an agenda for the future, an agenda for a safer, more secure world.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_034.wav|And we speak about the necessity for actions to steal us for the challenges of growth, trade and security in the next decade and the year 2000.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_036.wav|This week I will send you our detailed proposals.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_037.wav|Tonight let us speak of our responsibility to redefine government's role.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_039.wav|But we cannot win the race to the future, shackle to a system that can't even pass a federal budget.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_040.wav|We cannot win that race held back by horse and buggy programs that waste tax dollars and squander human potential.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_041.wav|We cannot win that race if we're swamped in a sea of red ink.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_042.wav|Now Mr. Speaker, you know I know when the American people know the federal budget system is broken.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_043.wav|It doesn't work.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_044.wav|Before we leave this city, let you and I work together to fix it.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_045.wav|Passage of Graham Rudman|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_046.wav|Hollings gives us an historic opportunity to achieve what has eluded our national leadership for decades, forcing the federal government to live within its means.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_047.wav|Your schedule now requires that the budget resolution be passed by April 15th.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_048.wav|The very day America's families have to foot the bill for the budgets that you produce.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_049.wav|How often we read of a husband and wife, both working, struggling from paycheck to paycheck, to raise a family, meet them or each pay their taxes and bills.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_050.wav|And yet some in Congress say taxes must be raised.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_051.wav|Well, I'm sorry.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_052.wav|They're asking the wrong people to tighten their belts.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_053.wav|We do not face large deficits because American families are under taxed.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_054.wav|We face those deficits because the federal government overspends.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_055.wav|That he tailed budget that we will submit.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_056.wav|We'll meet the Graham Rudman Hollings target for deficit reductions.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_057.wav|Meet our commitment to ensure a strong national defense.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_058.wav|Meet our commitment to protect social security and the truly less fortunate.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_059.wav|And yes, meet our commitment to not raise taxes.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_060.wav|Well, not by taking from those in need.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_061.wav|As families take care of their own, government must provide shelter and nourishment for those who cannot provide for themselves.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_063.wav|Graham Rudman Hollings can mark a dramatic improvement.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_064.wav|But experience shows that simply setting deficit targets does not assure they'll be met.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_065.wav|We must proceed with grace commission reforms against waste.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_066.wav|And tonight I ask you to give me what 43 governors already have.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_067.wav|Give me a line item veto this year.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_068.wav|I'll take the heat.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_069.wav|This authority would not give me any monopoly power, but simply prevent spending measures from sneaking through that could not pass on their own merit.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_070.wav|And you can sustain or override my veto.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_071.wav|That's the way the system should work.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_072.wav|Once we've made the hard choices, we should lock in our gains.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_073.wav|We must meet it.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_074.wav|Defense is not just another budget expense.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_075.wav|Keeping America strong, free, and at peace is solely the responsibility of the federal government.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_076.wav|It is government's prime responsibility.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_077.wav|We have devoted five years trying to narrow a dangerous gap, born of illusion and neglect.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_078.wav|And we've made important gains.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_080.wav|This is reality.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_081.wav|Closing our eyes will not make reality disappear.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_082.wav|We pledged together to hold real growth and defense spending to the bare minimum.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_083.wav|My budget honors that pledge.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_084.wav|And I'm now asking you, the Congress, to keep its end to the bargain.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_085.wav|The Soviets must know that if America reduces her defenses, it will be because of a reduced threat, not a reduced resolve.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_086.wav|But as I've said before, the most powerful force we can enlist against the federal deficit is an ever-expanding American economy unfettered and free.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_087.wav|A magic of opportunity, unreserved unfailing, unrestrained.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_088.wav|Isn't this the calling that unites us?|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_091.wav|But no more.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_092.wav|We've come this far.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_093.wav|We cannot and we will not accept tax reform that is a tax increase in disguise.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_094.wav|True reform must be an engine of productivity and growth, and that means a top personal rate.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_095.wav|No higher than 35 percent.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_096.wav|True reform must be truly fair, and that means raising personal exemptions to $2,000.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_097.wav|True reform means a tax system that at a long last is pro-family, pro-jobs, pro-future, and pro-America.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_098.wav|We have already taken actions to counter unfair trading practices to pry open closed foreign markets.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_099.wav|We will continue to do so.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_102.wav|We must never again permit wild currency swings to cripple our farmers and other exporters.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_103.wav|Farmers in particular have suffered from past unwise government policies.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_104.wav|They must not be abandoned with problems they did not create and cannot control.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_105.wav|We've begun coordinating economic and monetary policy among our major trading partners, but there's more to do.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_107.wav|Americans are striding forward to embrace the future.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_109.wav|We see it in the Renaissance in education, the rising SAT scores for three years.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_110.wav|Last years increased the greatest since 1963.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_111.wav|It wasn't government in Washington lobbies that turned education around.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_112.wav|It was the American people who in reaching for excellence knew to reach back to basics.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_114.wav|Yet today there is a wound in our national conscience.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_115.wav|America will never be whole as long as the right to life granted by our creator is denied to the unborn.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_116.wav|For the rest of my time I shall do what I can to see.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_117.wav|We must also look to the condition of America's families.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_118.wav|Struggling parents today worry how they will provide their children the advantages that their parents gave them.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_119.wav|In the welfare culture, the breakdown of the family, the most basic support system, has reached crisis proportions.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_120.wav|In female and child poverty, child abandonment, horrible crimes, and deteriorating schools.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_121.wav|After hundreds of billions of dollars in poverty programs, the plight of the poor grows more painful.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_122.wav|But the waste in dollars and cents pales before the most tragic loss, the sinful waste of human spirit and potential.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_123.wav|We can ignore this terrible truth no longer.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_125.wav|And we must now escape the spider's web of dependency.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_128.wav|After seeing how devastating illness can destroy the financial security of a family, I am directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Oda's Bowen.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_130.wav|And tonight I want to speak directly to America's younger generation because you hold the destiny of our nation in your hands.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_131.wav|With all the temptations young people face, it sometimes seems the allure of the permissive society requires superhuman feats of self-control.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_132.wav|But the call of the future is too strong.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_133.wav|A challenge too great to get lost in the blind alleyways of dissolution, drugs, and despair.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_134.wav|Never has there been a more exciting time to be alive.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_135.wav|A time of browsing wonder in heroic achievement as they said in the film back to the future, where we're going, we don't need roads.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_136.wav|What today physicists, peering into the infinitely small realms of subatomic particles, find reaffirmations of religious faith.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_137.wav|Astronomers build a space telescope that conceded the edge of the universe and possibly back to the moment of creation.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_138.wav|So yes, this nation remains fully committed to America's space program.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_139.wav|We're going forward with our shuttle flights.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_140.wav|We're going forward to build our space station.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_142.wav|And free mankind from the prison of nuclear terror.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_143.wav|Now America must meet another to make our strategic defense real for all the citizens of planet Earth.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_144.wav|Let us speak of our deepest longing for the future to leave our children a land that is free and just in a world at peace.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_145.wav|It's my hope that our firesides summit in Geneva, Mr. Gorbachev's lead to a more stable relationship.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_146.wav|Surely no people on Earth hate war or love peace more than we Americans.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_149.wav|Our negotiators in Geneva have proposed a radical cut and offensive forces by each side with no cheating.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_150.wav|They have made clear that Soviet compliance with the letter of the spirit of agreements is essential.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_151.wav|If the Soviet government wants an agreement that truly reduces nuclear arms, there will be such an agreement.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_152.wav|We know that peace follows in freedom's path and conflicts erupt when the will of the people is denied.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_154.wav|Free your markets, sound currencies around the world.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_157.wav|We say to you tonight, you are not alone freedom fighters, America will support you with moral and material assistance.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_159.wav|This year I will be asking Congress for the means to do what must be done for the great and good cause.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_161.wav|Indeed for the remainder of the century.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_162.wav|After all, we've done so far, let no one say that this nation cannot reach the destiny of our dreams.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_163.wav|America believes America is ready.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_164.wav|America can win the race to the future and we shall.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_165.wav|The American dream is a song of hope that rings through night-winter air, vivid tender music that warms our hearts when the least among us aspire to the greatest things.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_167.wav|We see the dream coming true in the spirit of discovery of Richard Cavoli.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_168.wav|All his life he's been enthralled by the mysteries of medicine.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_170.wav|We see the dream glow in the towering talent of a 12-year-old to long-forward.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_171.wav|A child prodigy of gospel music, he has surmounted personal adversity to become an accomplished pianist and singer.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_172.wav|He also directs the choirs of three churches and is performed at the Kennedy Center.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_173.wav|With God as your composer to own your music will be the music of angels.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_174.wav|We see the dream being saved by the courage of a 13-year-old Shelby butler, honor student and member of her school's safety patrol.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_175.wav|Seeing another girl freeze in terror before and out of controlled school bus, she risked her life and pulled her to safety.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_176.wav|With braver like you or Shelby, America need never fear for our future.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_177.wav|And we see the dream born again in the joyful compassion of a 13-year-old Trevor Ferrell.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_178.wav|Two years ago, age 11, watching men and women bedding down in abandoned doorways on television you.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_180.wav|Trevor left his suburban Philadelphia home to bring blankets and food to the helpless and homeless.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_181.wav|And now, 250 people help him fulfill his nightly vigil.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_182.wav|Trevor's yours is the living spirit of brotherly love.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_185.wav|You are heroes of our hearts.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_186.wav|We look at you and know it's true in this land of dreams fulfilled where greater dreams may be imagined.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_187.wav|Nothing is impossible.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_188.wav|No victory is beyond our reach.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_189.wav|No glory will ever be too great.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_191.wav|The world's hopes rest with America's future.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_192.wav|America's hopes rest with us.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_193.wav|So let us go forward to create our world of tomorrow in faith, in unity, and in love.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_194.wav|God bless you and God bless America.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_001.wav|good evening.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_003.wav|This final home, the people's house has seen so much, in so much a part of all our lives in history.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_004.wav|It's been humbling and inspiring for Nancy and me to be spending our first Christmas in this place.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_005.wav|We've lived here as your tenants for almost a year now, and what a year it's been.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_006.wav|As a people we've been through quite a lot, moments of joy, tragedy, and of real achievement, moments that I believe have brought us all closer together.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_007.wav|GK Chesterden once said that the world would never starve for wonders, but only for the want of wonder.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_008.wav|At this special time of year we all renew our sense of wonder in recalling the story of the first Christmas in Bethlehem nearly two thousand years ago.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_009.wav|Some celebrate Christmas as the birthday of a great and good philosopher and teacher.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_010.wav|Others of us believe in the divinity of the child born in Bethlehem, but he was and is the promised Prince of Peace.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_012.wav|Tonight in millions of American homes the glow of the Christmas tree is a reflection of the love Jesus taught us.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_013.wav|Like the shepherds and wise men of that first Christmas, we Americans have always tried to follow a higher light, a star if you will.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_015.wav|At times our footsteps may have floated, but trusting in God's help we've never lost our way.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_017.wav|Like the National Christmas tree, our country is a living, growing thing planted in rich American soil.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_018.wav|Only our devoted care can bring it to full flower.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_019.wav|So let this holiday season be for us a time of rededication.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_020.wav|Even as we rejoice, however, let us remember that for some Americans this will not be as happy a Christmas as it should be.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_021.wav|I know a little of what they feel.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_022.wav|I remember one Christmas Eve during the Great Depression.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_023.wav|My father, opening what he thought was a Christmas greeting.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_024.wav|It was a notice that he no longer had a job.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_025.wav|Over the past year we'd begun a long hard work of economic recovery.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_026.wav|Our goal is in America in which every citizen who needs and wants a job can get a job.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_027.wav|Our program for recovery has only been in place for 12 weeks now, but it is beginning to work.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_028.wav|With your help and prayers, it will succeed.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_031.wav|We were living, he said, in the best of times and the worst of times.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_032.wav|But in some ways that's even more true today.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_033.wav|The world is full of peril as well as promise.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_034.wav|Too many of its people, even now, live in the shadow of want and tyranny.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_035.wav|As I speak to you tonight, the fate of a proud and ancient nation hangs in the balance.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_036.wav|For a thousand years, Christmas has been celebrated in Poland, a land of deep religious faith.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_037.wav|But this Christmas brings little joy to the courageous Polish people.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_038.wav|They have been betrayed by their own government.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_039.wav|The men who rule them and their totalitarian allies fear the very freedom that the Polish people cherish.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_040.wav|They have answered the stirrings of liberty with brute force, killings, mass arrests, and the setting up of concentration camps.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_041.wav|Like Wollessa and other solidarity leaders are imprisoned, their fate unknown.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_042.wav|Factories, minds, universities, and homes have been assaulted.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_043.wav|The Polish government has trampled underfoot solemn commitments to the UN Charter and the Helsinki Accords.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_048.wav|The target of this depression is the solidarity movement, but in attacking solidarity is enemies attack an entire people.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_049.wav|Ten million of Poland's 36 million citizens are members of solidarity taken together with their families.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_050.wav|They account for the overwhelming majority of the Polish nation.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_051.wav|By persecuting solidarity, the Polish government wages war against its own people.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_052.wav|I urge the Polish government and its allies to consider the consequences of their actions.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_053.wav|How can they possibly justify using naked force to crush a people who ask for nothing more than the right to lead their own lives in freedom and dignity?|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_054.wav|Roof force may intimidate, but it cannot form the basis of an enduring society, and the alien Polish economy cannot be rebuilt with terror tactics.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_055.wav|Poland needs cooperation between its government and its people, not military oppression.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_058.wav|But at the forces of tyranny and Poland, and those who incite them from without do not relent, they should prepare themselves for serious consequences.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_059.wav|Already, throughout the free world, citizens have publicly demonstrated their support for the Polish people.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_060.wav|Our government and those of our allies have expressed moral revulsion at the police state tactics of Poland's oppressors.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_061.wav|The Church has also spoken out in spite of threats and intimidation, but our reaction cannot stop there.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_063.wav|Make no mistake, their crime will cost them dearly in their future dealings with America and free peoples everywhere.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_064.wav|I do not make this statement lightly or without serious reflection.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_065.wav|We have been measured and deliberating in our reaction to the tragic events in Poland.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_066.wav|We have not acted in haste, and the steps I will outline tonight and others we may take in the days ahead are firm, just and reasonable.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_068.wav|The neighboring country of Austria has opened her doors to refugees from Poland.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_069.wav|I have therefore directed that American assistance including supplies of basic food and stuff, they offered to aid the Austrians in providing for these refugees.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_072.wav|We must be sure that every bit of food provided by America goes to the Polish people, not to their oppressors.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_073.wav|The United States is taking immediate action to suspend major elements of our economic relationships with the Polish government.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_074.wav|We have halted the renewal of the Export-Import Banks line of export credit insurance to the Polish government.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_075.wav|We will suspend Polish civil aviation privileges in the United States.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_076.wav|We are suspending the right of Poland's fishing fleet to operate in American waters.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_077.wav|And we are proposing to our allies the further restriction of high technology exports to Poland.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_078.wav|These actions are not directed against the Polish people.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_079.wav|They are a warning to the government of Poland that free men cannot and will not stand idly by in the face of brutal repression.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_080.wav|To underscore this point, I have written a letter to General Yarosłicki, head of the Polish government.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_081.wav|In it, I outline the steps we are taking and warned of the serious consequences if the Polish government continues to use violence against his populace.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_083.wav|The Soviet Union, through its threats and pressures, deserves a major share of blame for the developments in Poland.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_084.wav|So I have also sent a letter to President Brezhnev urging him to permit the restoration of basic human rights in Poland, provided for in the Helsinki Final Act.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_087.wav|There is a spirit of solidarity abroad in the world tonight that no physical force can crush.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_088.wav|It crosses national boundaries and enters into the hearts of men and women everywhere.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_089.wav|In factories, farms and schools, in cities and towns around the globe, we, the people of the free world, stand as one with our Polish brothers and sisters.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_090.wav|Their cause is ours and our prayers and hopes go out to them this Christmas.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_095.wav|Once, earlier in this century, an evil influence threatened that the lights were going out all over the world.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_096.wav|Let the light of millions of candles in American homes give notice that the light of freedom is not going to be extinguished.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_097.wav|We are blessed with a freedom and abundance denied to so many.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_100.wav|In their love and laughter, in our hopes for their future lies the true meaning of Christmas.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_102.wav|As Charles Dickens, whom I quoted a few moments ago said so well in a Christmas carol, God bless us everyone.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_001.wav|this morning at 7 a.m., the union representing those who man America's air traffic control facilities called a strike.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_002.wav|This was the culmination of seven months of negotiations between the federal aviation administration and the union.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_003.wav|At one point in these negotiations, agreement was reached and signed by both sides, granting a $40 million increase in salaries and benefits.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_004.wav|This is twice what other government employees can expect.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_005.wav|It was granted in recognition of the difficulties inherent in the work these people perform.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_006.wav|Now however, the union demands are 17 times what had been agreed to $681 million.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_007.wav|This would impose a tax burden on their federal citizens which is unacceptable.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_008.wav|I would like to thank the supervisors and controllers who are on the job today helping to get the nation's air system operating safely.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_009.wav|In the New York area for example, four supervisors were scheduled to report for work and 17 additionally volunteered.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_011.wav|This is a great tribute to America.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_012.wav|Let me make one thing plain.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_013.wav|I respect the right of workers in the private sector to strike.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_014.wav|Indeed, as president of my own union, I led the first strike ever called by that union.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_015.wav|I guess I'm maybe the first one to ever hold this office who is a lifetime member of an AF of LCIO union.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_016.wav|But we cannot compare labor management relations in the private sector with government.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_017.wav|Government cannot close down the assembly line.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_018.wav|It has to provide without interruption the protective services which are government's reason for being.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_019.wav|It was in recognition of this that the Congress passed a law forbidding strikes by government employees against the public safety.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_020.wav|Let me read the solemn oath taken by each of these employees, Miss Warren-Affed David, when they accepted their jobs.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_022.wav|It is for this reason that I must tell those who failed a report for duty this morning.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_024.wav|End of statement.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_001.wav|I've spoken to you from this historic office on many occasions and about many things.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_002.wav|The power of the presidency is often thought to reside within this oval office.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_003.wav|Yet it doesn't rest here.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_004.wav|It rests in you, the American people, and in your trust.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_005.wav|Your trust is what gives the president his powers of leadership and his personal strength, and it's what I want to talk to you about this evening.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_006.wav|For the past three months, I've been silent on the revelations about Iran, and you must have been thinking, well, why doesn't he tell us what's happening?|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_007.wav|Why doesn't he just speak to us as he has in the past when we've faced troubles or tragedies?|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_008.wav|Others of you, I guess, were thinking, what's he doing, hiding out in the White House?|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_009.wav|Well, the reason I haven't spoken to you before now is this.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_011.wav|There's been enough of that.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_012.wav|I paid a price for my silence in terms of your trust and confidence, but I've had to wait as you have for the complete story.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_014.wav|It has now issued its findings.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_015.wav|I'm often accused of being an optimist, and it's true I had to hunt pretty hard to find any good news in the Board's report.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_016.wav|As you know, it's well stocked with criticisms, which I'll discuss in a moment, but I was very relieved to read this sentence.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_019.wav|They have done the nation, as well as me personally, a great service by submitting a report of such integrity and depth.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_020.wav|They have my genuine and enduring gratitude.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_021.wav|I've studied the Board's report, its findings are honest, convincing, and highly critical, and I accept them.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_022.wav|And tonight, I want to share with you my thoughts on these findings, and report to you on the actions I'm taking to implement the Board's recommendations.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_023.wav|First, let me say I take full responsibility for my own actions, and for those of my administration.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_024.wav|As angry as I may be about activities undertaken without my knowledge, I am still accountable for those activities.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_025.wav|As disappointed as I may be in some who serve me, I am still the one who must answer to the American people for this behavior.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_026.wav|And as personally distasteful as I find secret bank accounts and diverted funds, what does the Navy would say?|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_027.wav|This happened on my watch.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_028.wav|Let's start with the part that is the most controversial.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_029.wav|A few months ago, I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_030.wav|My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_032.wav|This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_033.wav|There are reasons why it happened, but no excuses.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_034.wav|It was a mistake.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_035.wav|I undertook the original Iran initiative in order to develop relations with those who might assume leadership in a post-Homany government.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_037.wav|I asked so many questions about the hostages' welfare that I didn't ask enough about the specifics of the total Iran plan.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_038.wav|Let me say to the hostage families, we have not given up.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_039.wav|We never will, and I promise you will use every legitimate means to free your loved ones from captivity.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_040.wav|But I must also caution that those Americans who freely remain in such dangerous areas must know that they're responsible for their own safety.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_041.wav|Now, another major aspect of the Board's findings regards the transfer of funds to the Nicaraguan Contras.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_042.wav|The Tower Board wasn't able to find out what happened to this money.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_043.wav|So the facts here will be left to the continuing investigations of the court appointed independent council and the two congressional investigating committees.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_044.wav|I'm confident the truth will come out about this matter as well.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_045.wav|As I told the Tower Board, I didn't know about any diversion of funds to the Contras, but as President, I cannot escape responsibility.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_046.wav|Much has been said about my management style, a style that's worked successfully for me during eight years as Governor of California and for most of my presidency.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_047.wav|The way I work is to identify the problem, find the right individuals to do the job, and then let them go to it.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_048.wav|I found this invariably brings out the best in people.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_049.wav|They seem to rise to their full capability and in the long run, you get more done.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_050.wav|When it came to managing the NSC staff, let's face it, my style didn't match its previous track record.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_051.wav|I've already begun correcting this.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_052.wav|As a start yesterday, I met with the entire professional staff of the National Security Council.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_053.wav|I defined for them the values I want to guide the National Security policies of this country.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_054.wav|I told them that I wanted a policy that was as justifiable and understandable in public as it was in secret.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_056.wav|You've heard a lot about the staff of the National Security Council in recent months.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_057.wav|Well, I can tell you they are good and dedicated government employees who put in long hours for the nation's benefit.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_058.wav|They are eager and anxious to serve their country.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_059.wav|One thing still upsetting me, however, is that no one kept proper records of meetings or decisions.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_060.wav|This led to my failure to recollect whether I approved an arm shipment before or after the fact.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_061.wav|I did approve it.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_062.wav|I just can't say specifically when.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_063.wav|Well, rest assured there's plenty of record keeping now going on at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_064.wav|For nearly a week now, I've been studying the Board's report.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_065.wav|I want the American people to know that this wrenching ordeal of recent months has not been in vain.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_066.wav|I endorse every one of the tower board's recommendations.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_067.wav|In fact, I'm going beyond its recommendations so as to put the house in even better order.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_068.wav|I'm taking action in three basic areas.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_069.wav|Personnel, National Security Policy, and the process for making sure that the system works.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_070.wav|First, personnel.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_071.wav|I've brought in an accomplished and highly respected new team here at the White House.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_072.wav|They bring new blood, new energy, and new credibility and experience.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_073.wav|Former Senator Howard Baker, my new Chief of Staff possesses a breadth of legislative and foreign affairs skills that's impossible to match.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_075.wav|I'm genuinely honored that he's given up his own presidential aspirations to serve the country as my Chief of Staff.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_076.wav|Frank Karlochi, my new National Security Advisor, is respected for his experience in government and trusted for his judgment and counsel.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_077.wav|Under him, the NSC staff is being rebuilt with proper management discipline.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_078.wav|Already, almost half the NSC professional staff is comprised of new people.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_079.wav|Yesterday, I nominated William Webster, a man of sterling reputation, to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_080.wav|Mr. Webster has served as director of the FBI and as a U.S. District Court judge.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_081.wav|He understands the meaning of rule of law.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_082.wav|So that his knowledge of national security matters can be available to me on a continuing basis.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_083.wav|I will also appoint John Tower to serve as a member of my Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_084.wav|I am considering other changes in personnel and I'll move more furniture as I see fit in the weeks and months ahead.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_085.wav|Second, in the area of national security policy, I have ordered the NSC to begin a comprehensive review of all covert operations.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_086.wav|I have also directed that any covert activity be in support of clear policy objectives and in compliance with American values.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_087.wav|I expect a covert policy that if Americans saw it on the front page of their newspaper, they'd say that makes sense.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_088.wav|I have had issued a directive prohibiting the NSC staff itself from undertaking covert operations.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_089.wav|No ifs, ends, or buts.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_090.wav|I have asked Vice President Bush to reconvene his task force on terrorism, to review our terrorist policy in light of the events that have occurred.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_092.wav|I am directing Mr. Carlucci to take the necessary steps to make that happen.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_093.wav|He will report back to me on further reforms that might be needed.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_094.wav|I have created the post of NSC legal advisor to assure a greater sensitivity to matters of law.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_095.wav|I am also determined to make the congressional oversight process work.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_096.wav|Proper procedures for consultation with the Congress will be followed not only in letter but in spirit.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_097.wav|Before the end of March, I will report to the Congress on all the steps I've taken in line with the Tower Board's conclusions.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_098.wav|Now, what should happen when you make a mistake is this.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_099.wav|You take your knocks, you learn your lessons, and then you move on.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_100.wav|That's the healthiest way to deal with the problem.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_101.wav|There's no way to diminish the importance of the other continuing investigations, but the business of our country and our people must proceed.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_103.wav|And of course, I've heard the message from you, the American people.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_104.wav|You know, for the time you reach my age, you've made plenty of mistakes.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_105.wav|And if you've lived your life properly, so you learn.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_106.wav|You put things in perspective.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_107.wav|You pull your energies together, you change, you go forward.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_108.wav|I'm Federal Americans.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_109.wav|I have a great deal that I want to accomplish with you and for you over the next two years.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_110.wav|And the Lord willing, that's exactly what I intend to do.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_111.wav|Good night and God bless you.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_001.wav|this painful walk into the past has done much more than remind us of the war that consumed the European continent.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_003.wav|The survivors carry a memory beyond anything that we can comprehend.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_005.wav|Here lie people, Jews whose death was inflicted for no reason other than their very existence.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_007.wav|For year after year, until that man and his evil were destroyed, hell yond forth its awful contents.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_008.wav|People were brought here for no other purpose, but to suffer and die.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_010.wav|I'm sure we all share similar first thoughts.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_011.wav|That is what of the youngsters who died at this dark stall.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_013.wav|Try to think of being young and never having a day without searing emotional and physical pain, desolate, unreleaved pain.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_014.wav|Today we've been grimly reminded why the commandant of this camp was named the Beast of Belson.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_015.wav|Above all, we are struck by the horror of it all, the monstrous, incomprehensible horror.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_016.wav|And that's what we've seen, but is what we can never understand as the victims did.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_017.wav|Nor with all our compassion can we feel what the survivors feel to this day and what they will feel as long as they live.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_018.wav|What we've felt and are expressing with words cannot convey the suffering that they endured.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_019.wav|And that is why history will forever brand what happened as the Holocaust.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_020.wav|Here death ruled, but we've learned something as well.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_021.wav|Because of what happened, we found that death cannot rule forever.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_022.wav|And that's why we're here today.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_023.wav|We're here because humanity refuses to accept that freedom of the spirit of man can ever be extinguished.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_025.wav|Out of the ashes, hope, and from all the pain promise.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_026.wav|So much of this is symbolized today by the fact that most of the leadership of free Germany is represented here today.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_027.wav|Chancellor Coral, you and your countrymen have made real the renewal that had to happen.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_029.wav|This reflects the courage of your people and their devotion to freedom and justice since the war.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_030.wav|Think how far we've come from that time when despair made these tragic victims wonder if anything could survive.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_032.wav|Surely we can understand that when we see what is around us.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_033.wav|All these children of God under bleak and lifeless mounds, the planeness of which does not even hint at the unspeakable acts that created them.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_035.wav|And too many of them knew that this was their fate, but that was not the end.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_036.wav|Through it all was their faith and a spirit that moved their faith.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_037.wav|Nothing illustrates this better than the story of a young girl who died here at Burger Bellson.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_039.wav|Betrayed by an informant and her family were sent by freight car first to Auschwitz and finally here to Burger Bellson.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_040.wav|Just three weeks before her capture, young Anne wrote these words,|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_041.wav|it's really a wonder that I haven't dropped all my ideals because they seem so absurd and impossible to carry out.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_043.wav|I simply can't build up my hopes on a foundation consisting of confusion, misery, and death.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_044.wav|I see the world gradually being turned into a wilderness.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_045.wav|I hear the ever approaching thunder which will destroy us too.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_046.wav|I can feel the suffering of millions.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_047.wav|And yet, if I looked up into the heavens, I think that it will all come right.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_048.wav|That this cruelty too will end and that peace and tranquility will return again.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_049.wav|Eight months later, this sparkling young life ended here at Burger Bellson.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_050.wav|Somewhere here lies Anne Frank.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_051.wav|Everywhere here are memories pulling us, touching us, making us understand that they can never be erased.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_054.wav|We're all witnesses.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_055.wav|We share the glistening hope that rests in every human soul.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_056.wav|Hope leads us if we're prepared to trust it, toward what our President Lincoln called the better angels of our nature.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_058.wav|Never again.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_001.wav|Douglass McCartner made an unforgettable farewell to the country he loved and served so well.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_002.wav|Dwight Eisenhower reminded us that peace was purchased only at the price of strength and John F. Kennedy spoke of the burden and glory that is freedom.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_005.wav|It's my duty to report to you tonight on the progress that we have made in our relations with other nations.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_007.wav|Seldom have the stakes been higher for America.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_009.wav|To understand the state of the union, we must look not only at where we are and where we're going, but where we've been.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_010.wav|The situation at this time last year was truly ominous.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_011.wav|The last decade has seen a series of recessions.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_012.wav|There was a recession in 1970, in 1974, and again in the spring of 1980.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_013.wav|Each time unemployment increased and inflation soon turned up again.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_014.wav|We coined the word stagflation to describe this.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_015.wav|Government's response to these recessions was to pump up the money supply and increase spending.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_016.wav|In the last six months of 1980 as an example, the money supply increased to the fastest rate in post-war history, 13%.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_017.wav|Inflation remained in double digits, and government spending increased at an annual rate of 17%.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_018.wav|Interest rates reached a staggering 21.5%.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_019.wav|There were 8 million unemployed.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_021.wav|This time, however, things are different.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_022.wav|We have an economic program in place, completely different from the artificial quick fixes of the past.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_023.wav|It calls for a reduction of the rate of increase in government spending, and already that rate has been cut nearly in half.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_024.wav|But reduced spending alone isn't enough.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_025.wav|We've just implemented the first and smallest phase of a three-year tax rate reduction designed to stimulate the economy and create jobs.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_026.wav|Already, interest rates are down to 15 and 3.25%, but they must still go lower.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_027.wav|Inflation is down from 12.4% to 8.9, and for the month of December, it was running at an annualized rate of 5.2%.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_028.wav|If we had not acted as we did, a year ago, Americans' faith in their governmental process was steadily declining.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_029.wav|Six out of 10 Americans were saying they were pessimistic about their future.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_030.wav|A new kind of defeatism was heard.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_031.wav|Some said our domestic problems were uncontrollable, that we had to learn to live with this seemingly endless cycle of high inflation and high unemployment.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_032.wav|There were also pessimistic predictions about the relationship between our administration and this Congress.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_033.wav|It was said we could never work together.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_034.wav|Well, those predictions were wrong.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_039.wav|Together, we have cut the growth of new federal regulations nearly in half.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_040.wav|In 1981, there were 23,000 fewer pages in the federal register which lists new regulations.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_041.wav|We've come closer to achieving energy independence and help bring down the cost of gasoline and heating fuel.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_042.wav|Together, we have created an effective federal strike force to combat waste and fraud in government.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_043.wav|In just six months, it has saved the taxpayers more than $2 billion and it's only getting started.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_045.wav|Together, we've begun to restore that margin of military safety that ensures peace.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_046.wav|Our country's uniform is being worn once again with pride.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_047.wav|We have made a new beginning, but we have only begun.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_048.wav|No one pretends that the way ahead will be easy.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_049.wav|And I, in all due to the dress last year, I warned that the ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_052.wav|And that is why I can report to you tonight that in the near future, the state of the union and the economy will be better, much better.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_053.wav|If we summon the strength to continue on the course that we've charted.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_054.wav|And so the question, if the fundamentals are in place, what now?|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_055.wav|With two things.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_056.wav|First, we must understand what's happening at the moment to the economy.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_057.wav|Our current problems are not the product of the recovery program that's only just now getting underway.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_058.wav|Some would have you believe.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_059.wav|They are the inheritance of decades of tax and tax and spend and spend.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_060.wav|Second, because our economic problems are deeply rooted and will not respond to quick political fixes, we must stick to our carefully integrated plan for recovery.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_061.wav|And that plan is based on four common-sense fundamentals.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_064.wav|The doubters would have us turned back the clock with tax increases that would offset the personal tax rate reductions already passed by this Congress.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_065.wav|Raise present taxes to cut future deficits they tell us.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_066.wav|Well, I don't believe we should buy that argument.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_067.wav|There are too many imponderables for anyone to predict deficits or surplus as several years ahead with any degree of accuracy.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_068.wav|The budget is placed when I took office it has been projected as balanced.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_069.wav|It turned out to have one of the biggest deficits in history.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_072.wav|More important, we're making progress with the three keys to reducing deficits, economic growth, lower interest rates, and spending control.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_073.wav|The policies we have in place will reduce the deficits steadily, surely, and in time, completely.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_074.wav|Higher taxes would not mean lower deficits.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_076.wav|In 1980 tax revenues increased by $54 billion and in 1980 we had one of our all-time biggest deficits.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_077.wav|Raising taxes won't balance the budget.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_078.wav|It will encourage more government spending and less private investment.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_080.wav|So to provide them incentives to rebuild our economy, to save, to invest in America's future, I will stand by my word.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_082.wav|And the continued high interest rates last year cost the government about $5 billion more than anticipated.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_085.wav|We will continue to redirect our resources to our two highest budget priorities.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_087.wav|Contrary to some of the wild charges you may have heard, this administration has not and will not turn its back on America's elderly or America's poor.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_088.wav|Funding for social insurance programs will be more than double the amount spent only six years ago.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_089.wav|But it would be foolish to pretend that these or any programs cannot be made more efficient and economical.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_090.wav|The entitlement programs that make up our safety net for the truly needy have worthy goals and many deserving recipients.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_091.wav|We will protect them.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_092.wav|But there's only one way to see to it that these programs really help those whom they were designed to help and that is to bring their spiraling costs under control.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_096.wav|Another example is Medicare and Medicaid programs with worthy goals.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_097.wav|But whose costs have increased from 11.2 billion to almost 60 billion more than five times as much in just 10 years.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_098.wav|Waste and fraud and our serious problems.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_100.wav|One official said many of the people who were cheating the system were very confident that nothing was going to happen to them.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_101.wav|Well something is going to happen.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_103.wav|The time has come to control the uncontrollable.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_104.wav|In August we made a start.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_105.wav|I signed a bill to reduce the growth of these programs by $44 billion over the next three years.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_106.wav|By the same time preserving essential services for the truly needy.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_107.wav|Shortly you will receive from me a message on further reforms we intend to install.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_108.wav|Some new but others long recommended by your own congressional committees.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_109.wav|I ask you to help make these savings for the American taxpayer.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_111.wav|But don't be fooled by those who proclaim that spending cuts will deprive the elderly the needy and the helpless.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_112.wav|The federal government will still subsidize 95 million meals every day.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_113.wav|That's one out of seven of all the meals served in America.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_114.wav|Head start, senior nutrition programs and child welfare programs will not be cut from the levels we proposed last year.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_120.wav|And they're right.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_121.wav|A maze of interlocking jurisdictions and levels of government confronts average citizens in trying to solve even the simplest of problems.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_122.wav|They don't know where to turn for answers, who to hold accountable, who to praise, who to blame, who to go for or against.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_123.wav|The main reason for this is the overpowering growth of federal grants in eight programs during the past few decades.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_124.wav|In 1960 the federal government had 132 categorical grant programs costing seven billion dollars.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_125.wav|When I took office there were approximately 500 costing nearly a hundred billion dollars.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_126.wav|13 programs for energy.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_127.wav|36 for pollution control.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_128.wav|66 for social services.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_129.wav|90 for education.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_130.wav|And here in the Congress it takes at least 166 committees just to try to keep track of them.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_131.wav|You know and I know that neither the President nor the Congress can properly oversee this jungle of grants in aid.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_132.wav|Indeed the growth of these grants has led to the distortion in the vital functions of government.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_134.wav|Well let's solve this problem with a single bull stroke.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_136.wav|I will shortly send this Congress a message describing this program.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_141.wav|The total amount flowing into this fund will be $28 billion a year.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_142.wav|Over the next four years the states can use this money in either of two ways.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_144.wav|There will be a mandatory pass-through of part of these funds to local governments.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_145.wav|By 1988 the states will be in complete control of over 40 federal grant programs.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_146.wav|The trust fund will start to phase out eventually to disappear and the excise taxes will be turned over to the states.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_147.wav|They can then preserve lower or raised taxes on their own and fund and manage these programs as they see fit.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_149.wav|Hand in hand with this program to strengthen the discretion and flexibility of state and local governments.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_150.wav|We are proposing legislation for an experimental effort to improve and develop our depressed urban areas in the 1990s.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_151.wav|This legislation will permit states and localities to apply to the federal government for designation as urban enterprise zones.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_153.wav|Some will say our mission is to save free enterprise.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_155.wav|This administration has faith in state and local governments and the constitutional balance in vision to the founding fathers.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_156.wav|We also believe in the integrity, decency and sound good sense of grassroots Americans.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_157.wav|Our faith in the American people is reflected in another major endeavor.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_159.wav|Such groups are almost invariably far more efficient than government in running social programs.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_160.wav|We are not asking them to replace discarded and often discredited government programs dollar for dollar service for service.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_161.wav|We just want to help them perform the good works they choose and help others to profit by their example.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_163.wav|The volunteer spirit is still alive and well in America for all our citizens.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_164.wav|Once a source of discord, now a source of pride must continue with no backsliding or slowing down.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_165.wav|We must and shall see that those basic laws that guarantee equal rights are preserved and when necessary strengthen.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_166.wav|Our concern for equal rights for women is firm and unshakable.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_169.wav|We look forward to the enactment of a responsible clean air act to increase jobs while continuing to improve the quality of our air.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_170.wav|We're encouraged by the bipartisan initiative of the House and are hopeful of further progress as the Senate continues its deliberations.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_171.wav|So far, I've concentrated largely now on domestic matters.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_172.wav|To view the state of the union and perspective, we must not ignore the rest of the world.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_173.wav|There isn't time to night for a lengthy treatment of social or foreign policy, I should say.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_174.wav|A subject I intend to address in detail in the near future.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_176.wav|At Ottawa and Concoune, I met with leaders of the major industrial powers and developing nations.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_177.wav|Now, some of those I met were a little surprised that I didn't apologize for America's wealth.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_179.wav|I believe lasting friendships were made and the foundation was laid for future cooperation.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_181.wav|Toward those who would export terrorism and subversion the Caribbean and elsewhere, especially Cuba and Libya, we will act with firmness.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_182.wav|Our foreign policy is a policy of strength, fairness and balance.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_185.wav|Continue to deteriorate further deteriorate.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_186.wav|Further measures will follow.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_187.wav|Now let me also note that private American groups have taken the lead in making January 30th a day of solidarity with the people of Poland.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_188.wav|So too, the European Parliament has called for March 21st to be an international day of support for Afghanistan.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_189.wav|I urge all peace-loving peoples to join together on those days, to raise their voices, to speak and pray for freedom.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_190.wav|Meanwhile, we're working for reduction of arms and military activities, as I announced in my address to the nation last November 18th.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_192.wav|In those talks, it is essential that we negotiate from a position of strength.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_193.wav|There must be a real incentive for the Soviets to take these talks seriously.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_194.wav|This requires that we rebuild our defenses.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_196.wav|The protection of our national security has required that we undertake a substantial program to enhance our military forces.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_197.wav|We have not neglected to strengthen our traditional alliances in Europe and Asia, or to develop key relationships with our partners in the Middle East and other countries.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_198.wav|Building a more peaceful world requires a sound strategy and the national resolve to back it up.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_200.wav|That's why we've laid such stress not only on our own defense, but on our vital foreign assistance program.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_202.wav|Our foreign policy must be rooted in realism, not naivete or self-delusion.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_203.wav|A recognition of what the Soviet Empire is about is the starting point.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_204.wav|Winston Churchill and negotiating with the Soviets observed that they respect only strength and resolve in their dealings with other nations.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_205.wav|That's why we've moved to reconstruct our national defenses.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_206.wav|We intend to keep the peace.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_207.wav|We will also keep our freedom.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_208.wav|In the face of a climate of falsehood and misinformation, we've promised the world a season of truth.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_209.wav|The truth of our great civilized ideas, individual liberty, representative government, the rule of law under God.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_211.wav|Yes, we have our problems.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_212.wav|Yes, we're in a time of recession.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_213.wav|And as true, there's no quick fix as I said to instantly end the tragic pain of unemployment.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_214.wav|But we will end it.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_215.wav|The process has already begun and we'll see its effect as the year goes on.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_216.wav|We speak with pride and admiration of that little band of Americans who overcame insuperable odds to set this nation on course 200 years ago.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_217.wav|But our glory didn't end with them.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_218.wav|Americans ever since have emulated their deeds.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_219.wav|We don't have to turn to our history books for heroes.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_220.wav|They're all around us.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_221.wav|One who sits among you here tonight, he put a wise that heroism at the end of the longest imprisonment ever inflicted on men of our armed forces.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_223.wav|The plane door opened and Jeremiah Deppin came slowly down the ramp.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_224.wav|He caught sight of our flag, saluted it, said God bless America in the midst of a terrible tragedy on the Potomac.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_225.wav|We saw again the spirit of American heroism at its finest.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_226.wav|The heroism of dedicated rescue workers saving crash victims from icy waters.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_228.wav|Parents who sacrifice long and hard so their children will know a better life than they've known.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_229.wav|Church and civic volunteers who helped to feed, cloth, nurse and teach the needy.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_230.wav|Millions who've made our nation and our nation's destiny so very special.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_231.wav|Unsung heroes who may not have realized their own dreams themselves, but then who reinvest those dreams in their children.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_232.wav|Don't let anyone tell you that America's best days are behind her, that the American spirit has been vanquished.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_233.wav|We've seen a triumphant of our lives, the greatest of all our presidents, delivered his second state of the Union message in this chamber.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_234.wav|We cannot escape history, Abraham Lincoln warned.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_235.wav|We of this Congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_236.wav|The trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_237.wav|Well, that president and that Congress did not fail the American people.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_238.wav|Together they weathered the storm and preserved the Union.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_239.wav|Let it be said of us that we too did not fail.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_240.wav|That we too worked together to bring America through difficult times.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_001.wav|uh, my fellow Americans, thank you for sharing your time with me tonight.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_003.wav|A decision I'll tell you about in a few minutes, and important because there's a very big decision that you must make for yourselves.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_004.wav|This subject involves the most basic duty that any president and any people share, the duty to protect and strengthen the peace.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_006.wav|That budget is much more than a long list of numbers.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_007.wav|From behind all the numbers lies America's ability to prevent the greatest of human tragedies and preserve our free way of life in a sometimes dangerous world.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_008.wav|It is part of a careful long-term plan to make America strong again after too many years of neglect and mistakes.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_009.wav|Our efforts to rebuild America's defenses and strengthen the peace began two years ago when we requested a major increase in the defense program.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_010.wav|Since then, the amount of those increases we first proposed has been reduced by half through improvements in management and procurement and other savings.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_011.wav|The budget request that is now before the Congress has been trimmed to the limits of safety.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_012.wav|Further deep cuts cannot be made without seriously endangering the security of the nation.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_013.wav|The choice is up to the men and women you've elected to the Congress, and that means the choice is up to you.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_015.wav|And I want to offer hope for the future.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_016.wav|But first, let me say what the defense debate is not about.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_017.wav|It is not about spending arithmetic.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_018.wav|I know that in the last few weeks you've been bombarded with numbers and percentages, some say we need only a 5% increase in defense spending.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_019.wav|The so-called alternate budget backed by liberals in the House of Representatives were the lower the figure to 2 to 3%.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_020.wav|Cutting our defense spending by $163 billion over the next five years.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_022.wav|What seems to have been lost in all this debate is the simple truth of how a defense budget is arrived at.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_023.wav|It isn't done by deciding to spend a certain number of dollars.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_024.wav|Those loud voices that are occasionally heard charging that the government is trying to solve a security problem by throwing money at it are nothing more than noise based on ignorance.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_025.wav|We start by considering what must be done to maintain peace and review all the possible threats against our security.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_026.wav|Then a strategy for strengthening peace and defending against those threats must be agreed upon.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_027.wav|And finally, our defense establishment must be evaluated to see what is necessary to protect against any or all of the potential threats.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_028.wav|The cost of achieving these ends is totaled up, and the result is the budget for national defense.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_029.wav|There is no logical way that you can say let's spend $X billion less.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_030.wav|You can only say which part of our defense measures do we believe we can do without and still have security against all contingencies?|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_032.wav|The defense policy of the United States is based on a simple premise.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_033.wav|The United States does not start fights.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_034.wav|We will never be an aggressor.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_035.wav|We maintain our strength in order to deter and defend against aggression, to preserve freedom and peace.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_036.wav|Since the dawn of the atomic age we've sought to reduce the risk of war by maintaining a strong deterrent and by seeking genuine arms control.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_038.wav|Once he understands that he won't attack.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_039.wav|We maintain the peace through our strength.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_040.wav|Weakness only invites aggression.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_041.wav|This strategy of deterrence has not changed.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_043.wav|But what it takes to maintain deterrence has changed.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_044.wav|It took one kind of military force to deter an attack when we had far more nuclear weapons than any other power.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_045.wav|It takes another kind now that the Soviets, for example, have enough accurate and powerful nuclear weapons to destroy virtually all of our missiles on the ground.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_046.wav|Now this is not to say that the Soviet Union is planning to make war on us.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_047.wav|Nor do I believe a war is inevitable, quite the contrary.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_048.wav|But what must be recognized is that our security is based on being prepared to meet all threats.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_049.wav|There was a time when we depended on coastal forts and artillery batteries because with the weaponry of that day any attack would have had to come by sea.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_050.wav|Well this is a different world and our defenses must be based on recognition and awareness of the weaponry possessed by other nations in the nuclear age.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_051.wav|We can't afford to believe that we will never be threatened.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_052.wav|There have been two world wars in my lifetime.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_053.wav|We didn't start them and indeed did everything we could to avoid being drawn into them.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_054.wav|But we were ill-prepared for both.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_055.wav|Had we been better prepared, peace might have been preserved.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_056.wav|For 20 years the Soviet Union has been accumulating enormous military night.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_057.wav|They didn't stop when their forces exceeded all requirements of a legitimate defensive capability and they haven't stopped now.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_059.wav|As an example, the United States introduced its last new intercontinental ballistic missile, the Minuteman III in 1969.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_060.wav|And we're now dismantling our even older Titan missiles.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_061.wav|But what has the Soviet Union done in these intervening years?|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_062.wav|Well since 1969 the Soviet Union has built five new classes of ICBMs and upgraded these eight times.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_064.wav|The same thing has happened in other areas.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_065.wav|Over the same period the Soviet Union built four new classes of submarine-launched ballistic missiles and over 60 new missile submarines.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_066.wav|We built two new types of submarine missiles and actually withdrew 10 submarines from strategic missions.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_067.wav|The Soviet Union built over 200 new backfire bombers and their brand new Blackjack bomber is now under development.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_069.wav|Indeed, despite what many people think, our strategic forces only cost about 15 percent of the defense budget.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_070.wav|Another example of what's happened.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_071.wav|In 1978 the Soviets had 600 intermediate-range nuclear missiles based on land and were beginning to add the SS-20.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_072.wav|A new highly accurate mobile missile with three warheads.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_073.wav|We had none.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_074.wav|Since then the Soviets have strengthened their lead by the end of 1979 when Soviet leader Brezhnev declared a balance now exists.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_075.wav|The Soviets had over 800 warheads.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_076.wav|We still had none.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_077.wav|A year ago this month Mr. Brezhnev pledged a moratorium or freeze on SS-20 deployment, but by last August their 800 warheads had become more than 1200.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_078.wav|We still had none.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_081.wav|These warheads can reach their targets in a matter of a few minutes.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_082.wav|We still have none.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_083.wav|So far it seems that the Soviet definition of parity is a box score of 1,300 to nothing in their favor.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_085.wav|We will begin that deployment late this year.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_086.wav|At the same time however we are willing to cancel our program if the Soviets will dismantle theirs.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_087.wav|This is what we call a zero zero plan.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_088.wav|The Soviets are now at the negotiating table and I think it's fair to say that without our planned deployments they wouldn't be there.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_089.wav|Now let's consider conventional forces.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_090.wav|Since 1974 the United States has produced 3,050 tactical combat aircraft.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_091.wav|By contrast the Soviet Union has produced twice as many.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_092.wav|When we look at attack submarines the United States has produced 27 while the Soviet Union has produced 61.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_093.wav|For armored vehicles including tanks we've produced 11,200.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_094.wav|The Soviet Union has produced 54,000 nearly five to one in their favor.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_096.wav|There was a time when we were able to offset superior Soviet numbers with higher quality.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_097.wav|But today they're building weapons as sophisticated and modern as our own.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_098.wav|As the Soviets have increased their military power they've been emboldened to extend that power.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_099.wav|They're spreading their military influence in ways that can directly challenge our vital interests and those of our allies.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_100.wav|The following aerial photographs most of them secret until now.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_101.wav|Illustrate this point in a crucial area very close to home.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_102.wav|Central America and the Caribbean Basin.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_103.wav|They're not dramatic photographs but I think they help give you a better understanding of what I'm talking about.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_104.wav|This Soviet intelligence collection facility less than 100 miles from our coast is the largest of its kind in the world.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_105.wav|The acres and acres of antenna fields and intelligence monitors are targeted on key US military installations and sensitive activities.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_107.wav|This 28 square mile facility has grown by more than 60 percent in size and capability during the past decade.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_108.wav|In Western Cuba we see this military airfield and its complement of modern Soviet built MiG-23 aircraft.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_110.wav|During the past two years the level of Soviet arms exports to Cuba can only be compared to the levels reached during the Cuban missile crisis 20 years ago.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_114.wav|Grenade doesn't even have an air force.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_115.wav|Who is it intended for?|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_116.wav|The Caribbean is a very important passageway for our international commerce and military lines of communication.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_117.wav|More than half of all American oil imports now pass through the Caribbean.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_118.wav|The rapid buildup of Grenade's military potential is unrelated to any conceivable threat to this island country of under 110,000 people.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_119.wav|And totally at odds with the pattern of other eastern Caribbean states most of which are unarmed.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_121.wav|These pictures only tell a small part of the story.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_122.wav|I wish I could show you more without compromising our most sensitive intelligence sources and methods.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_123.wav|But the Soviet Union is also supporting Cuban military forces in Angola and Ethiopia.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_124.wav|They have bases in Ethiopia and South Yemen near the Persian Gulf oil fields.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_125.wav|They have taken over the port that we built at Cameran Bay in Vietnam.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_126.wav|And now for the first time in history the Soviet Navy is a force to be reckoned with in the South Pacific.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_127.wav|Some people may still ask, would the Soviets ever use their formidable military power?|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_128.wav|Well again, can we afford to believe they won't?|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_130.wav|The final fact is that the Soviet Union is acquiring what can only be considered an offensive military force.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_131.wav|They have continued to build far more intercontinental ballistic missiles than they could possibly need simply to deter an attack.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_132.wav|Their conventional forces are trained and equipped not so much to defend against an attack as they are to permit sudden surprise offensive of their own.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_133.wav|Our NATO allies have assumed a great defense burden including the military draft in most countries.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_134.wav|We're working with them and our other friends around the world to do more.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_135.wav|Our defensive strategy means we need military forces that can move very quickly.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_136.wav|Forces that are trained and ready to respond to any emergency.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_138.wav|Unfortunately a decade of neglecting our military forces had called into question our ability to do that.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_139.wav|When I took office in January 1981 I was appalled by what I found.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_140.wav|American planes that couldn't fly and American ships that couldn't sail for lack of spare parts and trained personnel and insufficient fuel and ammunition for essential training.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_143.wav|We had to move immediately to improve the basic readiness and staying power of our conventional forces so they could meet and therefore help deter a crisis.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_145.wav|I know that all of you want peace and so do I.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_146.wav|I know too that many of you seriously believe that a nuclear freeze would further the cause of peace.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_147.wav|But a freeze now would make us less, not more secure and would raise, not reduce, the risks of war.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_148.wav|It would be largely unverifiable and would seriously undercut our negotiations on arms reduction.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_149.wav|It would reward the Soviets for their massive military build-up while preventing us from modernizing our aging and increasingly vulnerable forces.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_150.wav|With their present margin of superiority, why should they agree to arms reductions knowing that we were prohibited from catching up?|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_151.wav|Believe me, it wasn't pleasant for someone who had come to Washington to determine to reduce government spending.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_152.wav|But we had to move forward with the task of repairing our defenses, or we would lose our ability to deter conflict now and in the future.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_154.wav|The kind we're working for right now in Geneva.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_155.wav|Thanks to your strong support and bipartisan support from the Congress, we began to turn things around.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_156.wav|Already, we're seeing some very encouraging results.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_157.wav|Quality recruitment and retention are up dramatically.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_158.wav|More high school graduates are choosing military careers and more experienced career personnel are choosing to stay.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_159.wav|Our men and women in uniform at last are getting the tools and training they need to do their job.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_160.wav|Asking around today, especially among our young people, and I think you'll find a whole new attitude towards serving their country.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_161.wav|This reflects more than just better pay, equipment and leadership.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_162.wav|You, the American people, have sent a signal to these young people that it is once again an honor to wear the uniform.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_163.wav|That's not something you measure in a budget, but it's a very real part of our nation's strength.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_164.wav|It'll take us longer to build the kind of equipment we need to keep peace in the future, but we've made a good start.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_165.wav|We haven't built a new long-range bomber for 21 years.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_166.wav|Now we're building the B1.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_167.wav|We hadn't launched one new strategic submarine for 17 years.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_168.wav|Now we're building one Triton submarine a year.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_169.wav|Our land-based missiles are increasingly threatened by the many huge new Soviet ICBMs.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_170.wav|We're determining how to solve that problem.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_172.wav|We have also begun the long-needed modernization of our conventional forces.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_173.wav|The Army is getting its first new tank in 20 years.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_174.wav|The Air Force is modernizing.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_175.wav|We're rebuilding our Navy, which shrank from about a thousand ships in the late 1960s to 453 during the 1970s.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_176.wav|Our nation needs a superior Navy to support our military forces and vital interests overseas.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_177.wav|We're now on the road to achieving a 600-ship Navy and increasing the amphibious capabilities of our Marines, who are now serving the cause of peace in Lebanon.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_178.wav|And we're building a real capability to assist our friends in the vitally important Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf region.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_179.wav|This adds up to a major effort, and it isn't cheap.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_180.wav|It comes at a time when there are many other pressures on our budget, and when the American people have already had to make major sacrifices during the recession.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_181.wav|But we must not be misled by those who would make defense once again the scapegoat of the federal budget.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_182.wav|The fact is that in the past few decades, we have seen a dramatic shift in how we spend the taxpayers' dollar.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_183.wav|Back in 1955, payments to individuals took up only about 20 percent of the federal budget.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_184.wav|For nearly three decades, these payments steadily increased, and this year will account for 49 percent of the budget.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_185.wav|By contrast, in 1955, defense took up more than half of the federal budget.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_186.wav|By 1980, this spending had fallen to a low of 23 percent.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_187.wav|Even with the increase that I am requesting this year, defense will still amount to only 28 percent of the budget.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_188.wav|The calls for cutting back the defense budget come in nice, simple arithmetic.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_189.wav|They're the same kind of talk that led the democracies to neglect their defenses in the 1930s and invited the tragedy of World War II.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_190.wav|We must not let that grim chapter of history repeat itself through apathy or neglect.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_191.wav|This is why I'm speaking to you tonight.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_192.wav|Doers you to tell your senators and congressmen that you know we must continue to restore our military strength?|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_193.wav|If we stop in midstream, we will send a signal of decline, of lessened will, to friends and adversaries alike.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_194.wav|Free people must voluntarily, through open debate and democratic means, meet the challenge that totalitarians pose by compulsion.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_197.wav|Now, thus far tonight, I've shared with you my thoughts on the problems of national security we must face together.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_198.wav|My predecessors in the Oval Office have appeared before you on other occasions to describe the threat posed by Soviet power and to propose steps to address that threat.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_199.wav|But since the advent of nuclear weapons, those steps have been increasingly directed toward deterrence of aggression through the promise of retaliation.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_200.wav|This approach to stability through offensive threat has worked.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_201.wav|We and our allies have succeeded in preventing nuclear war for more than three decades.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_205.wav|One of the most important contributions we can make is, of course, to lower the level of all arms and particularly nuclear arms.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_206.wav|We're engaged right now in several negotiations with the Soviet Union to bring about a mutual reduction of weapons.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_207.wav|I will report to you a week from tomorrow my thoughts on that score.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_208.wav|But let me just say I'm totally committed to this course.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_209.wav|If the Soviet Union will join with us in our effort to achieve major arms reduction, we will have succeeded in stabilizing the nuclear balance.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_210.wav|Nevertheless, it will still be necessary to rely on the specter of retaliation on mutual threat.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_211.wav|And that's a sad commentary on the human condition.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_212.wav|Wouldn't it be better to save lives than to avenge them?|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_213.wav|Are we not capable of demonstrating our peaceful intentions by applying all our abilities and our ingenuity to achieving a truly lasting stability?|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_214.wav|I think we are.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_215.wav|Indeed, we must.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_216.wav|After careful consultation with my advisors, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I believe there is a way.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_217.wav|Let me share with you a vision of the future which offers hope.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_218.wav|It is that we embark on a program to counter the awesome Soviet missile threat with measures that are defensive.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_219.wav|Let us turn to the very strengths in technology that spawned our great industrial base and that have given us the quality of life we enjoy today.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_221.wav|I know this is a formidable technical task, one that may not be accomplished before the end of this century.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_222.wav|Yet current technology has attained a level of sophistication where it's reasonable for us to begin this effort.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_223.wav|It will take years, probably decades of effort on many fronts.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_224.wav|There will be failures and setbacks, just as there will be successes and breakthroughs.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_225.wav|And as we proceed, we must remain constant in preserving the nuclear deterrent and maintaining a solid capability for flexible response.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_226.wav|But isn't it worth every investment necessary to free the world from the threat of nuclear war?|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_227.wav|We know it is.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_230.wav|America does possess now the technologies to attain very significant improvements in the effectiveness of our conventional non-nuclear forces.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_232.wav|As we pursue our goal of defensive technologies, we recognize that our allies rely up on our strategic offensive power to deter attacks against them.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_233.wav|Their vital interests and hours are inextricably linked.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_234.wav|Their safety and hours are won, and no change in technology can or will alter that reality.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_235.wav|We must and shall continue to honor our commitments.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_236.wav|I clearly recognize that defensive systems have limitations and raise certain problems and ambiguities.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_237.wav|If paired with offensive systems, they can be viewed as fostering an aggressive policy, and no one wants that.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_241.wav|This could pave the way for arms control measures to eliminate the weapons themselves.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_242.wav|We seek neither military superiority nor political advantage.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_243.wav|Our only purpose, one all people share, is to search for ways to reduce the danger of nuclear war.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_244.wav|I fell to Americans, tonight we're launching an effort which holds the promise of changing the course of human history.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_245.wav|There will be risks and results take time, but I believe we can do it.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_246.wav|As we cross this threshold, I ask for your prayers and your support.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_247.wav|Thank you, good night and God bless you.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_002.wav|I have seen the birth of communism.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_003.wav|I have witnessed a bloody futility of two world wars and Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_004.wav|I have seen Germany united, divided and united again.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_005.wav|I have seen television grow from a power novelty to become the most powerful vehicle of communication in history.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_006.wav|As a boy, I saw streets filled with model teas.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_007.wav|As a man, I have met men who walked on the moon.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_008.wav|I have not only seen but lived the marvels of what historians have called the American century.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_011.wav|This powerful sense of energy has made American synonymous for opportunity the world over.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_012.wav|And after generations of struggle, America is the moral force that defeated communism.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_015.wav|Once wrote in his diary, many thinking people believe America has seen its best days.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_016.wav|He wrote that July 26, 1775.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_018.wav|My friends, I utterly reject those views.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_019.wav|Who among us would trade America's future for that of any other country in the world?|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_020.wav|And who could possibly have so little faith in our American people that they would trade our tomorrow for our yesterday?|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_021.wav|I'll give you a hint.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_025.wav|It was a world where aggressive Soviet communism was on the rise, an America strength was in decline.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_026.wav|It was a world where our children came of age under the threat of nuclear holocaust.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_028.wav|But we stood tall and proclaimed that communism was destined for the ash heap of history.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_029.wav|The sky would not fall if America restored her strength and resolved.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_030.wav|The sky would not fall if an American president spoke the truth.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_031.wav|But where they see only problems, I see possibilities as vast and diverse as the American family itself.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_032.wav|Even as we meet the rest of the world is astounded by the pundits and finger pointers who are so down on us as a nation.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_033.wav|What I've said it before and I'll say it again.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_034.wav|America remains what Emerson called her 150 years ago, the country of tomorrow.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_037.wav|A man who understands government, who understands our country and who understands the world.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_039.wav|By his own admission, he is a quiet man and not a shaman.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_040.wav|He is a trustworthy and level-headed leader who is respected around the world.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_041.wav|His is a steady hand on the tiller through the choppy waters of the 90s, which is exactly what we need.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_043.wav|We have a simple slogan for November 1992.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_046.wav|Each of those elections had its shifting moods of the moment, his headlines of one day that were forgotten the next.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_049.wav|Now is the time for choosing.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_050.wav|As it did 12 years ago, and as we have seen many times in history, our country now stands at a crossroads.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_052.wav|And as they did then, the American people are clamoring for change and sweeping reform.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_053.wav|The question we had to ask 12 years ago is the question we ask today.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_054.wav|What kind of change can we Republicans offer the American people?|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_055.wav|Some might believe that the things we've talked about tonight are irrelevant to the choice.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_057.wav|They insist that our triumph is yesterday's news, part of a past that holds no lessons for the future.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_060.wav|We are the country of tomorrow.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_062.wav|But just as we have led the crusade for democracy beyond our shores, we have a great task to do together in our own home.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_064.wav|Every day brings fresh challenges and opportunities to match.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_065.wav|With each sunrise, we are reminded that millions of our citizens have yet to share in the abundance of American prosperity.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_066.wav|Many languish in neighborhood riddled with drugs and bereft of hope.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_067.wav|Still others hesitate to venture out on the streets for fear of criminal violence.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_068.wav|Let us pledge ourselves to a new beginning for them.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_075.wav|I have always believed in you and in what you could accomplish for yourselves and for others.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_077.wav|My dream is that you will travel the road ahead with liberty's lamp guiding your steps and opportunities arm, steadying your way.|1|81
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_005.wav|You have given us a memory that we'll treasure forever.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_006.wav|And you've provided, provided an answer to those few voices that were raised saying that what happened was evidence that ours is a six society.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_007.wav|The society we heard from is made up of millions of compassionate Americans and their children from college age to kindergarten.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_008.wav|As a matter of fact, as evidence of that, I have a letter with me.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_009.wav|Letter came from Peter Swini.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_010.wav|He's in the second grade in the Riverside School in Rockville Center.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_011.wav|And he said,|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_012.wav|I hope you get well quick.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_013.wav|Let's talk about getting spending and inflation under control and cutting your tax rates.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_014.wav|Mr. Speaker and Senator Baker,|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_015.wav|I want to thank you for your cooperation in helping to arrange this joint session of the Congress.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_016.wav|I won't be speaking to you very long tonight, but I ask for this meeting because the urgency of our joint mission has not changed.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_017.wav|Thanks to some very fine people, my health is much improved.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_019.wav|Where have we come in these six months?|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_020.wav|Inflation is measured by the Consumer Price Index has continued at a double digit rate.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_021.wav|Mortgage interest rates have averaged almost 15 percent for these six months, preventing families across America from buying homes.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_022.wav|There are still almost eight million unemployed.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_024.wav|Six months is long enough.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_025.wav|American people now want us to act and not in half measures.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_026.wav|They demand and they've earned a full and comprehensive effort to clean up our economic mess.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_029.wav|And the budgetary actions taken with the Congress over the next few days will determine how we respond to the message of last November 4th.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_030.wav|That message was very simple.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_031.wav|Our government is too big.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_032.wav|You and I have enjoyed a relationship based on extraordinary cooperation.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_033.wav|Because of this cooperation, we've come a long distance in less than three months.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_035.wav|We have also communicated in a spirit of candor, openness and mutual respect.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_036.wav|Tonight, as our decision day nears and as the House of Representatives weighs its alternatives, I wish to address you in that same spirit.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_038.wav|But an equally crucial test involves the House of Representatives.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_039.wav|The House will soon be choosing between two different versions or measures to deal with the economy.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_040.wav|One is the measure offered by the House Budget Committee.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_041.wav|The other is a bipartisan measure, a substitute introduced by Congressman Phil Graham of Texas and Del Lata of Ohio.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_043.wav|At the same time, however, I must state our opposition to the measure offered by the House Budget Committee.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_044.wav|It may appear that we have two alternatives.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_045.wav|In reality, however, there are no more alternatives left.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_046.wav|The committee measure quite simply falls far too short of the essential actions that we must take.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_047.wav|For example, in the next three years, the committee measure projects spending $141 billion more than does the bipartisan substitute.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_048.wav|It regrettably cuts over $14 billion in essential defense spending, funding required to restore America's national security.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_049.wav|It adheres to the failed policy of trying to balance the budget on the taxpayers' back.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_050.wav|It would increase tax payments by over a third, adding up to a staggering quarter of a trillion dollars.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_051.wav|Federal taxes would increase 12 percent each year.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_052.wav|Taxpayers would be paying a larger share of their income to government in 1984 than they do with President.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_053.wav|In short, that measure reflects an echo of the past rather than a benchmark for the future.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_054.wav|High taxes and excess spending growth created our present economic mess.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_055.wav|More of the same will not cure the hardship, anxiety, and discouragement it is imposed on the American people.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_056.wav|Let us cut through the fog for a moment.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_057.wav|The answer to a government that is too big is to stop feeding its growth.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_058.wav|Government spending has been growing faster than the economy itself.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_059.wav|The massive national debt which we accumulated is the result of the government's high spending diet, will it's time to change the diet and to change it in the right way.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_060.wav|Let me make a few points that I feel have been overlooked.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_061.wav|First of all, it should be looked at as an integral part of the entire package.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_062.wav|Not something separate and apart from the budget reductions, the regulatory relief, and the monetary restraints.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_063.wav|Probably the most common misconception is that we are proposing to reduce government revenues to less than what the government has been receiving.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_064.wav|This is not true.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_065.wav|Actually, the discussion has to do with how much of a tax increase should be imposed on the taxpayer in 1982.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_066.wav|I know that over the recess in some informal polling, some of your constituents have been asked which they'd rather have, a balanced budget or a tax cut.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_067.wav|And with a common sense that characterizes the people of this country, the answer, of course, has been a balanced budget.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_068.wav|But may I suggest, with no inference that there was wrong intent in the part of those who asked the question, the question was inappropriate to the situation.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_069.wav|Our choice is not between a balanced budget and a tax cut.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_071.wav|With a common sense that the people have already shown, I'm sure we all know what the answer to that question would be.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_072.wav|A gigantic tax increase has been built into the system.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_073.wav|We propose nothing more than a reduction of that increase.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_075.wav|Should I believe, offered by the House Budget Committee, will leave spending too high and tax rates too high.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_080.wav|The economic recovery package that I have outlined a year over the past few weeks is, I deeply believe, the only answer that we have left.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_082.wav|These policies will make our economy stronger, and the stronger economy will balance the budget which we are committed to do by 1984.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_083.wav|I pledge loyalty to only one special interest group.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_084.wav|We, the people, those people, neighbors and friends, shopkeepers and laborers, farmers and craftsmen do not have infinite patience.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_085.wav|As a matter of fact, some 80 years ago, Teddy Roosevelt wrote these instructive words in his first message to the Congress.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_086.wav|The American people are slowed her wrath, but when their wrath is once kindled, it burns like a consuming flame.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_087.wav|Well, perhaps that kind of wrath will be deserved if our answer to these serious problems is to repeat the mistakes of the past.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_088.wav|The old and comfortable way is to shave a little here and add a little there.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_089.wav|Well, that's not acceptable anymore.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_090.wav|I think this great and historic Congress knows that way is no longer acceptable.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_092.wav|I think the bipartisan substitute bill has achieved that purpose.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_093.wav|It moves us toward economic vitality.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_096.wav|And each amazing achievement became commonplace until the next new challenge was raised.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_097.wav|With a space shuttle, we tested our ingenuity once again, moving beyond the accomplishments of the past into the promise and uncertainty of the future.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_099.wav|The space shuttle did more than prove our technological abilities.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_100.wav|It raised our expectations once more.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_101.wav|It started as dreaming again.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_102.wav|The poet Carl Sandberg wrote, the Republic is a dream.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_103.wav|Nothing happens unless first a dream.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_104.wav|And that's what makes us as Americans different.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_105.wav|We've always reached for a new spirit and aimed at a higher goal.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_106.wav|We've been courageous and determined, unafraid and bold.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_108.wav|I believe that the people you and I represent are ready to chart a new course.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_109.wav|They look to us to meet the great challenge, to reach beyond the commonplace and not fall short for lack of creativity or courage.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_110.wav|Someone you know has said that he who would have nothing to do with thorns must never attempt to gather flowers.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_111.wav|But we have much greatness before us.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_112.wav|We can restore our economic strength and build opportunities like none we've ever had before.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_113.wav|As Carl Sandberg said, all we need to begin with is a dream that we can do better than before.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_114.wav|All we need to have is faith and that dream will come true.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_115.wav|All we need to do is act and the time for action is now.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_001.wav|our assumptions about government and its place in our lives.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_002.wav|Out of that change has come great and robust growth in our confidence, our economy and our role in the world.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_003.wav|Tonight America is stronger because of the values that we hold dear.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_006.wav|And a great industrial giant is reborn.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_008.wav|For an America of wisdom that honors the family, knowing that as the family goes, so goes our civilization.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_010.wav|For an America of compassion that opens its heart to those who cry out for help.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_011.wav|We have begun well, but it's only a beginning.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_012.wav|We're not here to congratulate ourselves on what we have done, but to challenge ourselves to finish what has not yet been done.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_013.wav|Millions in our inner cities who long for real jobs, safe neighborhoods and schools that truly teach.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_014.wav|We're here to speak for the American farmer, the entrepreneur, and every worker in industries fighting a modernized and compete.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_016.wav|Proverbs tell us that without a vision, the people perish.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_018.wav|We honor the giants of our history not by going back, but forward to the dreams their vision foresaw.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_019.wav|My fellow citizens, this nation is poised for greatness.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_020.wav|The time has come to proceed toward a great new challenge, a second American revolution of hope and opportunity.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_021.wav|A revolution carrying us to new heights of progress by pushing back frontiers of knowledge and space.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_022.wav|The revolution of spirit that taps the soul of America, enabling us to summon greater strength than we've ever known.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_023.wav|And a revolution that carries beyond our shores, the golden promise of human freedom in a world at peace.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_024.wav|There are no constraints on the human mind, no walls around the human spirit, no barriers to our progress, except those we are ourselves erect.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_025.wav|Already pushing down tax rates has freed our economy to vault forward to record growth.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_026.wav|In Europe, they're calling it the American miracle.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_027.wav|Day by day, we are shattering accepted notions of what is possible.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_028.wav|When I was growing up, we failed to see how a new thing called radio would transform our marketplace.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_029.wav|Well, today, many have not yet seen how advances in technology are transforming our lives.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_030.wav|In the late 1950s, workers at the AT&T Concemic Conductor Plant in Pennsylvania produced five transistors a day for $7.5 a piece.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_031.wav|They now produce over a million for less than a penny a piece.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_033.wav|Our automobile industry is overhauled assembly lines, increased worker productivity, and is competitive once again.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_034.wav|We stand on the threshold of a great ability to produce more, do more, be more.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_035.wav|Our economy is not getting older and weaker.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_036.wav|It's getting younger and stronger.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_037.wav|It needs new challenge, greater freedom, and that word freedom is the key to the second American revolution that we mean to bring about.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_038.wav|Let us move together with an historic reform of tax simplification for fairness and growth.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_040.wav|We have cut tax rates by almost 25%.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_041.wav|Yet the tax system remains unfair and limits our potential for growth.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_042.wav|Exclusions and exemptions cause similar incomes to be taxed at different levels.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_043.wav|Low income families face steep tax barriers that make hard lives even harder.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_044.wav|The Treasury Department has produced an excellent reform plan whose principles will guide the final proposal that we will ask you to enact.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_045.wav|One thing that tax reform will not be is a tax increase in disguise.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_046.wav|We will reduce personal tax rates as low as possible by removing many tax preferences.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_047.wav|We will propose a top rate of no more than 35% and possibly lower.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_048.wav|And we will propose reducing corporate rates while maintaining incentives for capital formation.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_050.wav|And tonight, I am instructing Treasury Secretary James Baker,|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_051.wav|I have to get used to saying that, to begin working with congressional authors and committees for bipartisan legislation conforming to these principles.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_052.wav|We will call upon the American people for support and upon every man and woman in this chamber.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_054.wav|But a second American revolution must carry the promise of opportunity for all.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_055.wav|It is time to liberate the spirit of enterprise in the most distressed areas of our country.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_058.wav|This legislation is supported by a majority of you.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_060.wav|I know we agree that there must be no forgotten Americans.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_061.wav|Let us place new dreams in a million hearts and create a new generation of entrepreneurs by passing enterprise zones this year.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_062.wav|Pass our youth employment opportunity wage proposal.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_063.wav|We can help teenagers who have the highest unemployment rate find summer jobs so they can know the pride of work and have confidence in their futures.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_064.wav|We will continue to support the job training partnership act, which has a nearly two-thirds job placement rate.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_065.wav|Credits in education and healthcare vouchers will help working families shop for services that they need.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_066.wav|Our administration is already encouraging certain low-income public housing residents to own and manage their own dwellings.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_067.wav|It's time that all public housing residents have that opportunity of ownership.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_068.wav|But states and localities, many of which enjoy surpluses from the recovery, must not permit their tax and regulatory policies to stand as barriers to growth.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_069.wav|Let us resolve that we will stop spreading dependency and start spreading opportunity, that we will stop spreading bondage and start spreading freedom.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_070.wav|There are some who say that growth initiatives must await final action on deficit reductions.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_071.wav|For the best way to reduce deficits is through economic growth.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_072.wav|More jobs created and more people will be on payrolls paying taxes.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_073.wav|The best way to reduce government spending is to reduce the need for spending by increasing prosperity.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_075.wav|To move steadily toward a balanced budget, we must also lighten government's claim on our total economy.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_076.wav|We will not do this by raising taxes.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_077.wav|We must make sure that our economy grows faster than the growth in spending by the federal government.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_078.wav|In our fiscal year 1986 budget, overall government program spending will be frozen at the current level.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_079.wav|It must not be one dime higher than fiscal year 1985, and three points are key.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_080.wav|First, the social safety net for the elderly, the needy, the disabled and unemployed will be left intact.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_081.wav|Growth of our major health care programs, Medicare and Medicaid will be slow, but protections for the elderly and needy will be preserved.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_082.wav|Second, we must not relax our efforts to restore military strength just as we near our goal of a fully equipped trained and ready professional core.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_083.wav|National security is government's first responsibility.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_084.wav|So in past years, defense spending took about half the federal budget.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_085.wav|Today it takes less than a third.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_086.wav|We've already reduced our planned defense expenditures by nearly $100 billion over the past four years and reduced projected spending again this year.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_087.wav|You know, we only have a military industrial complex until a time of danger, and then it becomes the arsenal of democracy.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_088.wav|Peace and freedom.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_089.wav|Third, we must reduce or eliminate costly government subsidies.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_091.wav|It's time we ended this huge federal subsidy.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_092.wav|Yet I know from visiting farmers, many and great financial distress, that we need an orderly transition to a market-oriented farm economy.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_093.wav|We can help farmers best, not by expanding federal payments, but by making fundamental reforms, keeping interest rates heading down.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_094.wav|We are moving ahead with grace commission reforms to eliminate waste and improve government's management practices.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_095.wav|In the long run, we must protect the taxpayers from government.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_097.wav|To veto individual items in appropriation bills, Senator Mattingley has introduced a bill permitting a two-year trial run of the line item veto.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_098.wav|I hope you'll pass and send that legislation to my desk, as brought us to a time of reckoning.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_099.wav|Hours is but a moment in history, but one moment of courage, idealism, and bipartisan unity can change American history forever.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_100.wav|Sound monetary policy is key to long-running economic strength and stability.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_103.wav|In just one set of grant programs, we have reduced 905 pages of regulations to 31.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_104.wav|We seek to fully deregulate natural gas to bring on new supplies and bring us closer to energy independence.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_105.wav|Consistent with safety standards, we will continue removing restraints on the bus and railroad industries.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_107.wav|Every dollar the federal government does not take from us.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_108.wav|Every decision it does not make for us will make our economy stronger, our lives more abundant, our future more free.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_109.wav|We'll push on to new possibilities not only on Earth, but in the next frontier of space.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_110.wav|Despite budget restraints, we will seek record funding for research and development.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_111.wav|We've seen the success of the space shuttle.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_113.wav|In the zero gravity of space, we could manufacture in 30 days life-saving medicines it would take 30 years to make on Earth.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_115.wav|As we do, all this will continue to protect our natural resources.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_118.wav|We see signs of renewal in increased attendance in places of worship, renewed optimism and faith in our future.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_119.wav|Love of country rediscovered by our young who are leading the way.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_120.wav|We've rediscovered that work is good in and of itself, that it enables us to create and contribute, no matter how seemingly humble our jobs.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_122.wav|To millions volunteering time, corporations adopting schools and communities putting together to help the neediest among us at home.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_123.wav|We have re-found our values.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_124.wav|Private sector initiatives are crucial to our future.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_125.wav|I thank the Congress for passing equal access legislation giving religious groups the same right to use classrooms after school that other groups enjoy.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_126.wav|But no citizen need tremble, no the world's shutter.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_128.wav|Abortion is either the taking of a human life or it isn't.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_129.wav|And if it is, and medical technology is increasingly showing it is, it must be stopped.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_130.wav|It is terrible irony that while some turn to abortion so many others who cannot become parents cry out for children to adopt.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_131.wav|We have room for these children.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_132.wav|We can fill the cradles of those who want a child to love.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_133.wav|And tonight I ask you in the Congress to move this year on legislation to protect.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_134.wav|We're returning to excellence and again the heroes are our people not government.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_135.wav|We're stressing basics of discipline, rigorous testing and homework while helping children become computer smart as well.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_136.wav|For 20 years, scholastic aptitude test scores of our high school students went down.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_137.wav|But now they have gone up two of the last three years.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_139.wav|None has more threatened our sense of national well-being than the explosion of violent crime.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_140.wav|One does not have to be attacked to be a victim.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_141.wav|The woman who has run to her car after shopping at night is a victim.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_142.wav|The couple draping their door with locks and chains are victims.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_143.wav|As is the tired, decent, cleaning woman who can't ride a subway home without being afraid.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_144.wav|We do not seek to violate the rights of defendants.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_146.wav|But we must do more.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_147.wav|I urge the House to follow the Senate and enact proposals permitting use of all reliable evidence that police officers acquire in good faith.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_149.wav|It's time we restored domestic tranquility and we mean to do just that.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_150.wav|Just as we're positioned as never before to secure justice in our economy, we're poised as never before to create a safer, freer, more peaceful world.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_151.wav|Our alliances are stronger than ever.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_152.wav|Our economy is stronger than ever.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_153.wav|We have resumed our historic role as a leader of the free world and all of these together are a great force for peace.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_155.wav|Now our determination to maintain a strong defense has influenced the Soviet Union to return to the bargaining table.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_156.wav|Our negotiators must be able to go to that table with the united support of the American people.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_160.wav|Well, I believe there's a better way of eliminating the threat of nuclear war.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_161.wav|It is a strategic defense initiative aimed ultimately at finding a non-nuclear defense against ballistic missiles.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_162.wav|It's the most hopeful possibility of the nuclear age, but it's not very well understood.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_163.wav|Some say it will bring war to the heavens, but its purpose is to deter war in the heavens and on earth.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_164.wav|Now some say the research would be expensive, perhaps, but it could save millions of lives, indeed humanity itself.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_165.wav|Some say if we build such a system, the Soviets will build a defense system of their own.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_167.wav|And finally, some say the research will take a long time.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_169.wav|And tonight, we declare a new to our fellow citizens of the world.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_170.wav|Freedom is not the sole prerogative of a chosen few.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_171.wav|It is the universal right of all God's children.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_172.wav|Look to where peace and prosperity flourish today.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_173.wav|It is in homes that freedom built.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_175.wav|Our mission is to nourish and defend freedom and democracy, and to communicate these ideals everywhere we can.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_176.wav|America's economic success is freedom's success.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_177.wav|It can be repeated a hundred times in a hundred different nations.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_178.wav|Many countries in East Asia and the Pacific have few resources other than the enterprise of their own people.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_179.wav|But through low tax rates and free markets, they've soared ahead of centralized economies.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_180.wav|And now China is opening up its economy to meet its needs.|1|74

wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_001.wav|I fell in Americans, there's an old saying we've all heard a thousand times about the weather and how everyone talks about it, but no one does anything about it.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_002.wav|Well, many of you must be feeling that way about the present state of our economy.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_004.wav|Believe me, if some of you are confused, I can understand why.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_006.wav|I know you've read and heard on the news a variety of statements attributed to various quote authoritative government sources who prefer not to have their names used unquote.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_007.wav|Well, you know my name, and I think I'm an authoritative source on this since I'm right in the middle of what's going on here.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_008.wav|So I'd like to set the record straight on a few of the things that you might have heard lately.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_009.wav|I'm sure you've heard that we're proposing the largest single tax increase in history.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_010.wav|The truth is we're proposing nothing of the kind.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_012.wav|Well, don't you believe that one either?|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_013.wav|Yes, there is a tax bill before the Congress tied to a program of further cuts in spending.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_014.wav|It is not, however, the greatest single tax increase in history.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_016.wav|Now you may have heard that some special interest opposed this bill, and that's right.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_019.wav|Why then do I support it?|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_020.wav|I supported because it's right for America.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_021.wav|I supported because it's fair.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_022.wav|I supported because it will when combined with our cuts in government spending, reduce interest rates, and put more Americans back to work again.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_023.wav|Now you'll recall that when our administration came into office a year ago last January, we announced a plan for economic recovery.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_024.wav|Recovery from what?|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_025.wav|From a 1980 recession that saw inflation in double-digit figures for the second year in a row, it was 12.4% when we arrived.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_026.wav|Interest rates had gone into outer space.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_027.wav|They were at the highest they'd been in 100 years with a prime rate that hit 21.5%.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_029.wav|I went to those areas.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_031.wav|The cost of government was increasing at a rate of 17% a year.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_032.wav|There was little we could do about the budget already in place, but we could do something about the one that had been proposed for the fiscal year beginning in October of our first year.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_034.wav|I also said that one area of government spending could not be reduced, but must instead be increased.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_035.wav|That was the spending necessary to restore our nation's defenses, which had been allowed to deteriorate to a dangerous degree in the preceding four years.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_036.wav|Interest rates continued high, as the months went by, an unemployment increase, particularly in the automobile industry, and housing construction.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_037.wav|Few could or would afford the high interest rates for home mortgages, or installment buying of an automobile.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_038.wav|Meantime, we were putting our economic recovery program in place.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_039.wav|It wasn't easy.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_040.wav|We didn't get all the cuts we wanted, and we got some tax measures.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_041.wav|We didn't want, but we were charting a complete turnaround in government policy, and we did get the major part of what we proposed.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_042.wav|The Congress mandated spending cuts of $130 billion over three years, and adopted the biggest tax cut in history.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_043.wav|Now, this too was to be implemented over a three-year period.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_044.wav|It began with a 5% cut in the personal income tax beginning October 1, 1981.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_045.wav|Then a 10% cut this last July, and another scheduled for July 1, 1983.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_046.wav|These will be followed by indexing of the tax brackets, so workers getting cost of living pay raises won't be moved up into higher brackets.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_047.wav|We have to realize inflation itself is a tax, government profits by inflation, but indexing will put a stop to that.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_049.wav|Some who supported us on the spending cuts were fearful about cutting taxes in view of the continuing budget deficits.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_051.wav|Now, it's only been 10 months since the first phase of our program went into effect.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_052.wav|As I said earlier, there are those who say it's been tried and it failed.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_053.wav|Well, as Al Smith used to say, let's look at the record.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_054.wav|Start with interest rates, the basic cause of the present recession.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_055.wav|The prime rate was, as I said, 21.5%.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_056.wav|Well, last week it was 14.5%, and as of today, three major banks have lowered it to 14%.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_057.wav|Last week, 98 Treasury bills were paying less than 9% interest.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_058.wav|One year ago, they were paying 15.5%.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_059.wav|That double-digit inflation, 12.4%, has been cut in half for the last six months.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_060.wav|Real earnings are at last increasing for the first time in quite a long time.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_061.wav|Personal savings, which trended downwards throughout the last decade, are increasing.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_062.wav|This means more money in the pool of investment capital.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_063.wav|This will help further reduce interest rates.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_064.wav|All of this, in only 10 months, hardly looks like a program that failed to me.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_065.wav|Oh, yes, I failed to mention that in the quarter just ended, there was an increase in economic growth.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_066.wav|The first such increase in a long time.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_067.wav|Our biggest problem, the last one to be solved in every recession, is unemployment.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_068.wav|I understand how tough it is for those who are waiting for the jobs that come with recovery.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_069.wav|We can have no rest until our neighbors, our fellow citizens who want to work, are able once again to find jobs.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_070.wav|Again, let me say, the main obstacle to their doing so is continued high interest rates.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_071.wav|Those rates should be lower now than they are with the success we've had in reducing inflation.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_072.wav|But part of the problem is psychological.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_073.wav|A pessimism in the money markets that we won't stay the course and continue lowering the cost of government.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_074.wav|The projected increase in budget deficits has added to that pessimism and fear.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_075.wav|And this brings us back to that so-called greatest tax increase in history and the budget proposals now before the Congress.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_076.wav|When I submitted the 1983 budget to the Congress in February, it contained very significant spending cuts on top of those we obtained last year.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_077.wav|This time, however, we couldn't get the support we had last year.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_078.wav|Some who had not been happy about the tax cuts then were now insisting we must have additional tax revenues.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_079.wav|In fact, they wanted to cancel the reduction scheduled for next July and cancel the indexing of tax brackets.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_080.wav|Others proposed tax increases, mounting to about $150 billion over a three-year period.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_081.wav|On top of this, there was resistance to the spending reductions we asked for and even attempts to eliminate some of last year's cuts so as to actually increase spending.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_082.wav|For many months now, we've been working to get a compromised budget that would further reduce spending and thus reduce the deficits.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_083.wav|We also have stood firm on retaining the tax cuts already in place because, as I said, they are essential to restoring the economy.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_084.wav|We did, however, agree to limited revenue increases so long as they didn't harm the incentive features of our economic recovery program.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_086.wav|Well, weeks and weeks of negotiations resulted in a congressional budget resolution combining revenue increases and further spending reductions.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_088.wav|Now, as you can see, that figures out to about a three-to-one ratio.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_089.wav|$3 less in spending outlays for each $1 of increased revenue.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_090.wav|This compromise adds up to a total over three years of a $380 billion reduction in the budget deficits.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_092.wav|Now, let me take that $99 billion tax program apart and you decide whether it's the biggest tax increase in history.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_094.wav|Not all of you who are paying your tax, simple fairness says we should collect from those who are free loading.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_096.wav|Some who are financially well able to pay their share.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_097.wav|Now, this is also a matter of simple fairness.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_098.wav|So, more than 80 percent of the tax bill is not new tax at all, but is better collecting and correcting of flaws in the system.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_100.wav|There is an excise tax on cigarettes, another on telephones.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_101.wav|Well, for people who smoke a pack a day, that tax will mean an increase of only $2.40 a month.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_102.wav|The telephone tax increase is only about $0.54 a month for the average household.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_103.wav|Right now, the tax reduction that we passed last year is saving the average family about $400 per year.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_104.wav|Next year, even after this new tax bill is passed, the savings will almost double.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_105.wav|They'll go to $788.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_106.wav|And here's what the totals look like.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_107.wav|The new tax reform will raise in three years, about, as I say, $99 billion.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_108.wav|In the same three years, as I said a moment ago, our tax cut program, even after this increase, will save you $335 billion.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_109.wav|Within the new bill, there has, of course, been disagreement over some of the specific provisions.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_111.wav|Many senior citizens have been led to believe this is a new tax added on top of the present income tax.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_112.wav|Well, there is no truth whatsoever to that.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_113.wav|We've found that while the overwhelming majority of Americans faithfully report income from interest in dividends and pay taxes on it, some do not.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_114.wav|It's one of the significant areas of non-compliance and is costing the government about $9 billion a year.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_117.wav|And there will be an exemption for all interest payments of $150 or less.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_118.wav|The only people whose taxes will be increased by this withholding are those who presently are evading their fair share of the tax burden.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_119.wav|Once again, we're striving to see that all taxpayers are treated fairly.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_120.wav|Now this withholding will go into effect next July, not this January 1st as was earlier reported.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_122.wav|If we had done nothing, it would have risen to almost 25%.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_124.wav|Make no mistake about it.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_125.wav|This whole package is a compromise.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_126.wav|I had to swallow hard to agree to any revenue increase.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_127.wav|But there are two sides to a compromise.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_128.wav|Those who supported the increased revenues swallowed hard to accept $280 billion in outlay cuts.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_129.wav|Others have accepted specific provisions with regard to taxes or spending cuts, which they opposed.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_130.wav|There's a provision in the bill for extended unemployment payments in states particularly hard hit by unemployment.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_131.wav|If this gives up their benefits by the end of March.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_132.wav|I repeat, much of this bill will make our tax system more fair for every American, especially those in lower income brackets.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_133.wav|I'm still dedicated to reducing the level of spending until it's within our income.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_134.wav|And I still want to see the base of the economy broadened so that the individual's tax burden can be further reduced.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_135.wav|Over the years, growth in government and deficit spending have been built into our system.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_136.wav|How to be nice if we could just cut that out of our system with a single sharp slice.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_137.wav|That, however, can't be done without bringing great hardship down on many of our less fortunate neighbors who are not in a position to provide for themselves.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_138.wav|And none of us wants that.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_139.wav|Our effort to restore fiscal integrity and common sense to the federal establishment isn't limited to the budget cuts and tax policy.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_140.wav|Vice President Bush heads up a task force that's been reviewing excessive regulations.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_142.wav|Our inspectors general have been mobilized in with task force aimed at ferriting out waste and fraud.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_143.wav|They've conducted tens of thousands of credits, secured thousands of indictments resulting in many convictions.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_144.wav|In the first six months of fiscal 1982 alone, they found $5.8 billion of savings and improved use of funds.|1|71

wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_151.wav|We need the bipartisan comprehensive package of revenue increases and spending cuts.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_152.wav|Now before the Congress, we need it to be passed.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_153.wav|We're not proposing a quick fix, an artificial stimulus to the economy, such as we've seen in the several recessions in recent years.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_154.wav|The present recession is bottoming out without resorting to quick fixes.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_156.wav|It may not be easy, but it's the best way, the only way to reel and lasting prosperity for all our people.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_157.wav|Think of it, we've only had one balanced budget in the last 20 years.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_158.wav|Let's look forward to the day when we begin making payments to reduce the national debt instead of turning it all over to our children.|1|71

wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_161.wav|You can help again, whether you're a Republican, a Democrat, or an independent, by letting them know that you want it continued.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_162.wav|Letting them know that you understand that this legislation is a price worth paying for lower interest rates, economic recovery, and more jobs.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_165.wav|We're within sight of the safe port of economic recovery.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_166.wav|Do we make port or go a ground on the shores of selfishness, partisanship, and just plain bullheadedness?|1|71

wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_007.wav|We stand on a lonely wind-sweat point on the northern shore of France.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_010.wav|Their mission was one of the most difficult and daring of the invasion to climb these sheer and desolate cliffs and take out the enemy guns.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_011.wav|The Allies had been told that some of the mightiest of these guns were here and they would be trained on the beaches to stop the Allied advance.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_012.wav|The Rangers looked up and saw the enemy soldiers, the edge of the cliffs shooting down at them with machine guns and throwing grenades and the American Rangers began to climb.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_013.wav|They shot rope ladders over the face of these cliffs and began to pull themselves up.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_014.wav|When one Ranger fell, another would take his place.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_015.wav|When one rope was cut, a Ranger would grab another and begin his climb again.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_016.wav|They climbed, shot back and held their footing.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_018.wav|225 came here.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_019.wav|After two days of fighting, only 90 could steal bear arms.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_021.wav|These are the champions who helped free a continent.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_022.wav|These are the heroes who helped end a war.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_023.wav|Gentlemen, I look at you and I think of the words of Stephen Spender's poem.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_024.wav|You were men who in your quote, lives fought for life and left the vivid air signed with your honor.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_025.wav|I think I know what you may be thinking right now.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_026.wav|Thinking we were just part of a bigger effort, everyone was brave that day.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_027.wav|Well, everyone was.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_028.wav|You remember the story of Bill Millen of the 51st Highlanders?|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_029.wav|40 years ago today, British troops were pinned down near a bridge, waiting desperately for help.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_030.wav|Suddenly they heard the sound of bagpipes and some thought they were dreaming.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_031.wav|Well, they weren't.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_032.wav|They looked up and saw Bill Millen with his bagpipes leading the reinforcements and ignoring the smack of the ground around him.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_033.wav|Lord Love it was with him.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_034.wav|Lord Love it of Scotland who calmly announced when he got to the bridge.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_035.wav|Sorry, I'm a few minutes late as if he'd been delayed by a traffic jam.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_036.wav|When in truth he'd just come from the bloody fighting on sword beach which he and his men had just taken.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_037.wav|There was the impossible valor of the Poles who threw themselves between the enemy and the rest of Europe as the invasion took hold.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_038.wav|And the unsurpassed courage of the Canadians who had already seen the horrors of war on this coast.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_039.wav|They knew what awaited them there, but they would not be deterred.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_040.wav|And once they hit Juno Beach, they never looked back.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_041.wav|All of these men were part of a roll call of honor, with names that spoke of a pride as bright as the colors they bore.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_043.wav|Forty summers have passed since the battle that you fought here.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_044.wav|You were young the day you took these cliffs.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_045.wav|Some of you were hardly more than boys with the deepest joys of life before you, yet you risked everything here.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_047.wav|Why did you do it?|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_048.wav|Well, what impelled you to put aside the instinct for self-preservation and risk your lives to take these cliffs?|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_049.wav|What inspired all the men of the armies that met here?|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_050.wav|We look at you and somehow we know the answer.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_051.wav|It was faith and belief.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_052.wav|It was loyalty and love.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_053.wav|The men of Normandy had faith that what they were doing was right.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_054.wav|Faith that they fought for all humanity.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_055.wav|Faith that deep knowledge and pray,|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_057.wav|You were here to liberate not to conquer, and so you and those others did not doubt your cause, and you were right not to doubt.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_058.wav|You all knew that some things are worth dying for.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_060.wav|All of you loved liberty.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_061.wav|All of you were willing to fight tyranny, and you knew the people of your countries were behind you.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_062.wav|The Americans who fought here that morning knew word of the invasion was spreading through the darkness back home.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_063.wav|They fought or felt in their hearts though they couldn't know, in fact, that in Georgia they were filling the churches at 4 a.m.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_064.wav|In Kansas they were kneeling on their porches and praying, and in Philadelphia they were ringing the liberty bell.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_065.wav|Something else helped the men of D.D.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_066.wav|The rock hard belief that providence would have a great hand in the events that would unfold here, that God was an ally in this great cause.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_067.wav|And so the night before the invasion, when Colonel Wouverton asked his parachute troops to kneel with him in prayer.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_069.wav|Also that night General Matthew Richway on his cot, listening in the darkness for the promise God made to Joshua,|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_070.wav|I will not fail thee nor forsake thee.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_071.wav|These are the things that impelled him.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_072.wav|These are the things that shaped the unity of the allies.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_073.wav|When the war was over, there were lives to be rebuilt and governments to be returned to the people.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_074.wav|There were nations to be reborn.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_075.wav|Above all there was a new peace to be assured.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_077.wav|They rebuilt a new Europe together.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_078.wav|There was first a great reconciliation among those who had been enemies, all of whom it suffered so greatly.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_079.wav|The United States did its part, creating the Marshall Plan to help rebuild our allies and our former enemies.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_081.wav|In spite of our great efforts and successes, not all that followed the end of the war was happier planned.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_082.wav|Some liberated countries were lost.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_083.wav|The great sadness of this loss echoes down to our own time and the streets of Warsaw, Prague and East Berlin.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_084.wav|The Soviet troops that came to the center of this continent did not leave when peace came.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_085.wav|They're still there, uninvited, unwanted, unyielding, almost 40 years after the war.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_086.wav|Because of this, allied forces still stand on this continent.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_087.wav|Today, as 40 years ago, our armies are here for only one purpose to protect and defend democracy.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_088.wav|The only territories we hold are memorials like this one and graveyards where our heroes rest.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_089.wav|We in America have learned bitter lessons from two world wars.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_090.wav|It is better to be here ready to protect the peace than to take blind shelter across the sea, rushing to respond only after freedom is lost.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_091.wav|We've learned that isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical governments within expansionist intent.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_093.wav|In truth, there is no reconciliation we would welcome more than a reconciliation with the Soviet Union.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_094.wav|So together, we can listen less than the risk of war now and forever.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_095.wav|It's fitting to remember, here, the great loss is also suffered by the Russian people during World War II.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_096.wav|20 million perished, a terrible price that testifies to all the world and necessity of ending war.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_097.wav|I tell you from my heart that we in the United States do not want war.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_098.wav|We want a wipe from the face of the earth, the terrible weapons that man now has in his hands.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_099.wav|And I tell you, we are ready to seize that beachhead.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_101.wav|There must be a changing there that will allow us to turn our hope into action.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_102.wav|We will pray forever that someday that changing will come.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_104.wav|We are bound today by what bound us 40 years ago, the same loyalties, traditions, and beliefs.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_105.wav|We are bound by reality.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_107.wav|We were with you then, we are with you now.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_108.wav|Your hopes are our hopes and your destiny is our destiny.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_109.wav|Here in this place where the West held together, let us make a vow to our dead.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_110.wav|Let us show them by our actions that we understand what they died for.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_111.wav|Let our actions say to them the words for which Matthew, Ridgeway listened,|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_112.wav|I will not fail thee nor forsake thee.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_114.wav|Thank you very much and God bless you all.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_001.wav|uh, governing mayor, deepkin, ladies and gentlemen,|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_002.wav|24 years ago, president, john f. kennedy, visited Berlin.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_004.wav|And today I myself make my second visit to speak in this place of freedom.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_006.wav|Perhaps the composer Paul Linky understood something about American presidents.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_007.wav|You see, like so many presidents before me,|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_008.wav|I come here today because wherever I go, whatever I do, ish habna kainan koffer in Berlin.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_009.wav|I understand that it is being seen and heard as well in the east.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_010.wav|To those listening throughout Eastern Europe, I extend my warmest greetings and the good will of the American people.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_011.wav|To those listening in East Berlin, a special word.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_012.wav|Although I cannot be with you, I address my remarks to you just as surely as to those standing here before me.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_015.wav|From the Baltic South, those barriers cut across Germany in a gash of barbed wire, concrete, dog runs and guard towers.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_016.wav|Farther south, there may be no visible, no obvious wall, but the remain armed guards and checkpoints all the same.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_017.wav|Still a restriction on the right to travel.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_018.wav|Still an instrument to impose upon ordinary men and women, the will of a totalitarian state.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_020.wav|Standing before the Brandenburg Gate, every man is a German separated from his fellow men.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_021.wav|Forced to look upon a scar.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_022.wav|President von Weitzacher has said the German question is open as long as the Brandenburg Gate is closed.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_024.wav|In this season of spring in 1945, the people of Berlin emerged from their air-raid shelters to find devastation.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_025.wav|Thousands of miles away, the people of the United States reached out to help.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_026.wav|And in 1947, Secretary of State, as you've been told, George Marshall announced the creation of what would become known as the Marshall Plan.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_028.wav|I saw a display commemorating this 40th anniversary of the Marshall Plan.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_029.wav|I was struck by a sawdust sign on a burnt-out gutted structure that was being rebuilt.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_031.wav|The sign read simply, the Marshall Plan is helping here to strengthen the free world.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_032.wav|A strong free world in the West, that dream became real.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_033.wav|Japan rose from ruin to become an economic giant.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_034.wav|Italy, France, Belgium, virtually every nation in Western Europe saw political and economic rebirth.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_035.wav|The European community was founded.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_036.wav|In West Germany and here in Berlin, there took place an economic miracle.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_038.wav|That just as truth can flourish only when the journalist is given freedom of speech.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_039.wav|So prosperity can come about only when the farmer and businessmen enjoy economic freedom.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_042.wav|The Soviets may have had other plans, but my friends there were a few things the Soviets didn't count on.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_045.wav|After these four decades then there stands before the entire world one great and inescapable conclusion.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_047.wav|Now the Soviets themselves may in a limited way be coming to understand the importance of freedom.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_057.wav|For many months, the Soviets refused to bargain in earnestness.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_061.wav|And entire class of nuclear weapons from the face of the earth.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_062.wav|As I speak, NATO ministers are meeting in Iceland to review the progress of our proposals for eliminating these weapons.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_063.wav|At the talks in Geneva, we have also proposed deep cuts in strategic offensive weapons.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_067.wav|By these means, we seek to increase the safety of Europe and all the world.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_068.wav|But we must remember a crucial fact.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_069.wav|East and West do not mistrust each other because we are armed.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_070.wav|But about liberty.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_071.wav|When President Kennedy spoke at the city hall those 24 years ago, freedom was encircled.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_072.wav|Berlin was under siege.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_073.wav|And today, despite all the pressures upon this city, Berlin stands secure in its liberty.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_074.wav|And freedom itself is transforming the globe.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_075.wav|In the Philippines, in South and Central America, democracy has been given a rebirth.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_076.wav|Throughout the Pacific, free markets are working miracle after miracle of economic growth.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_077.wav|In the industrialized nations, a technological revolution is taking place.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_078.wav|A revolution marked by rapid dramatic advances in computers and telecommunications.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_079.wav|In Europe, only one nation and those it controls refuse to join the community of freedom.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_080.wav|Yet in this age of redoubled economic growth, of information and innovation, the Soviet Union faces a choice.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_081.wav|It must make fundamental changes or it will become obsolete.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_083.wav|And surely there is no better place than Berlin, the meeting place of East and West, to make a start.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_084.wav|And full implementation of all parts of the four-power agreement of 1971.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_087.wav|And I invite Mr. Gorbachev, let us work to bring the eastern and western parts of the city closer together.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_089.wav|We look to the day when West Berlin can become one of the chief aviation hubs in all central Europe.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_090.wav|The United States is prepared to help bring international meetings to Berlin.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_091.wav|It would be only fitting for Berlin to serve as the site of United Nations meetings, or world conferences on human rights and arms control.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_092.wav|There is no better way to establish hope for the future than to enlighten young minds.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_093.wav|And we would be honored to sponsor summer youth exchanges, cultural events, and other programs for young Berliners from the East.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_094.wav|Our French and British friends, I'm certain, will do the same.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_095.wav|And it's my hope that an authority can be found in East Berlin to sponsor visits from young people of the Western sectors.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_097.wav|International sports competitions of all kinds could take place in both parts of this city.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_098.wav|And what better way to demonstrate to the world the openness of this city than to offer in some future year?|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_099.wav|You, Berliners, have built a great city.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_100.wav|You've done so in spite of threats.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_101.wav|The Soviet attempts to impose the Eastmark, the blockade.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_102.wav|Today, the city thrives in spite of the challenges implicit in the very presence of this wall.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_103.wav|What keeps you here?|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_104.wav|Certainly, there's a great deal to be said for your fortitude, for your defiant courage, but I believe there's something deeper.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_105.wav|Something that involves Berlin's whole look and feel and way of life.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_106.wav|Not mere sentiment.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_107.wav|No one could live long in Berlin without being completely disabused of illusions.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_108.wav|Something instead that has seen the difficulties of life in Berlin but chose to accept them.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_111.wav|In a word, I would submit that what keeps you in Berlin is love.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_112.wav|Perhaps this gets to the root of the matter, to the most fundamental distinction of all between East and West.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_114.wav|The totalitarian world finds even symbols of love and of worship and affront.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_116.wav|Virtually ever since, the authorities have been working to correct what they view as the tower's one major flaw.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_119.wav|Quote, this wall will fall, beliefs become reality.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_121.wav|And I would like, for I close to say one word.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_123.wav|I wonder if they have ever asked themselves that if they should have the kind of government they apparently seek.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_001.wav|just a speaker, president, distinguished members of the house and senate.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_002.wav|When we first met here seven years ago, many of us for the first time, it was with the hope of beginning something new for America.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_003.wav|Me here tonight in this historic chamber to continue that work.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_004.wav|If anyone expects just a proud recitation of the accomplishments of my administration, I say let's leave that to history.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_005.wav|We're not finished yet.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_008.wav|Do not overdo it.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_011.wav|All of this was made possible by an idea I spoke of when Mr. Gorbachev was here.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_013.wav|The revolutionary notion that the people grant government its rights and not the other way around.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_016.wav|But what is best, there are no republicans, no Democrats, just Americans.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_017.wav|Yes, we will have our differences but let us always remember what unites us far outweighs whatever divides us.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_018.wav|Those who sent us here to serve them, the millions of Americans watching and listening tonight expect this of us.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_019.wav|Let's prove to them and to ourselves that democracy works even in an election year.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_021.wav|A revolution of compassion that led to private sector initiatives and a 77% increase in charitable giving.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_022.wav|A revolution that at a critical moment in world history reclaimed and restored the American dream.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_023.wav|In international relations too there's only one description for what together we have achieved.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_024.wav|A complete turnabout, a revolution seven years ago, America was weak and freedom everywhere, was under siege.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_025.wav|Today America is strong and democracy is everywhere on the move.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_026.wav|From Central America to East Asia, ideas like free markets and democratic reforms and human rights are taking hold.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_028.wav|I speak of the startling hope of giving our children a future free of both totalitarianism and nuclear terror.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_029.wav|Tonight then we're strong, prosperous, at peace and we are free.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_031.wav|Steps we can take this year to keep our economy strong and growing, to give our children a future of low inflation and full employment.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_032.wav|Second, let's check our progress in attacking social problems where important gains have been made but which still need critical attention.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_033.wav|I mean schools that work, economic independence for the poor, restoring respect for family life and family values.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_034.wav|Our third objective tonight is global, continuing the exciting economic and democratic revolutions we've seen around the world.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_035.wav|Fourth and finally our nation has remained at peace for nearly a decade and a half as we move toward our goals of world prosperity and world freedom.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_037.wav|You see my thinking on the next year is quite simple.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_038.wav|Let's make this the best of eight.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_042.wav|Where others seek to throw up barriers, we seek to bring them down, where others take counsel of their fears, we follow our hopes.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_043.wav|Yes, we Americans like the future and like making the most of it.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_045.wav|We have had a federal, a balanced budget only eight times in the last 57 years.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_046.wav|For the first time in 14 years, the federal government spent less in real terms last year than the year before.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_047.wav|We took 73 billion dollars off last year's deficit compared to the year before.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_050.wav|But at last, there is agreement that we can't spend ourselves rich.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_051.wav|Our recent budget agreement designed to reduce federal deficits by 76 billion dollars over the next two years builds on this consensus.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_052.wav|But this agreement must be adhered to without slipping into the errors of the past.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_053.wav|More broken promises and more unchecked spending.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_054.wav|As I indicated in my first state of the union, what ails us can be simply put.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_056.wav|Something American families do and the federal government can't has caused crisis after crisis in this city.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_058.wav|Mr. President,|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_059.wav|I will say to you tonight what I've said before and will continue to say the budget process has broken down.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_060.wav|It needs a drastic overhaul.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_062.wav|I know I'm echoing what you here in the Congress have said because you suffered so directly.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_064.wav|Last year of the 13 appropriations bills due by October 1st, none of them made it.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_066.wav|That was 1186 pages long weighing 15 pounds.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_067.wav|And the long-term continuing resolution, you had three hours.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_068.wav|Yes, three hours to consider each.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_069.wav|And it took 300 people, my office of management and budget, just to read the bill so the government wouldn't shut down.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_071.wav|13 individual bills on time and fully reviewed by Congress.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_074.wav|Most of you in this chamber didn't know what was in this catch-all bill and report.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_075.wav|Over the past few weeks we've all learned what was tucked away behind a little comma here and there.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_078.wav|I won't even touch that.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_079.wav|So tonight I offer you this challenge.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_080.wav|In 30 days I will send back to you those items as decisions which if I had the authority to line them out I would do so.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_082.wav|By acting and approving this plan you have the opportunity to override a congressional process that is out of control.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_083.wav|There is another vital reform.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_084.wav|Yes, Graham Rudman Hollings has been profoundly helpful but let us take its goal of a balanced budget and make it permanent.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_086.wav|Let's ensure that the federal government never again legislates against the family and the home.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_088.wav|Not just in this administration but in future all future administrations.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_091.wav|There's a lesson here that we all should write on the blackboard a hundred times.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_092.wav|In a child's education money can never take the place of basics like discipline hard work and yes homework.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_094.wav|How can we help?|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_096.wav|Today the federal government has 59 major welfare programs and spends more than a hundred billion dollars a year on.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_097.wav|What is all this money done?|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_098.wav|Well too often it is only made poverty harder to escape federal welfare programs have created a massive social problem with the best of intentions.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_099.wav|Government created a poverty trap that wrecks havoc on the very support system the poor need most to lift themselves out of poverty the family.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_100.wav|Dependency has become the one enduring heirloom passed from one generation to the next of too many fragmented families.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_101.wav|It's time this may be the most radical thing I've said in seven years in office it's time for Washington to show a little humility.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_105.wav|And now let me turn to three other matters vital to family values and the quality of family life.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_106.wav|The first is an untold American success story.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_107.wav|Recently we released our annual survey of what graduating high school seniors have to say about drugs.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_108.wav|Cocaine use is declining and marijuana use was the lowest since surveying began.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_111.wav|She has helped so many of our young people to say no to drugs.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_116.wav|The Congress opens its proceedings each day as does the Supreme Court with an acknowledgement of the Supreme being.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_117.wav|Yet we are denied the right to set aside in our schools a moment each day for those who wish to pray.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_120.wav|Our policies consistently receive the strongest support of the late congressman Dan Daniel of Virginia.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_121.wav|I'm sure all of you join me in expressing heartfelt condolences on his passing.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_122.wav|One of the greatest contributions the United States can make to the world is to promote freedom as the key to economic growth.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_124.wav|We should always remember protectionism is destructionism.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_125.wav|America's jobs America's growth America's future depend on trade.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_126.wav|Trade that is free of growing global economy and an expanding cycle of prosperity that reaches to all the free nations of this earth.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_130.wav|This global democratic revolution has removed the specter so frightening a decade ago of democracy doomed to permanent minority status in the world.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_131.wav|In South and Central America only a third of the people enjoyed democratic rule in 1976.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_133.wav|In Nicaragua the struggle has extra meaning because that nation is so near our own borders.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_135.wav|Yet even as these plans are made the Sandinista regime knows the tide is turning and the cause of Nicaraguan freedom is riding its crest.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_137.wav|The focus is on the Sandinistas their promises and their actions.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_139.wav|The Sandinistas again have promised reforms their challenge is to take irreversible steps toward democracy.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_140.wav|On Wednesday my request to sustain the freedom fighters will be submitted which reflects our mutual desire for peace freedom and democracy in Nicaragua.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_142.wav|We support the Mujahideen there can be no settlement unless all Soviet troops are removed but not just Nicaragua or Afghanistan.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_002.wav|Mr. President, distinguished members of the Congress honored guests and fellow citizens.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_004.wav|That's a lot of reports, but there's no shortage of new things to say about the State of the Union.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_007.wav|As we gather here tonight, the state of our union is strong, but our economy is troubled.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_009.wav|We must all do everything in our power to bring their ordeal to an end.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_011.wav|We have a long way to go.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_012.wav|But thanks to the courage, patience and strength of our people, America is on the mend.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_013.wav|It involves many members of this body.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_014.wav|Just 10 days ago, after months of debate and deadlock, the bipartisan commission on social security accomplished the seemingly impossible.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_015.wav|Social security, as some of us had warned for so long, faced disaster.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_016.wav|I myself have been talking about this problem for almost 30 years.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_017.wav|As 1983 began, the system stood in the brink of bankruptcy, a double victim of our economic ideals.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_018.wav|First, a decade of rampant inflation drained its reserves as we tried to protect beneficiaries from the spiraling cost of living.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_021.wav|Well, sometimes, even here in Washington, the cynics are wrong.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_022.wav|Through compromise and cooperation, the members of the commission overcame their differences and achieved a fair, workable plan.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_023.wav|They prove that when it comes to the national welfare, Americans can still pull together for the common good.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_024.wav|I'm especially pleased to join with the speaker and the Senate Majority Leader in urging the Congress to enact this plan by Easter.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_025.wav|There are elements in it, of course, that none of us prefers, but taken together, it performs a package that all of us can support.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_027.wav|But it imposes an undue burden on none.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_028.wav|And in supporting it, we keep an important pledge to the American people.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_029.wav|The integrity of the social security system will be preserved, and no one's payments will be reduced.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_030.wav|The commission's plan will do the job.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_031.wav|Indeed, it must do the job.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_032.wav|We owe it to today's older Americans and today's younger workers.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_035.wav|Throughout the world, he said, change is the order of the day.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_039.wav|The problems we inherited were far worse than most inside and out of government had expected.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_040.wav|The recession was deeper than most inside and out of government had predicted.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_041.wav|Curing those problems has taken more time and a higher toll than any of us wanted.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_042.wav|Unemployment is far too high.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_047.wav|Leaders have started to realize that double-digit inflation is no longer a way of life.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_048.wav|I misspoke there I should have said lenders, so interest rates have tumbled, paving the way for recovery in vital industries like housing and autos.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_049.wav|The early evidence of that recovery has started coming in.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_052.wav|But our confidence must also be tempered by realism and patience.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_053.wav|Quick fixes and artificial stimulants repeatedly applied over decades are what brought us the inflationary disorders that we've now paid such a heavy price to cure.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_054.wav|The permanent recovery and employment, production and investment we seek won't come in a sharp short spur.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_055.wav|It'll build carefully, insteadly in the months and years ahead.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_057.wav|The federal budget is both a symptom and a cause of our economic problems.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_058.wav|Unless we reduce the dangerous growth rate in government spending, we could face the progress or prospect of sluggish economic growth into the indefinite future.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_059.wav|Failure to cope with this problem now could mean as much as a trillion dollars more in national debt in the next four years alone.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_060.wav|That would average $4,300 in additional debt for every man, woman, child and baby in our nation.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_061.wav|To assure and sustain recovery, we must continue getting runaway spending under control to bring those deficits down.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_062.wav|If we don't, the recovery will be too short.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_063.wav|Unemployment will remain too high and we will leave an unconscionable burden of national debt for our children.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_064.wav|That we must not do.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_065.wav|Let's be clear about where the deficit problem comes from.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_066.wav|Contrary to the drumbeat we've been hearing for the last few months, the deficits we face are not rooted in defense spending.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_067.wav|Taken as a percentage of the gross national product, our defense spending happens to be only about four-fifths of what it was in 1970.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_068.wav|Nor is the deficit as some would have it rooted in tax cuts.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_069.wav|Even with our tax cuts, taxes as a fraction of gross national product remained about the same as they were in 1970.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_070.wav|The fact is our deficits come from the uncontrolled growth of the budget for domestic spending.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_073.wav|The deficit problem is a clear and present danger to the basic health of our republic.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_074.wav|We need a plan to overcome this danger, a plan based on these principles.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_075.wav|It must be bipartisan.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_076.wav|Concoring the deficits and putting the government's house in order will require the best efforts of all of us.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_077.wav|It must be fair.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_078.wav|Just as all will share in the benefits that will come from recovery, all would share fairly in the burden of transition.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_079.wav|It must be prudent.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_080.wav|The strength of our national defense must be restored so that we can pursue prosperity and peace and freedom while maintaining our commitment to the truly needy.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_081.wav|And finally, it must be realistic.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_082.wav|We can't rely on hope alone.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_083.wav|With these guiding principles in mind, let me outline a four-part plan to increase economic growth and reduce deficits.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_084.wav|First, in my budget message, I will recommend a federal spending freeze.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_085.wav|I know there's a strong medicine, but so far we have only cut the rate of increase in federal spending.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_086.wav|The government has continued to spend more money each year, though not as much more as it did in the past.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_087.wav|Taken as a whole, the budget I'm producing or proposing for the next fiscal year will increase no more than the rate of inflation.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_088.wav|In other words, the federal government will hold the line on real spending.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_089.wav|That's far less than many American families have had to do in these difficult times.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_090.wav|Social Security Commission be applied to other government-related retirement programs.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_093.wav|Second, I will ask the Congress to adopt specific measures to control the growth of the so-called uncontrollable spending programs.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_094.wav|These are the automatic spending programs, such as food stamps, that cannot be simply frozen and that have grown by over 400 percent since 1970.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_095.wav|They are the largest single cause of the built-in or structural deficit problem.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_096.wav|Our standard here will be fairness.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_098.wav|And I'm sorry to say there's a lot of it out there.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_099.wav|In the food stamp program in the home last year, we identified almost 1.1 billion in overpayments.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_100.wav|The taxpayers aren't the only victims of this kind of abuse.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_101.wav|The truly needy suffer, as funds intended for them are taken not by the needy, but by the greedy.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_102.wav|For everyone's sake, we must put an end to such waste and corruption.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_103.wav|Third, I will adjust our program to restore America's defenses by proposing $55 billion in defense savings over the next five years.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_105.wav|We will not gamble with our national survival.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_108.wav|Now, you could say that this is an insurance policy for the future, a remedy that will be at hand if needed, but only resorted to if absolutely necessary.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_109.wav|In the meantime, we'll continue to study ways to simplify the tax code and make it more fair for all Americans.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_110.wav|This is a goal that every American who has ever struggled with a tax form can understand.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_112.wav|The path I've outlined is fair, balanced, and realistic.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_113.wav|If enacted, it will ensure a steady decline in deficits aiming toward a balanced budget by the end of the decade.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_114.wav|It's the only path that will lead to a strong sustained recovery.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_115.wav|Let us follow that path together.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_116.wav|No domestic challenge is more crucial than providing stable, permanent jobs for all Americans who want to work.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_117.wav|The recovery program will provide jobs for most, but others will need special help and training for new skills.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_120.wav|Finally, our proposal will include new incentives for summer youth employment to help young people get a start in the job market.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_121.wav|We must offer both short-term help and long-term hope for our unemployed.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_123.wav|One out of every five jobs in our country depends on trade, so I will propose a broader strategy in the field of international trade.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_124.wav|One that increases the openness of our trading system and is fairer to America's farmers and workers in the world marketplace.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_125.wav|We must have adequate export financing to South American products overseas.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_126.wav|I will ask for new negotiating authority to remove barriers and to get more of our products into foreign markets.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_128.wav|Our trade position can also be improved by making our ports system more efficient.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_129.wav|Better, more active harbors translate into stable jobs in our coal fields, railroads, trucking industry and ports.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_131.wav|Tax policy, regulatory practices and government programs all need constant re-evaluation in terms of our competitiveness.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_132.wav|Every American has a role and a stake in international trade.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_133.wav|We Americans are still the technological leaders in most fields.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_134.wav|We must keep that edge and to do so we need to begin renewing the basics, starting with our educational system.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_135.wav|While we grew a complacent others have acted.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_136.wav|Japan with a population only about half the size of ours graduates from its universities more engineers than we do.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_139.wav|In 1983 we seek four major education goals.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_140.wav|A quality education initiative to encourage a substantial upgrading of math and science instruction through block grants to the states.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_142.wav|Passage of tuition tax credits for parents who want to send their children to private or religiously affiliated schools.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_143.wav|A constitutional amendment and eliminate once and for all all traces of unjust discrimination against women from the United States code.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_145.wav|We will also take action to remedy inequities and pensions.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_146.wav|These initiatives will be joined by others to continue our efforts to promote equity for women.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_147.wav|We will ask for extension of the Civil Rights Commission which is due to expire this year.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_148.wav|The commission is an important part of the ongoing struggle for justice in America and we strongly support its reauthorization.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_149.wav|Effective enforcement of our nation's fair housing laws is also essential to ensuring equal opportunity.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_150.wav|In the year ahead we will work to strengthen enforcement of fair housing laws for all Americans.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_151.wav|The time has also come for major reform of our criminal justice statutes and acceleration of the drive against organized crime and drug trafficking.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_152.wav|It's high time that we make our cities safe again.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_153.wav|This administration hereby declares an all-out war on big-time organized crime and the drug racketeers who are poisoning our young people.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_154.wav|We will also implement recommendations of our task force on victims of crime which will report to me this week.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_155.wav|American agriculture, the envy of the world has become the victim of its own successes.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_157.wav|We must strive through innovations like the payment in kind crop swap approach and an aggressive export policy to restore health and vitality to rural America.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_160.wav|Additionally, a major effort will be focused on encouraging the expansion of private community childcare.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_161.wav|The new advisory council on private sector initiatives will carry on and extend this vital work of encouraging private initiative in 1983.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_163.wav|And we will submit legislation to provide catastrophic illness insurance coverage for older Americans.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_164.wav|Federalism proposal that will continue our efforts to restore to states and local governments their roles as dynamic laboratories of change in a creative society.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_166.wav|So far, now I've concentrated mainly on the problems posed by the future.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_167.wav|But in almost every home and workplace in America, we're already witnessing reason for great hope.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_168.wav|The first flowering of the man-made miracles of high technology, a field pioneered and still led by our country.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_171.wav|In conquering the frontier, we cannot write off our traditional industries.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_172.wav|But we must develop the skills and industries that will make us a pioneer of tomorrow.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_173.wav|This administration is committed to keeping America the technological leader of the world now and into the 21st century.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_174.wav|America's leadership in the world came to us because of our own strength and because of the values which guide us as a society.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_176.wav|These values are the bedrock of our strength.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_177.wav|They unite us in a stewardship of peace and freedom with our allies and friends in NATO, in Asia, in Latin America, and elsewhere.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_178.wav|They are also the values which in the recent past, some among us had begun to doubt and view with a cynical eye.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_180.wav|In London last year, I announced the commitment of the United States to developing the infrastructure of democracy throughout the world.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_181.wav|We intend to pursue this democratic initiative vigorously.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_183.wav|Economic strength and military strength.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_184.wav|A strong American economy is essential to the well-being and security of our friends and allies.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_185.wav|The restoration of a strong, healthy American economy has been and remains one of the central pillars of our foreign policy.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_186.wav|The progress I've been able to report to you tonight will I know be as warmly welcomed by the rest of the world as it is by the American people.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_187.wav|We must also recognize that our own economic well-being is inextricably linked to the world economy.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_188.wav|We export over 20 percent of our industrial production and 40 percent of our farmland produces for export.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_191.wav|As some nations are tempted to turn to protectionism, our strategy cannot be to follow them but to lead the way toward free or trade.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_192.wav|To this end, in May of this year America will host an economic summit meeting in Williamsburg, Virginia.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_193.wav|As we begin our third year, we have put in place a defense program that redeems the neglect of the past decade.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_194.wav|We have developed a realistic military strategy to deter threats to peace and to protect freedom if deterrence fails.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_195.wav|Our armed forces are finally properly paid.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_196.wav|After years of neglect, are well-trained and becoming better equipped and supplied.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_199.wav|From the Middle East to southern Africa to Geneva, American diplomats are taking the initiative to make peace and lower arms levels.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_200.wav|We should be proud of our role as peacemakers.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_201.wav|In the Middle East last year, the United States played the major role in ending the tragic fighting in Lebanon and negotiated the withdrawal of the PLO from Beirut.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_206.wav|At the heart of our strategy for peace is our relationship with the Soviet Union.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_207.wav|The past year saw a change in Soviet leadership.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_209.wav|For our part, we're vigorously pursuing arms reduction negotiations with the Soviet Union.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_210.wav|Supported by our allies, we put forward draft agreements proposing significant weapon reductions to equal and verifiable lower levels.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_212.wav|At the same time, let me emphasize that allied steadfastness remains a key to achieving arms reductions.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_213.wav|With firmness and dedication, we'll continue to negotiate.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_215.wav|When that moment comes, and I'm confident that it will, we would have taken an important step toward a more peaceful future for all the world's people.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_216.wav|Once said that America has never forgotten the nobler things that brought her into being and that light her path.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_217.wav|Our country is a special place because we Americans have always been sustained through good times and bad by a noble vision.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_218.wav|A vision not only of what the world around us is today, but what we as a free people can make it be tomorrow.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_219.wav|We're realists.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_220.wav|We solve our problems instead of ignoring them, no matter how loud the chorus of despair around us.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_221.wav|But we're also idealists, for it was an ideal that brought our ancestors to these shores from every corner of the world.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_222.wav|Right now we need both realism and idealism.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_223.wav|Millions of our neighbors are without work.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_224.wav|It is up to us to see they aren't without hope.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_225.wav|This is a task for all of us, and may I say Americans have rallied to this cause, proving once again that we are the most generous people on earth.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_226.wav|We who are in government.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_227.wav|Right now with inflation as low as it is, 3.9 percent, there is room for interest rates to come down, prevents their reduction.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_228.wav|A lender, as we know, was charging interest rate that recovers the depreciated value of the dollar's loan.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_229.wav|And that depreciation is, of course, the amount of inflation.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_230.wav|Today, interest rates are based on fear.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_231.wav|Fear that government will resort to measures as it has in the past that will send inflation zooming again.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_234.wav|But we must and can give them good reason to be hopeful.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_235.wav|Back over the years, citizens like ourselves have gathered within these walls when our nation was threatened.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_237.wav|The present situation is no worse and in fact is not as bad as some of those they faced.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_238.wav|Time and again, they prove that there is nothing.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_239.wav|We Americans cannot achieve as free men and women.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_240.wav|Yes, we still have problems plenty of them.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_241.wav|But it's just plain wrong, unjust to our country and unjust to our people to let those problems stand in the way of the most important truth of all.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_242.wav|We owe it to the unfortunate to be aware of their plight and to help them in every way we can.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_243.wav|No one can quarrel with that.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_244.wav|We must and do have compassion for all the victims of this economic crisis.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_247.wav|And they've already begun the building, the research, the work, and the giving that will make our country great again.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_249.wav|A challenge for us in government is to be worthy of them, to make government a help, not a hindrance to our people and the challenging but promising days ahead.|1|72
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_001.wav|good evening.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_002.wav|Usually I talk with you from my office in the west wing of the white house, but tonight there's something special to talk about, and I've asked someone very special to join me.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_003.wav|Nancy and I are here in the west hall of the white house and around us are the rooms in which we live.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_004.wav|It's the home you've provided for us, of which we merely have temporary custody.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_005.wav|Nancy's joining me because the message this evening is not my message, but ours.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_006.wav|And we speak to you not simply as fellow citizens, but as fellow parents and grandparents and as concerned neighbors.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_008.wav|So tonight, from our family to yours, from our home to yours.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_009.wav|Thank you for joining us.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_011.wav|With us working together as a nation united.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_012.wav|Now we need your support again.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_013.wav|Drugs are menacing our society.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_014.wav|They're threatening our values and undercutting our institutions.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_015.wav|They're killing our children.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_016.wav|From the beginning of our administration, we've taken strong steps to do something about this horror.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_017.wav|Tonight, I can report to you that we've made much progress.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_018.wav|37 federal agencies are working together in a vigorous national effort.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_019.wav|And by next year, our spending for drug law enforcement will have more than tripled from its 1981 levels.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_020.wav|We have increased seizures of illegal drugs.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_021.wav|Shortages of marijuana are now being reported.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_023.wav|And in the most important area, individual use, we see progress.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_024.wav|In four years, the number of high school seniors using marijuana on a daily basis has dropped from one in 14 to one in 20.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_025.wav|The U.S. military has cut the use of illegal drugs among its personnel by 67 percent since 1980.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_026.wav|These are a measure of our commitment and emerging signs that we can defeat this enemy.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_027.wav|But we still have much to do.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_028.wav|Despite our best efforts, illegal cocaine is coming into our country at alarming levels, and four to five million people regularly use it.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_029.wav|Five hundred thousand Americans are hooked on heroin.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_030.wav|One in 12 persons spoke marijuana regularly.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_031.wav|Regular drug use is even higher among the age group 18 to 25, most likely just entering the workforce.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_032.wav|Today, there's a new epidemic.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_033.wav|Smokable cocaine, otherwise known as crack.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_034.wav|It is an explosively destructive and often lethal substance, which is crushing its users.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_035.wav|It is an uncontrolled fire.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_036.wav|And drug abuse is not a so-called victimless crime.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_038.wav|Drug abuse costs you and your federal Americans at least $60 billion a year.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_039.wav|From the early days of our administration, Nancy has been intensely involved in the effort to fight drug abuse.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_042.wav|Her personal observations and efforts have given her such dramatic insights that I wanted her to share them with you this evening.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_044.wav|I think you can see why Nancy has been such a positive influence on all that we're trying to do.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_045.wav|The job ahead of us is very clear.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_046.wav|Nancy's personal crusade, like that of so many other wonderful individuals, should become our national crusade.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_047.wav|It must include a combination of government and private efforts which complement one another.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_048.wav|Last month, I announced six initiatives which we believe will do just that.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_049.wav|First, we seek a drug-free workplace at all levels of government and in the private sector.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_050.wav|Second, we'll work toward drug-free schools.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_051.wav|Third, we want to ensure that the public is protected and the treatment is available to substance abusers and the chemically dependent.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_052.wav|Our fourth goal is to expand international cooperation while treating drug trafficking as a threat to our national security.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_053.wav|In October, I will be meeting with key US ambassadors to discuss what can be done to support our friends abroad.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_054.wav|Fifth, we must move to strengthen law enforcement activities such as those initiated by Vice President Bush and Attorney General Mice.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_055.wav|And finally, we seek to expand public awareness and prevention.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_056.wav|In order to further implement these six goals, I will announce tomorrow a series of new proposals for a drug-free America.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_058.wav|Together with our ongoing efforts, these proposals will bring the federal commitment to fighting drugs to $3 billion.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_059.wav|As much financing as we commit, however, we would be fooling ourselves if we thought that massive new amounts of money alone will provide the solution.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_060.wav|Let us not forget that in America, people solve problems and no national crusade has ever succeeded without human investment.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_061.wav|Winning the crusade against drugs will not be achieved by just throwing money at the problem.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_062.wav|Your government will continue to act aggressively, but nothing would be more effective than for Americans simply to quit using illegal drugs.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_063.wav|We seek to create a massive change in national attitudes which ultimately will separate the drugs from the customer, to take the user away from the supply.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_064.wav|I believe quite simply that we can help them quit, and that's where you come in.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_065.wav|My generation will remember how America swung into action when we were attacked in World War II.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_067.wav|Well, now we're in another war for our freedom, and it's time for all of us to pull together again.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_068.wav|So, for example, if your friend or neighbor or a family member has a drug or alcohol problem, don't turn the other way.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_069.wav|Go to his help or to hers.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_070.wav|Get others involved with you, clubs, service groups and community organizations, and provide support and strength.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_071.wav|And of course, many of you have been cured through treatment and self-help.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_072.wav|Well, you're the combat veterans, and you have a critical role to play.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_073.wav|You can help others by telling your story and providing a willing hand to those in need.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_074.wav|Being friends to others is the best way of being friends to ourselves.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_075.wav|It's time, as Nancy said, for America to just say no to drugs.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_076.wav|Those of you in union halls and workplaces everywhere, please make this challenge a part of your job every day.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_077.wav|Help us preserve the health and dignity of all workers.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_078.wav|To business as large and small, we need the creativity of your enterprise, applied directly to this national problem.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_079.wav|Help us.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_080.wav|And those of you who are educators, your wisdom and leadership are indispensable to this cause.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_081.wav|From the pulpits of this spirit-filled land, we would welcome your reassuring message of redemption and forgiveness and of helping one another.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_082.wav|On the athletic fields, you men and women are among the most beloved citizens of our country.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_083.wav|A child's eyes fill with your heroic achievements.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_084.wav|Few of us can give youngsters something as special and strong to look up to as you.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_085.wav|Please don't let them down.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_087.wav|To our friends in foreign countries, we know many of you were involved in this battle with us.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_088.wav|We need your success as well as ours.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_090.wav|Then they will have no dark alleyways to hide in.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_091.wav|In this crusade, let us not forget who we are.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_092.wav|Drug abuse is a repudiation of everything America is.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_093.wav|The destructiveness and human wreckage mock our heritage.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_094.wav|Think for a moment how special it is to be an American.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_095.wav|Can we doubt that only a divine providence place this land?|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_096.wav|This island of freedom here is a refuge for all those people in the world who yearn to breathe free.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_097.wav|The revolution out of which our liberty was conceived signaled an historical call to an entire world seeking hope.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_098.wav|Each new arrival of immigrants rode the crest of that hope.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_099.wav|They came millions seeking a safe harbor from the oppression of cruel regimes.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_100.wav|They came to escape starvation and disease.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_101.wav|They came those surviving the Holocaust and the Soviet Goulegs.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_102.wav|They came the boat people, chancing death for even a glimmer of hope that they could have a new life.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_103.wav|They all came to taste the air, redel it and rich with the freedom that is ours.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_104.wav|What an insult it will be to what we are and once we came, if we do not rise up together in defiance against this cancer of drugs.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_105.wav|And there's one more thing.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_106.wav|The freedom that so many seek in our land has not been preserved without a price.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_107.wav|Nancy and I shared that remembrance two years ago at the Normandy American Cemetery in France.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_109.wav|Too many of these and other such graves are the final resting places of teenagers who became men in the roar of battle.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_110.wav|Look what they gave to us who lived.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_111.wav|Never would they see another sunlit day glistening off a lake or river back home or a miles of corn pushing up against the open sky of our plains.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_113.wav|They did this for you, for me, for a new generation to carry our democratic experiment proudly forward.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_115.wav|As we mobilize for this national crusade, I'm mindful that drugs are a constant temptation for millions.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_116.wav|Please remember this when your courage is tested.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_117.wav|You are Americans.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_118.wav|You're the product of the freest society mankind has ever known.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_119.wav|No one ever has the right to destroy your dreams and shatter your life.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_120.wav|Write down the end of this hall as the Lincoln bedroom.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_121.wav|But in the Civil War that room was the one president Lincoln used as his office.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_122.wav|Memory fills that room and more than anything that memory drives us to see vividly what President Lincoln sought to save.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_124.wav|We Americans have never been morally neutral against any form of tyranny.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_125.wav|Tonight we're asking no more than that we honor what we have been and what we are by standing together.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_126.wav|God bless you and good night.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_001.wav|I fell Americans, this is the 34th time I'll speak to you from the Oval Office and the last.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_002.wav|We've been together eight years now and soon it'll be time for me to go.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_003.wav|But before I do, I wanted to share some thoughts, some of which I've been saving for a long time.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_004.wav|It's been the honor of my life to be your president.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_005.wav|So many of you have written the past few weeks to say thanks, but I could say as much to you, Nancy and I are grateful for the opportunity you gave us to serve.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_006.wav|One of the things about the presidency is that you're always somewhat apart.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_008.wav|Well, maybe I can do a little of that tonight.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_009.wav|People ask how I feel about leaving and the fact is parting is such sweet sorrow.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_010.wav|The sweet part is California and the ranch and freedom.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_011.wav|The sorrow, the good buys of course and leaving this beautiful place.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_012.wav|You know down the hall and up the stairs from this office is the part of the White House where the president and his family live.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_013.wav|There are a few favorite windows I have up there that I like to stand and look out of early in the morning.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_014.wav|The view is over the grounds here to the Washington Monument and then the Mall and the Jefferson Memorial.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_015.wav|But on mornings when the humidity is low, you can see past the Jefferson to the river, the Potomac and the Virginia Shore.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_016.wav|Someone said that's the view Lincoln had when he saw the smoke rising from the Battle of Bull Run.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_017.wav|Well, I see more prosaic things.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_018.wav|The grass on the banks, the morning traffic as people make their way to work, now and then a sailboat on the river.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_019.wav|I've been thinking a bit at that window.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_020.wav|I've been reflecting on what the past eight years have meant and mean.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_021.wav|And the image that comes to mind like a refrain is an article one.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_022.wav|A small story about a big ship and a refugee and a sailor.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_023.wav|It was back in the early eighties at the height of the boat people.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_024.wav|And the sailor was hard at work on the carrier midway, which was patrolling the South China Sea.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_025.wav|The sailor like most American servicemen was young, smart and fiercely observant.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_026.wav|The crew spied on the horizon a leaky little boat and crammed inside were refugees from Indochina hoping to get to America.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_027.wav|The midway sent a small launch to bring them to the ship and safety.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_028.wav|As the refugees made their way through the choppy seas, one spied the sailor on deck and stood up and called out to him.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_029.wav|He yelled, hello, American sailor, hello, freedom man.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_030.wav|A small moment with a big meeting, a moment the sailor who wrote it in the letter couldn't get out of his mind.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_031.wav|And when I saw it, neither could I.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_032.wav|Because that's what it has to be in America in the 1980s.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_033.wav|We stood again for freedom.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_034.wav|I know we always have, but in the past few years, the world again and in a way we ourselves rediscovered it.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_035.wav|It's been quite a journey this decade and we held together through some stormy seas.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_036.wav|And at the end, together we're reaching our destination.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_038.wav|The way I see it, there were two great triumphs, two things that I'm proud of stuff.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_039.wav|One is the economic recovery in which the people of America created and filled 19 million new jobs.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_040.wav|The other is the recovery of our morale.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_041.wav|America is respected again in the world and looked to for leadership.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_042.wav|Something that happened to me a few years ago reflects some of this.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_043.wav|It was back in 1981 and I was attending my first big economic summit, which was held that year in Canada.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_044.wav|The meeting place rotates among the member countries.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_045.wav|The opening meeting was a formal dinner for the heads of government of the seven industrialized nations.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_046.wav|Well, I sat there like the new kid in school and listened and it was all Francois Visson, Helmut that.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_047.wav|They dropped titles and spoke to one another on a first name basis.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_048.wav|Well, at one point I sort of leaned in and said, my name's Ron.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_050.wav|Two years later, another economic summit with pretty much the same cast.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_051.wav|At the big opening meeting, we all got together and all of a sudden and just for a moment.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_052.wav|I saw that everyone was just sitting there looking at me and then one of them broke the silence.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_053.wav|Tell us about the American miracle, he said.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_054.wav|Well, back in 1980, when I was running for president, it was all so different.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_055.wav|Some pundits said our programs would result in catastrophe.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_056.wav|Our views on foreign affairs would cause war.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_057.wav|Our plans for the economy would cause inflation to soar and bring about economic collapse.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_059.wav|Well, he and the other opinion leaders were wrong.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_060.wav|The fact is what they called radical was really right.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_061.wav|What they called dangerous was just desperately needed.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_062.wav|And in all of that time, I want a nickname, the great communicator.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_063.wav|But I never thought it was my style or the words I used that made a difference.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_064.wav|It was the content.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_065.wav|I wasn't a great communicator, but I communicated great things.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_066.wav|And they didn't spring full bloom from my brow.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_067.wav|They came from the heart of a great nation.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_068.wav|From our experience, our wisdom, and our belief in the principles that have guided us for two centuries.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_069.wav|They called it the Reagan Revolution.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_070.wav|Well, I'll accept that.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_071.wav|But for me, it always seemed more like the great rediscovery, a rediscovery of our values and our common sense.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_072.wav|Common sense told us that when you put a big tax on something, the people will produce less of it.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_073.wav|So we cut the people's tax rates and the people produced more than ever before.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_074.wav|The economy, bloomed like a plant that had been cut back and could now grow quicker and stronger.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_075.wav|Our economic program brought about the longest peacetime expansion in our history.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_076.wav|Real family income up, the poverty rate down, entrepreneurship booming, and an explosion in research and new technology.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_077.wav|We're exporting more now than ever because American industry became more competitive.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_078.wav|And at the same time, we summoned the national will to knock down protectionist walls of broad instead of erecting them at home.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_079.wav|Common sense also told us that to preserve the peace, we'd have to become strong again after years of weakness and confusion.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_080.wav|So we rebuild our defenses.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_081.wav|In this new year, we toasted the new peacefulness around the globe.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_082.wav|Not only of the superpowers actually begun to reduce their stockpiles of nuclear weapons and hope for even more progress is bright.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_083.wav|But the regional conflicts that rack the globe are also beginning to cease.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_084.wav|The Persian Gulf is no longer a war zone.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_085.wav|The Soviets are leaving Afghanistan.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_086.wav|The Vietnamese are preparing to pull out of Cambodia.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_087.wav|And an American mediated accord will soon send 50,000 Cuban troops home from Angola.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_088.wav|The lesson of all this was, of course, that because we're a great nation, our challenges seem complex.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_089.wav|It will always be this way.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_090.wav|But as long as we remember our first principles and believe in ourselves, the future will always be ours.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_091.wav|And something else we learned.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_092.wav|Once you begin a great movement, there's no telling where to end.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_093.wav|We meant to change a nation.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_094.wav|And instead, we changed the world.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_095.wav|Countries across the globe are turning to free markets and free speech and turning away from the ideologies of the past.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_096.wav|For them, the great rediscovery of the 1980s has been that lo and behold, the moral way of government is the practical way of government.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_097.wav|Democracy, the profoundly good, is also the profoundly productive.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_099.wav|For me, there was a fork in the river, and it was right in the middle of my life.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_100.wav|I never meant to go into politics.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_101.wav|Wasn't my intention when I was young.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_102.wav|But I was raised to believe you had to pay your way for the blessings be stowed on you.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_103.wav|I was happy with my career in the entertainment world, but I ultimately went into politics because I wanted to protect something precious.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_104.wav|Hours was the first revolution in the history of mankind that truly reversed the course of government and with three little words.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_105.wav|We, the people.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_106.wav|We the people tell the government what to do.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_107.wav|It doesn't tell us.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_108.wav|We the people are the driver.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_109.wav|The government is the car and we decide where it should go and by what route and how fast.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_110.wav|Almost all the world's constitutions are documents in which governments tell the people what their privileges are.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_111.wav|Our constitution is a document in which we the people tell the government what it is allowed to do.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_112.wav|We the people are free.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_113.wav|This belief has been the underlying basis for everything I've tried to do these past eight years.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_114.wav|But back in the 1960s when I began, it seemed to me that we'd begun reversing the order of things.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_116.wav|I went into politics in part to put up my hand and say stop.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_117.wav|I was a citizen politician and to seem the right thing for a citizen to do.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_118.wav|I think we have stopped a lot of what needed stopping.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_119.wav|And I hope we have once again reminded people that man is not free unless government is limited.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_120.wav|There's a clear cause and effect here that is as neat and predictable as a law of physics, as government expands liberty contracts.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_121.wav|Nothing is less free than pure communism.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_122.wav|And yet we have the past few years forged to satisfy new closeless with the Soviet Union.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_123.wav|I've been asked if this isn't a gamble and my answer is no because we're basing our actions not on words but deeds.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_124.wav|The data of the 1970s was based not on actions but promises.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_126.wav|Well this time so far it's different.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_127.wav|President Gorbachev has brought about some internal democratic reforms and begun the withdrawal from Afghanistan.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_128.wav|He is also free prisoners whose names I've given him every time we've met.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_129.wav|But life has a way of reminding you of big things through small incidents.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_130.wav|Once during the heavy days of the Moscow Summit, Nancy and I decided to break off from the entourage one afternoon to visit the shops on Arbat Street.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_131.wav|That's a little street just off Moscow's main shopping area.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_132.wav|Even though our visit was a surprise every Russian there immediately recognized us and called out our names and reached for our hands.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_133.wav|We were just about swept away by the warmth.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_134.wav|You could almost feel the possibilities in all that joy.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_135.wav|But within seconds a KGB detail pushed their way toward us and began pushing and shoving the people in the crowd.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_136.wav|It was an interesting moment.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_138.wav|We must keep up our guard, but we must also continue to work together to lessen and eliminate tension and mistrust.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_139.wav|My view is that President Gorbachev is different from previous Soviet leaders.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_140.wav|I think he knows some of the things wrong with his society and is trying to fix them.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_141.wav|We wish him well and we'll continue to work to make sure that the Soviet Union that eventually emerges from this process is a less threatening one.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_142.wav|What it all boils down to is this.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_144.wav|If and when they don't, that first pull your punches if they persist, pull the plug.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_145.wav|It's still trust but verify.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_146.wav|It's still play but cut the cards.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_147.wav|It's still watch closely and don't be afraid to see what you see.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_148.wav|I've been asked if I have any regrets.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_150.wav|The deficit is one.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_151.wav|I've been talking a great deal about that lately, but tonight isn't for arguments and I'm going to hold my tongue.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_153.wav|They never saw my troops.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_154.wav|They never saw Reagan's regiments, the American people.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_155.wav|You won every battle with every call you made and letter you wrote demanding action.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_156.wav|Well, action is still needed.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_157.wav|If we're to finish the job of Reagan's regiments, we'll have to become the Bush brigades.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_158.wav|Soon he'll be the chief and he'll need you every bit as much as I did.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_159.wav|Finally, there is a great tradition of warnings in presidential farewells and I've got one that's been on my mind for some time.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_160.wav|But oddly enough, it starts with one of the things I'm proudest of in the past eight years.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_161.wav|The resurgence of national pride that I called the new patriotism.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_162.wav|This national feeling is good, but it won't come for much and it won't last unless it's grounded in thoughtfulness and knowledge.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_163.wav|An informed patriotism is what we want.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_164.wav|And are we doing a good enough job teaching our children what America is and what she represents in the long history of the world.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_165.wav|Those of us who were over 35 or so years of age grew up in a different America.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_166.wav|We were taught very directly what it means to be an American.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_167.wav|And we absorbed almost in the air, a love of country and an appreciation of its institutions.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_169.wav|And if all else failed, you could get a sense of patriotism from the popular culture.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_170.wav|The movies celebrated democratic values and implicitly reinforced the idea that America was special.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_171.wav|TV was like that too through the mid-60s.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_172.wav|But now we're about to enter the 90s.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_173.wav|And some things have changed.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_174.wav|Younger parents aren't sure that an unambivalent appreciation of America is the right thing to teach modern children.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_175.wav|And as for those who create the popular culture, well-grounded patriotism is no longer the style.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_176.wav|Our spirit is back, but we haven't re-institutionalized it.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_177.wav|We've got to do a better job of getting across that America is freedom.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_178.wav|Freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of enterprise, and freedom is special and rare.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_179.wav|It's fragile.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_180.wav|It needs production.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_181.wav|So we've got to teach history based not on what's in fashion, but what's important.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_182.wav|Why the pilgrims came here?|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_183.wav|Who Jimmy Dildo was?|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_184.wav|And what those 30 seconds over Tokyo meant?|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_186.wav|Her name was Lisa Zanada Hen.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_187.wav|And she said, we will always remember, we will never forget what the boys of Normandy did.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_188.wav|Well, let's help her keep her word.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_189.wav|If we forget what we did, we won't know who we are.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_190.wav|I'm warning of an eradication of that, of the American memory that could result ultimately in an erosion of the American spirit.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_191.wav|Let's start with some basics.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_192.wav|More attention to American history and a greater emphasis on civic ritual.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_193.wav|And let me offer lesson number one about America.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_194.wav|All great change in America begins at the dinner table.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_195.wav|So tomorrow night in the kitchen, I hope the talking begins.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_196.wav|And children, if your parents haven't been teaching you what it means to be an American, let them know and nail them on it.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_197.wav|That would be a very American thing to do.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_198.wav|And that's about all I have to say tonight, except for one thing.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_199.wav|The fast few days when I've been at that window upstairs, I've thought a bit of the shining city upon a hill.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_200.wav|The phrase comes from John Winthrop, who wrote it to describe the America he imagined.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_201.wav|What he imagined was important because he was an early pilgrim, an early freedom man.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_202.wav|He journeyed here on what today we'd call a little wooden boat.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_203.wav|And like the other pilgrims, he was looking for a home that would be free.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_204.wav|I've spoken of the shining city all my political life, but I don't know if I ever quite communicated what I saw when I said it.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_206.wav|A city with pre-ports that hummed with commerce and creativity.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_207.wav|And if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors, and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_208.wav|That's how I saw it and see it still.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_209.wav|And how stands the city on this winter night?|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_210.wav|More prosperous, more secure and happier than it was eight years ago.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_214.wav|My friends, we did it.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_215.wav|We weren't just marking time.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_216.wav|We made the city stronger.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_217.wav|We made the city freer, and we left her in good hands.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_218.wav|All in all, not bad, not bad at all.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_219.wav|And so goodbye.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_220.wav|God bless you and God bless the United States of America.|1|78
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_002.wav|i want you to know that your statements of support here were greatly appreciated,|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_003.wav|you can't imagine how much it means in dealing with the Soviets to have the congress, the allies and the american people,|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_004.wav|general secretary Gorbachev,|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_005.wav|in the past few days,|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_006.wav|the past two days,|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_009.wav|accepted his invitation to go to maska,|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_010.wav|the following year,|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_011.wav|our subject matter was shaped by the facts of this century,|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_012.wav|these past 40 years have not been an easy time for the west or for the world,|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_013.wav|you know the facts, there is no need to recite the historical record,|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_014.wav|suffice it to say that the united states cannot afford illusions about the nature of the USSR,|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_015.wav|we cannot assume that their ideology and purpose will change, this implies enduring competition,|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_020.wav|I made clear before the first meeting that no question would be swept aside, no issue buried just because either side found it uncomfortable or inconvenient.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_021.wav|I brought these questions to the summit and put them before Mr. Gorbachev.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_022.wav|We discussed nuclear arms and how to reduce them.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_023.wav|I explained our proposals for equitable, verifiable and deep reductions.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_024.wav|I outlined my conviction that our proposals would make not just for a world that feels safer but one that is really safer.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_025.wav|And I'm pleased to report tonight that General Secretary Gorbachev and I did make a measure of progress here.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_026.wav|We moved arms control forward from where we were last January when the Soviets returned to the table.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_027.wav|We are both instructing our negotiators to hasten their vital work and the world is waiting for the results.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_028.wav|Specifically, we agreed in Geneva that each side should move to cut offensive nuclear arms by 50 percent in appropriate categories.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_029.wav|In our joint statement, we called for early progress on this, turning the talks toward our chief goal, offensive reductions.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_030.wav|We called for an interim accord on intermediate-range nuclear forces, leading, I hope, to the complete elimination of this class of missiles.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_031.wav|And all of this, with tough verification, an arms control area at which we've cooperated effectively over the years.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_034.wav|Our research effort that envisions the possibility of defensive systems which could ultimately protect all nations against the danger of nuclear war.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_035.wav|This discussion produced a very direct exchange of views.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_036.wav|Mr. Gorbachev insisted that we might use a strategic defense system to put offensive weapons into space and establish nuclear superiority.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_038.wav|It will bring much closer the safer, more stable world that we seek.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_039.wav|Nations could defend themselves against missile attack, and mankind at long last escaped the prison of mutual terror.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_040.wav|And this is my dream.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_042.wav|We don't seek nuclear superiority.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_043.wav|We do not seek a first strike advantage over the Soviet Union.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_045.wav|I went further in expressing our peaceful intentions.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_046.wav|I described our proposal in the Geneva negotiations for a reciprocal program of open laboratories in strategic defense research.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_047.wav|We're offering to permit Soviet experts to see firsthand that SDI does not involve offensive weapons.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_049.wav|Finally, I reassured Mr. Gorbachev on another point.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_051.wav|We discussed threats to the peace in several regions of the world.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_053.wav|I tried to be very clear about where our sympathies lie.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_054.wav|I believe I succeeded.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_055.wav|We discussed human rights.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_056.wav|We Americans believe that history retie teaches no clearer lesson than this.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_057.wav|Those countries which respect the rights of their own people tended evitably to respect.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_058.wav|Finally, we discussed the barriers to communication between our societies.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_059.wav|I elaborated on my proposals for real people to people contacts on a wide scale.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_060.wav|Americans should know the people of the Soviet Union, their hopes and fears and the facts of their lives.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_061.wav|And citizens of the Soviet Union need to know of America's deep desire for peace and our unwavering attachment to freedom.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_062.wav|As you can see, our talks were wide-ranging.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_063.wav|And let me, at this point, tell you what we agreed upon and what we didn't.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_064.wav|We remain far apart in a number of issues, as had to be expected.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_065.wav|However, we reached agreement on a number of matters.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_066.wav|And as I mentioned, we agreed to continue meeting.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_067.wav|And this is important and very good.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_068.wav|We've concluded a new agreement designed to bring the best of America's artists and academics to the Soviet Union.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_069.wav|The exhibits that will be included in this exchange are one of the most effective ways for the average Soviet citizen to learn about our way of life.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_073.wav|We've agreed to establish a new Soviet consulate in New York and a new American consulate in Kiev.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_074.wav|Together with the government of Japan, concluded a Pacific Air Safety Agreement with the Soviet Union.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_075.wav|This is designed to set up cooperative measures to improve civil air safety in that region of the Pacific.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_076.wav|We have also advocated international cooperation to explore the feasibility of developing fusion energy.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_077.wav|All of these steps are part of a long-term effort to build a more stable relationship with the Soviet Union.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_078.wav|No one ever said it could be easy, but we've come a long way.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_081.wav|We know the limits as well as the promise of summit meetings.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_082.wav|This is after all the 11th summit of the post-war era, and still the differences endure.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_083.wav|But we believe continued leaders, continued meetings between the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union, can help bridge those differences.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_084.wav|The fact is every new day begins with possibilities.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_085.wav|It's up to us to fill it with the things that move us toward progress and peace.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_086.wav|Hope, therefore, is a realistic attitude and despair and uninteresting little vice.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_087.wav|And so was our journey worthwhile?|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_088.wav|Well, 30 years ago, when he|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_090.wav|Well, today, three decades later, that is still true.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_091.wav|But yes, the summit itself was a good start, and now our byword must be, steady as we go.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_092.wav|I am as you are impatient for results, but goodwill and good hopes do not always yield lasting results.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_093.wav|And quick fixes don't fix big problems.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_094.wav|Just as we must avoid illusions on our side, so we must dispel them on the Soviet side.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_095.wav|I've made it clear to Mr. Gorbachev that we must reduce the mistrust and suspicions between us if we are to do such things as reduce arms.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_096.wav|And this will take deeds, not words alone.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_097.wav|And I believe he is in agreement.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_098.wav|Where do we go from here?|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_099.wav|Well, our desire for improved relations is strong.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_100.wav|We're ready and eager for step-by-step progress.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_101.wav|We know that peace is not just the absence of war.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_102.wav|We don't want a phony peace or a frail peace.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_103.wav|We didn't go and pursue to some kind of illusory detente.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_104.wav|We can't be satisfied with cosmetic improvements that won't stand the test of time.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_105.wav|We want real peace.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_106.wav|As I flew back this evening, I had many thoughts.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_107.wav|In just a few days, families across America will gather to celebrate Thanksgiving.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_109.wav|When pilgrims and Indians huddle together the edge of an unknown continent.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_110.wav|And now here we are gathered together on the edge of an unknown future.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_111.wav|But like our forefathers, we're really not so much afraid.|1|74
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_001.wav|well, in the hospital, I had, as you can readily understand, a lot of time for reflection.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_003.wav|Never had peace and goodwill seemed closer at hand.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_004.wav|I'd like to read you a few paragraphs from that letter.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_007.wav|I went on in my letter to say, the people of the world still share that hope.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_008.wav|Indeed, the peoples of the world, despite differences in rational and ethnic origin, have very much in common.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_009.wav|They want the dignity of having some control over their individual lives, their destiny.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_010.wav|They want to work at the craft or trade of their own choosing and to be fairly rewarded.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_011.wav|They want to raise their families in peace without harming anyone or suffering harm themselves.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_012.wav|Government exists for their convenience, not the other way around.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_013.wav|If they're incapable, as some would have us believe, of self-government, then where among them do we find any who are capable of governing others?|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_016.wav|Is life better for the people of Cuba because the Cuban military dictate who shall govern the people of Angola?|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_019.wav|When World War 2 ended, the United States had the only undamaged industrial power in the world.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_021.wav|If we had sought world domination, then who could have opposed us?|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_022.wav|But the United States followed a different course, one unique in all the history of mankind.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_023.wav|We used our power and wealth to rebuild the war ravaged economies of the world, including those of the nations who had been our enemies.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_025.wav|I continued my letter by saying, or concluded my letter,|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_026.wav|I should say, by saying,|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_029.wav|Specifically, I want to present our program for preserving peace in Europe and our wider program for arms control.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_030.wav|Twice in my lifetime, I have seen the peoples of Europe plunged into the tragedy of war.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_034.wav|But today, a new generation is emerging on both sides of the Atlantic.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_035.wav|Its members were not present at the creation of the North Atlantic Alliance.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_036.wav|Many of them don't fully understand its roots in defending freedom and rebuilding a war to encontinue it.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_037.wav|Some young people question why we need weapons, particularly nuclear weapons, to deter war and to assure peaceful development.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_038.wav|They fear that the accumulation of weapons itself may lead to conflagration.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_039.wav|Some even propose unilateral disarmament.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_040.wav|I understand their concerns, their questions deserve to be answered.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_041.wav|But we have an obligation to answer their questions on the basis of judgment and reason and experience.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_042.wav|Our policies have resulted in the longest European peace in this century.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_043.wav|Wouldn't a rash departure from these policies as some now suggest endanger that peace?|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_044.wav|From its founding, the Atlantic Alliance has preserved the peace through unity, deterrence, and dialogue.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_045.wav|First, we and our allies have stood united by the firm commitment that an attack upon any one of us would be considered an attack upon us all.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_048.wav|These three elements of our policy have preserved the peace in Europe for more than a third of a century.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_049.wav|They can preserve it for generations to come, so long as we pursue them with sufficient will and vigor.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_050.wav|Today, I wish to reaffirm America's commitment to the Atlantic Alliance and I'll resolve to sustain the peace.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_051.wav|And from my conversations with Allied leaders, I know that they also remain true to this tried and proven course.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_052.wav|NATO's policy of peace is based on restraint and balance.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_053.wav|No NATO weapons, conventional or nuclear will ever be used in Europe except in response to attack.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_054.wav|NATO's defense plans have been responsible and restrained.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_055.wav|The allies remain strong, united and resolute.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_056.wav|But the momentum of the continuing Soviet military build-up threatens both the conventional and the nuclear balance.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_057.wav|Consider the facts.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_058.wav|Over the past decade, the United States reduced the size of its armed forces and decreased its military spending.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_059.wav|The Soviets steadily increased the number of men under arms. They now number more than double those of the United States.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_060.wav|Over the same period, the Soviets expanded their real military spending by about one-third.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_061.wav|The Soviet Union increased its inventory of tanks to some 50,000 compared to our 11,000.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_064.wav|Our response to this relentless build-up of Soviet military power has been restrained but firm.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_065.wav|We have made decisions to strengthen all three legs of the strategic triad, sea, land and air-based.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_069.wav|There are other Soviet weapon systems which also represent a major threat.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_070.wav|Now the only answer to these systems is a comparable threat to Soviet threats.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_071.wav|To Soviet targets, in other words, a deterrent, preventing the use of these Soviet weapons by the counter-threat of a like-response against their own territory.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_074.wav|These missiles are to be deployed in several countries of Western Europe.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_075.wav|This relatively limited force in no way serves as a substitute for the much larger strategic umbrella spread over our NATO Allies.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_077.wav|Deployment of these systems will demonstrate to the Soviet Union that this link cannot be broken.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_078.wav|Deturing war depends on the perceived ability of our forces to perform effectively.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_079.wav|The more effective our forces are, the less likely it is that we'll have to use them.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_081.wav|Now, let me turn now to our hopes for arms control negotiations.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_082.wav|There's a tendency to make this entire subject overly complex.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_083.wav|I want to be clear and concise.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_084.wav|I told you of the letter I wrote to President Brezhnev last April, well, I've just sent another message to the Soviet leadership.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_085.wav|It's a simple straightforward yet historic message.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_086.wav|The United States proposes the mutual reduction of conventional, intermediate range nuclear and strategic forces.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_087.wav|Specifically, I have proposed a four-point agenda to achieve this objective in my letter to President Brezhnev.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_088.wav|The first and most important point concerns the Geneva negotiations.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_090.wav|The United States has been preparing for these negotiations through close consultation with our NATO partners.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_091.wav|We're now ready to set forth our proposal.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_094.wav|This would be an historic step.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_095.wav|With Soviet agreement, we could together substantially reduce the dread threat of nuclear war which hangs over the people of Europe.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_096.wav|This, like the first footstep on the moon, would be a giant step for mankind.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_097.wav|Now, we intend to negotiate in good faith and go to Geneva willing to listen and to and consider the proposals of our Soviet counterpots.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_098.wav|But let me call to your attention the background of which, against which our proposal is made.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_100.wav|They now have 1,100 warheads on the SS-20s, SS-4s, and 5s.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_101.wav|And the United States has no comparable missiles.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_102.wav|Indeed, the United States dismantled the last such missile in Europe over 15 years ago.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_104.wav|The Soviets assert that a balance of intermediate-range nuclear forces already exists.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_105.wav|That assertion is wrong.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_106.wav|By any objective measure, as this chart indicates, the Soviet Union has developed an increasingly overwhelming advantage.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_107.wav|They now enjoy a superiority on the order of 6 to 1.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_108.wav|The red is the Soviet buildup.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_109.wav|The blue is our own.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_110.wav|That is 1975, and that is 1981.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_111.wav|Now, Soviet spokesmen have suggested that moving their SS-20s behind the Euro-Mounts will remove the threat to Europe.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_113.wav|These little images mark the present location, which would give them a range clear out into the Atlantic.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_114.wav|The second proposal that I've made to President Brezhnev concerns strategic weapons.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_115.wav|The United States proposes to open negotiations on strategic arms as soon as possible next year.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_116.wav|I have instructed Secretary Hague to discuss the timing of such meetings with Soviet representatives.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_117.wav|Substance, however, is far more important than timing.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_118.wav|As our proposal for the Geneva talks this month illustrates, we can make proposals for genuinely serious reductions, not only if we take the time to prepare carefully.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_119.wav|The United States has been preparing carefully for resumption of strategic arms negotiations because we don't want a repetition of past disappointments.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_120.wav|We don't want an arms control process that sends hope soaring only to end in dashed expectations.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_122.wav|Our approach to verification will be to emphasize openness and creativity rather than the secrecy and suspicion which have undermined confidence in arms control in the past.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_124.wav|We can and should attempt major qualitative and quantitative progress.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_125.wav|Only such progress can fulfill the hopes of our own people and the rest of the world.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_126.wav|And let us see how far we can go in achieving truly substantial reductions in our strategic arsenal.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_127.wav|To symbolize this fundamental change in direction, we will call these negotiations start.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_128.wav|Strategic arms reduction talks.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_129.wav|The third proposal I have made to the Soviet Union is that we act to achieve equality at lower levels of conventional forces in Europe.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_133.wav|I am renewing our proposal for a conference to develop effective measures that would reduce these dangers.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_134.wav|At the current Madrid meeting of the conference on security and cooperation in Europe, we are laying the foundation for a Western proposed conference on disarmament in Europe.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_135.wav|This conference would discuss new measures to enhance stability and security in Europe.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_136.wav|Agreement in this conference is within reach.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_137.wav|I urge the Soviet Union to join us and many other nations who are ready to launch this important enterprise.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_139.wav|My administration, our country, and I are committed to achieving arms reductions agreements based on these principles.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_140.wav|Today, I have outlined the kinds of bold, equitable proposals which the world expects of us, but we cannot reduce arms unilaterally.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_143.wav|The American concept of peace goes well beyond the absence of war.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_144.wav|We foresee a flowering of economic growth and individual liberty in a world at peace.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_147.wav|And terms like peace and security, we have to say have little meaning for the oppressed in the destitute.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_148.wav|They also mean little to the individual whose state has stripped him of human freedom and dignity.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_149.wav|Wherever there's oppression, we must strive for the peace and security of individuals as well as states.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_150.wav|We must recognize that progress in the pursuit of liberty is a necessary complement to military security.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_151.wav|Nowhere has this fundamental truth been more boldly and clearly stated than in the Helsinki Accords of 1975.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_152.wav|These accords have not yet been translated into living reality.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_153.wav|Today, I have announced an agenda that can help to achieve peace, security, and freedom across the globe.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_155.wav|There is no reason why people in any part of the world should have to live in permanent fear of war or its specter.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_156.wav|I believe the time has come for all nations to act in a responsible spirit that doesn't threaten other states.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_157.wav|I believe the time is right to move forward on arms control and the resolution of critical regional disputes at the conference table.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_158.wav|Nothing will have a higher priority for me and for the American people over the coming months and years.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_159.wav|Addressing the United Nations 20 years ago, another American president described the goal that we still pursue today.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_161.wav|He didn't live to see that goal achieved.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_162.wav|I invite all nations to join with America today in the quest for such a world.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_004.wav|In the eyes of many in the world, this every four years ceremony we accept as normal is nothing less than a miracle.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_005.wav|Mr. President,|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_006.wav|I want our fellow citizens to know how much you did to carry on this tradition.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_008.wav|And I thank you and your people for all your help in maintaining the continuity, which is the bulwark of our republic.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_009.wav|These United States are confronted with an economic affliction of great proportions.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_010.wav|We suffer from the longest and one of the worst sustained inflation in our national history.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_011.wav|It distorts our economic decisions, penalizes thrift, and crushes the struggling young and the fixed income elderly alike.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_014.wav|But great as our tax burden is, it has not kept pace with public spending.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_016.wav|To continue this long trend is to guarantee tremendous social, cultural, political, and economic upheavals.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_017.wav|You and I, as individuals, can by borrowing, live beyond our means, but for only a limited period of time.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_018.wav|Why then should we think that collectively as a nation, we are not bound by that same limitation?|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_019.wav|We must act today in order to preserve tomorrow and let there be no misunderstanding.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_020.wav|We are going to begin to act, beginning today.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_021.wav|The economic yields we suffer have come upon us over several decades.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_022.wav|They will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will go away.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_024.wav|In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_025.wav|Government is the problem.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_027.wav|Well, if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else?|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_028.wav|All of us together, in and out of government, must bear the burden.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_029.wav|The solutions we seek must be equitable with no one group singled out to pay a higher price.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_030.wav|We hear much of special interest groups.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_031.wav|Well, our concern must be for a special interest group that has been too long neglected.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_032.wav|It knows no sectional boundaries or ethnic and racial divisions, and it crosses political party lines.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_034.wav|Professionals, industrialists, shopkeepers, clerks, cabbys, and truck drivers.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_035.wav|They are, in short, we the people.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_036.wav|This breed called Americans.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_038.wav|Putting America back to work means putting all Americans back to work.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_039.wav|Ending inflation means freeing all Americans from the terror of runaway living costs.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_040.wav|All must share in the productive work of this new beginning and all must share in the bounty of a revived economy.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_042.wav|So as we begin, let us take inventory.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_043.wav|We are a nation that has a government, not the other way around, and this makes us special among the nations of the earth.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_044.wav|Our government has no power except that granted it by the people.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_045.wav|It is time to check and reverse the growth of government which shows signs of having grown beyond the consent of the governed.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_047.wav|It is rather to make it work.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_048.wav|Work with us, not over us, to stand by our side, not ride on our back.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_049.wav|Government can and must provide opportunity, not smother it, foster productivity, not stifle it.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_050.wav|If we look to the answer, as to why for so many years we achieved so much, prospered as no other people on earth.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_051.wav|It was because here in this land we unleashed the energy and individual genius of man to a greater extent than has ever been done before.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_052.wav|Freedom and the dignity of the individual have been more available and assured here than in any other place on earth.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_053.wav|The price for this freedom at times has been high, but we have never been unwilling to pay that price.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_055.wav|It is time for us to realize that we are too great a nation to limit ourselves to small dreams.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_056.wav|We are not, as some would have us believe, doomed to an inevitable decline.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_057.wav|I do not believe in a fate that will fall on us no matter what we do.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_058.wav|I do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we do nothing.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_059.wav|So with all the creative energy at our command, let us begin an era of national renewal.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_060.wav|Let us renew our determination, our courage, and our strength, and let us renew our faith and our hope.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_061.wav|We have every right to dream heroic dreams.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_062.wav|Those who say that we are in a time when there are no heroes, they just don't know where to look.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_063.wav|You can see heroes every day going in and out of factory gates.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_064.wav|Others a handful in number, produce enough food to feed all of us, and then the world beyond.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_065.wav|You meet heroes across a counter and they are on both sides of that counter.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_066.wav|There are entrepreneurs with faith in themselves and faith in an idea who create new jobs, new wealth, and opportunity.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_068.wav|Their patriotism is quiet but deep.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_069.wav|Their values sustain our national life.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_070.wav|Now I have used the words they and they are in speaking of these heroes.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_073.wav|How can we love our country and not love our countrymen and loving them?|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_074.wav|Reach out a hand when they fall.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_075.wav|Heal them when they are sick and provide opportunity to make themselves sufficient so they will be equally in fact and not just in theory.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_076.wav|Can we solve the problems confronting us?|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_077.wav|Well, the answer is an unequivocal and emphatic yes.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_079.wav|In the days ahead, I will propose removing the roadblocks that have slowed our economy and reduced productivity.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_080.wav|Steps will be taken aimed at restoring the balance between the various levels of government.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_081.wav|Progress may be slow, measured in inches and feet, not miles, but we will progress.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_084.wav|On you depend the fortunes of America.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_085.wav|You are to decide the important question upon which rest the happiness and the liberty of millions yet unborn.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_086.wav|Act worthy of yourselves.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_088.wav|And as we renew ourselves here in our own land, we will be seen as having greater strength throughout the world.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_089.wav|We will again be the exemplar of freedom and a beacon of hope for those who do not now have freedom.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_090.wav|To those neighbors and allies who share our freedom, we will strengthen our historic ties and assure them of our support and firm commitment.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_091.wav|We will match loyalty with loyalty.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_092.wav|We will strive for mutually beneficial relations.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_093.wav|We will not use our friendship to impose on their sovereignty, for our own sovereignty is not for sale.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_095.wav|We will negotiate for it, sacrifice for it, we will not surrender for it now or ever.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_096.wav|Our reluctance for conflicts should not be misjudged as a failure of will.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_097.wav|When action is required to preserve our national security, we will act.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_100.wav|It is a weapon our adversaries in today's world do not have.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_101.wav|It is a weapon that we as Americans do have.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_102.wav|Let that be understood by those who practice terrorism and pray upon their neighbors.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_103.wav|And for that, I'm deeply grateful.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_104.wav|We are a nation under God, and I believe God intended for us to be free.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_105.wav|It would be fitting and good, I think, if on each inaugural day and future years, it should be declared a day of prayer.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_106.wav|This is the first time in our history that this ceremony has been held as you've been told on this west front of the Capitol.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_107.wav|Standing here, one faces a magnificent vista opening up on this city's special beauty and history.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_108.wav|At the end of this open mall are those shrines to the giants on whose shoulders we stand.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_110.wav|He led America out of revolutionary victory into infant nationhood.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_111.wav|After one side, the stateless memorial to Thomas Jefferson, a declaration of independence flames with his eloquence.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_114.wav|They add up to only a tiny fraction of the price that has been paid for our freedom.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_115.wav|Each one of those markers is a monument to the kind of hero I spoke of earlier.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_118.wav|There on the western front, he was killed trying to carry a message between battalions under heavy artillery fire.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_119.wav|We're told that on his body was found a diary.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_120.wav|On the flyleaf, under the heading My Pledge, he had written these words,|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_121.wav|America must win this war.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_123.wav|The crisis we are facing today does not require of us, the kind of sacrifice that Martin Treptow and so many thousands of others were called upon to make.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_125.wav|To believe that together with God's help we can and will resolve the problems which now confront us.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_126.wav|And after all, why shouldn't we believe that?|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_127.wav|We are Americans.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_001.wav|I congratulate all of you who are members of this historic 100th Congress of the United States of America.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_003.wav|However, we must always remember that our Constitution is to be celebrated not for being old, but for being young.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_004.wav|Young with the same energy, spirit and promise that filled each eventful day in Philadelphia State House.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_005.wav|We will be guided tonight by their acts and we will be guided forever by their words.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_006.wav|Now, forgive me, but I can't resist sharing a story from those historic days.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_008.wav|Governors of states were called excellency.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_009.wav|Justices and chancellors had reserved for them honorable with a capital H.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_010.wav|For Congressman, it was honorable with a small H.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_011.wav|And all others were referred to as the following respectable characters.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_012.wav|To declare that each of you must never be titled less than honorable.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_013.wav|And please join me in warm congratulations to the Speaker of the House.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_014.wav|Then as now, the Speakership had changed hands and another great son of Texas, Sam Rayburn.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_015.wav|Mr. Sam sat in your chair.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_016.wav|I cannot find better words than those used by President Eisenhower that evening.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_017.wav|He said, we shall have much to do together.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_018.wav|I am sure that we will get it done and that we shall do it in harmony and goodwill.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_020.wav|And I am confident that along with Republican leaders Bob Michael and Bob Dole, this Congress can make history.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_021.wav|Well, the results are something which we can all be proud.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_022.wav|Our inflation rate is now the lowest in a quarter of a century.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_024.wav|The unemployment rate still too high is the lowest in nearly seven years, and our people have created nearly 13 million new jobs.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_025.wav|Over 61 percent of everyone, over the age of 16, male and female is employed, the highest percentage on record.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_026.wav|Most important, America is at peace tonight, and freedom is on the march.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_027.wav|And we've done much these past years to restore our defenses, our alliances, and our leadership in the world.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_028.wav|I took a risk with regard to our action in Iran.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_029.wav|It did not work, and for that I assumed full responsibility.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_030.wav|The goals were worthy.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_031.wav|I do not believe it was wrong to try to establish contacts with a country of strategic importance, or to try to save lives.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_032.wav|And certainly it was not wrong what we wished, and serious mistakes were trying, made in trying to do so.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_033.wav|We will get to the bottom of this, and I will take whatever action is called for.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_034.wav|But in debating the past, in debating the past we must do not deny ourselves the successes of the future.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_036.wav|And the nation and the world are watching to see if we go forward together in the national interest or if we let partisanship weaken us.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_037.wav|And let there be no mistake about American policy.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_038.wav|We will not sit idly by if our interests or our friends in the Middle East are threatened, nor will we yield the terrorist blackmail.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_039.wav|And now ladies and gentlemen of the Congress, why don't we get to work?|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_040.wav|The world is a safer place.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_041.wav|Earlier this month I submitted a budget to defend America and maintain our momentum to make up for neglect in the last decade.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_042.wav|I ask you to vote out a defense and foreign affairs budget that says yes to protecting our country.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_043.wav|While the world is safer, it is not safe.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_044.wav|Since 1970, the Soviets have invested $500 billion more on their military forces than we have.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_047.wav|Clients like Syria, Vietnam, Cuba, Libya, Angola, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, and Nicaragua.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_050.wav|Afghanistan yet it continues a brutal war and props up a regime whose days are clearly numbered.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_052.wav|In Central America too, the cause of freedom is being tested, and our resolve is being tested there as well.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_053.wav|Here especially, the world is watching to see how this nation responds.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_054.wav|Today, over 90% of the people of Latin America live in democracy.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_055.wav|Democracy is on the march in Central and South America.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_056.wav|Communist Nicaragua is the odd man out, suppressing the church, the press, and democratic dissent, and promoting subversion in the region.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_057.wav|We support diplomatic efforts, but these efforts can never succeed if the Sandinistas win their war against the Nicaraguan people.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_058.wav|Our commitment to a Western hemisphere, safe from aggression, did not occur by spontaneous generation on the day that we took office.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_059.wav|It began with the Monroe Doctrine in 1823 and continues our historic bipartisan American policy.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_061.wav|President Truman was very blunt.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_062.wav|International communism seeks to crush and undermine and destroy the independence of the Americans.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_063.wav|We cannot let that happen here.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_064.wav|And John F. Kennedy made clear that communist domination in this hemisphere can never and then suspended it.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_065.wav|We won't know how my words tonight will be reported there for one simple reason.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_066.wav|There is no free press in Nicaragua.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_068.wav|And so we always remain open to more constructive relations with the Soviet Union.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_069.wav|But more responsible Soviet conduct around the world is a key element of the US Soviet agenda.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_070.wav|Progress is also required in the other items of our agenda as well.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_071.wav|Real respect for human rights and more open contacts between our societies and, of course, arms reduction.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_073.wav|It's the path for both sides to a safer future, a system that defends human life instead of threatening it.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_074.wav|SDI will go forward.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_075.wav|The United States has made serious, fair, and far-reaching proposals to the Soviet Union, and this is a moment of rare opportunity for arms reduction.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_076.wav|But I will need an American negotiator's in Geneva, will need Congress support.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_077.wav|In acting the Soviet negotiating position into American law would not be the way to win a good agreement.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_078.wav|I will veto any effort that undercuts our national security.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_080.wav|Our basic trade policy remains the same.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_081.wav|We remain opposed as ever to protectionism because America's growth and future depend on trade.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_082.wav|But we will insist on trade that is fair and free.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_083.wav|We are always willing to be trade partners.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_084.wav|I begin with a gentle reminder that many of these are simply the incomplete obligations of the past.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_085.wav|The American people deserve to be impatient because we do not yet have the public house in order.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_086.wav|We have had great success in restoring our economic integrity, and we have rescued our nation from the worst economic mess since the depression.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_087.wav|But there is more to do.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_088.wav|Even though I have submitted it within the Graham Rudman Hollings deficit reduction target, I have seen suggestions that we might post-pone that timetable.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_089.wav|The American people have repeatedly rejected that shop-worn advice.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_090.wav|They know that we do not have deficits because people are taxed too little.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_091.wav|Next month, I will place two additional reforms before the Congress.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_092.wav|We have created a welfare monster that is a shocking indictment of our sense of priorities.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_095.wav|This is the time to reform this outmoded social dinosaur and finally break the poverty trap.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_096.wav|Now, we will never abandon those who, through no fault of their own, must have our help.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_097.wav|It is widely said that America is losing her competitive edge.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_098.wav|Well, that won't happen if we act now.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_099.wav|How well prepared are we to enter the 21st century?|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_100.wav|In my lifetime, America set the standard for the world.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_101.wav|It is now time to determine that we should enter the next century having achieved a level of excellence unsurpassed in history.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_102.wav|We will achieve this first by guaranteeing that government does everything possible to promote America's ability to compete.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_103.wav|Second, we must act as individuals in a quest for excellence that will not be measured by new proposals or billions in new funding.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_104.wav|Rather, it involves an expenditure of American spirit and just plain American grit.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_105.wav|The Congress will soon receive my comprehensive proposals to enhance our competitiveness, including new science and technology centers.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_106.wav|Competitiveness also means giving our farmers a shot at participating fairly and fully in a changing world market.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_107.wav|Preparing for the future must begin as always with our children.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_108.wav|We need to set for them new and more rigorous goals.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_109.wav|We must demand more of ourselves and our children by raising literacy levels dramatically by the year 2000.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_111.wav|Finally, let's stop suppressing the spiritual core of our national being.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_112.wav|Our nation could not have been conceived without divine help.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_113.wav|Why is it that we can build a nation with our prayers, but we can't use a school room for voluntary prayer, but must go next to the workplace.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_114.wav|More than 20 million new jobs will be created before the new century unfolds, and by then our economy should be able to provide a job for everyone who wants to work.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_117.wav|Agriculture and other subjects.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_118.wav|The Congress can give us these tools, but to make these tools work, it really comes down to just being our best, and that's the core of American greatness.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_119.wav|The responsibility of freedom presses us toward higher knowledge, and I believe moral and spiritual greatness.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_121.wav|Excellence is what makes freedom ring, and isn't that what we do best.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_122.wav|We're entering our third century now, but is wrong to judge our nation by its years.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_124.wav|The United States Constitution is the impassioned and inspired vehicle by which we travel through history.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_126.wav|I won't count if you don't.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_127.wav|Nothing has been so heartwarming to me as speaking to America's young, and the little ones especially, so fresh-faced and so eager to know.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_128.wav|Well, from time to time, I've been with them they will ask about our Constitution, and I hope you members of Congress will not deem this a breach of protocol.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_129.wav|If you will permit me to share these thoughts again with the young people who might be listening or watching this evening.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_130.wav|I've read the Constitution of a number of countries, including the Soviet Union.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_131.wav|Now some people are surprised to hear that they have a Constitution, and it even supposedly grants a number of freedoms to its people.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_132.wav|Many countries have written into their Constitution provisions for freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_133.wav|But if this is true, why is the Constitution of the United States so exceptional?|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_134.wav|Well, the difference is so small that it almost escapes you, but it's so great it tells you the whole story in just three words.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_135.wav|We, the people, in those other Constitution, the government tells the people of those countries what they're allowed to do.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_137.wav|Virtually every other revolution in history has just exchanged one set of rulers for another set of rulers.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_142.wav|Because that's the way we are, this unique breed we call Americans.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_143.wav|We, the people, their farmers on tough times, but who never stop feeding a hungry world.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_144.wav|They're the volunteers at the hospital choking back their tears for the hundredth time, caring for a baby struggling for life because of a mother who used drugs.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_145.wav|And you'll forgive me a special memory.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_146.wav|It's a million mothers like Nelly Reagan, who never knew a stranger, or turned a hungry person away from her kitchen door.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_147.wav|We the people, they refute last week's television commentary downgrading our optimism and our idealism.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_149.wav|You know they're Americans because their spirit is as big as the universe, and their hearts are bigger than their spirits.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_150.wav|We the people, starting the third century of a dream and standing up to some cynic who's trying to tell us we're not going to get any better.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_151.wav|Are we at the end?|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_152.wav|Well, I can't tell it any better than the real thing.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_153.wav|A story recorded by James Madison from the final moments of the Constitutional Convention, September 17, 1787.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_155.wav|At the back of that chair was painted the picture of a son on the horizon, and turning those sitting next to him.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_156.wav|Franklin observed that artists found it difficult in their painting to distinguish between arising and a setting son.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_158.wav|And this is what he said.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_159.wav|I have often looked at that picture behind the president without being able to tell whether it was a rising or setting son.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_160.wav|But now at length I have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a setting son.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_161.wav|But you can bet it's rising because my fellow citizens America isn't finished.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_162.wav|Her dead best days have just begun.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_163.wav|Thank you.|1|76
wavs/reagan_1994_001.wav|I am delighted to congratulate all of you on Young America's foundation's 15th annual National Conservative Student Conference.|1|83
wavs/reagan_1994_002.wav|Each year after my election in 1980, we hosted Young America's foundation at the White House.|1|83
wavs/reagan_1994_003.wav|Together we work to accomplish much of what has come to be known as the Reagan Revolution.|1|83
wavs/reagan_1994_004.wav|Much has been achieved since Young America's foundations first conferences in 1979 and 1980.|1|83
wavs/reagan_1994_005.wav|At that time, Soviet armies were on the march in Poland and Afghanistan.|1|83
wavs/reagan_1994_007.wav|American diplomats were held hostage.|1|83
wavs/reagan_1994_008.wav|American prestige was at an all time low and our leaders talked about an American malaise.|1|83
wavs/reagan_1994_009.wav|Well, you and I knew better.|1|83
wavs/reagan_1994_011.wav|A few months after our election, I went to the University of Notre Dame and warned of the evil empire.|1|83
wavs/reagan_1994_014.wav|The fight against totalitarianism was a grand and noble cause, one that united us all.|1|83
wavs/reagan_1994_016.wav|I know young America's foundation was active in those efforts and I congratulate you on your vigilance.|1|83
wavs/reagan_1994_017.wav|I know too that you have since turned your efforts to reforming our campuses.|1|83
wavs/reagan_1994_018.wav|Your work is needed as much now as it was when you inaugurated your conferences.|1|83
wavs/reagan_1994_019.wav|Today, political correctness has replaced pro-Marxist ideas as the conventional wisdom on too many campuses.|1|83
wavs/reagan_1994_020.wav|The sharpest weapons in this new struggle are a razor-sharp wit and well-honed disdain for intellectual intolerance.|1|83
wavs/reagan_1994_022.wav|What a distortion of the great chaotic yet essential marketplace of ideas.|1|83
wavs/reagan_1994_023.wav|I urge you to continue your work to ensure that our campuses become a true marketplace of ideas.|1|83
wavs/reagan_1994_024.wav|Freedom would not have come to Eastern Europe without the perseverance of many beleaguered freedom fighters.|1|83
wavs/reagan_1994_027.wav|I know the conference will send you back to your campuses better, informed, motivated, and trained.|1|83
wavs/reagan_1994_028.wav|Your work is vital to the future of the nation.|1|83
wavs/reagan_1994_029.wav|Nancy and I congratulate you on your commitment and wish you well in the days ahead.|1|83
wavs/reagan_1994_030.wav|Thank you and God bless you.|1|83
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_001.wav|no hood,|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_002.wav|I'm glad you asked that question because I know it's on many people's minds.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_003.wav|I aborted an investigation.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_004.wav|I know that CIA is already going forward with one.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_006.wav|And he drew up this manual.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_007.wav|It was turned over to the agency head in of the CIA in Nicaragua.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_008.wav|Uh, to be printed and a number of pages were excised by that agency head there, the man in charge.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_009.wav|And he sent it on up here to CIA where more pages were excised before it was printed.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_011.wav|Now those that details as we have them.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_013.wav|We'll take the proper action at the proper time.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_014.wav|I was very interested to hear about Central America and our process down there.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_016.wav|Including diplomatic processes throughout Central America and working closely with the Contedora group.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_018.wav|But if guilt is established, whoever is guilty, we will treat with that situation.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_020.wav|And they will be removed.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_021.wav|Yes, I have so many things there to respond to.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_022.wav|I'm going to pick out something you said earlier.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_023.wav|You've been all over the country repeating something that I will admit the press has also been repeating that I believe that nuclear missiles could be fired and then called back.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_024.wav|I never ever conceived of such a thing.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_025.wav|I never said any such thing in a discussion of our strategic arms negotiations.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_026.wav|I said that submarines carrying missiles and airplanes carrying.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_027.wav|And they were not just conventional missiles, but more conventional type weapons, not as destabilizing as the land-based missiles.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_028.wav|And that they were all so weapons that or carriers that if they were sent out and there was a change, you could call them back before they had launched their missiles.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_030.wav|I think is as ridiculous as the as the whole concept has been.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_031.wav|So thank you for giving me a chance to straighten the record.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_032.wav|I'm sure that you appreciate that.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_033.wav|I have said a number of occasions exactly what I believe about the Soviet Union.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_034.wav|I retract nothing that I have said.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_035.wav|I believe that many of the things they have done are evil in any concept of morality that we have.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_036.wav|But I also recognize that as the two great superpowers in the world, we have to live with each other.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_037.wav|And I told Mr. Grameco, we don't like their system, they don't like ours.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_038.wav|And we're not going to change their system and they sure better not try to change ours.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_039.wav|But between us, we can either destroy the world or we can save it.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_041.wav|And I think that perhaps we established a little better understanding.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_042.wav|I think that in dealing with the Soviet Union, one has to be realistic.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_044.wav|And the result was unilateral disarmament.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_045.wav|We canceled the B1 under the previous administration.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_046.wav|What did we get for it?|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_048.wav|The Soviet Union has been engaged in the biggest military build up in the history of man.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_049.wav|At the same time that we tried the policy of unilateral disarmament, of weakness, if you will.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_050.wav|And now we are putting up a defense of our own and I've made it very plain to them.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_051.wav|We seek no superiority.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_052.wav|We simply are going to provide a deterrent so that it would be too costly for them if they are nursing any ideas of aggression against us.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_053.wav|Now they claim they are not.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_054.wav|And I made it plain to them.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_056.wav|But this, there's been no change in my attitude at all.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_057.wav|I just thought when I came into office, it was time that there was some realistic talk to and about the Soviet Union.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_058.wav|And we did get their attention.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_059.wav|Now you've added a hypothetical there at the end to Cal.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_060.wav|About that where we would send troops into fight.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_061.wav|I am not going to make the decisions to what the tactics could be.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_062.wav|But obviously there are a number of areas in the world that are of importance to us.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_063.wav|Because one is the Middle East.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_064.wav|And that is of interest to the whole Western world and the industrialized nations because of the great supply of energy on which so many depend there.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_065.wav|The, our neighbors here in America are vital to us.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_067.wav|From Angola.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_068.wav|So I can say there are a great many interest.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_069.wav|I believe that we have a great interest in the Pacific Basin.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_070.wav|That is where I think the future of the world lies.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_071.wav|But I am not going to pick out one and in advance hypothetically say, oh yes, we would send troops there.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_072.wav|Yes, I am not going to continue trying to respond to these repetitions of the falsehoods that have already been stated here.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_074.wav|And that is an image of strength.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_075.wav|Except that if he had had his way when the Nimitz was being planned, he would have been deep in the water out there because there wouldn't have been any Nimitz to stand on.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_076.wav|He was against it.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_077.wav|He was against the F-14 fighter.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_078.wav|He was against the M-1 tank.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_079.wav|He was against the B-1 bomber.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_080.wav|He wanted to cut the salary of the all of the military.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_081.wav|He wanted to bring home half of the American forces in Europe.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_082.wav|And he has a record of weakness with regard to our national defense that is second to none.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_083.wav|Indeed, he was on that side virtually throughout all his years in the Senate.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_084.wav|But Andy opposed even the President Carter when toward the end of his term President Carter wanted to increase the defense budget.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_085.wav|No more than I don't agree to all of those things.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_088.wav|Israel could not be blamed for that.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_089.wav|Those terrorists had been violating their northern border consistently and Israel chased them all the way to there.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_092.wav|And we were succeeding.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_093.wav|We were there for the better part of a year.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_094.wav|Our position happened to be at the airport.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_095.wav|All of the were occasional snipings and sometimes some artillery fire.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_096.wav|But we did not engage in conflict that was out of line with our mission.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_097.wav|I will never send troops anywhere in a mission of that kind.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_098.wav|Without telling them that if somebody shoots at them, they can darn well shoot back.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_099.wav|And this is what we did.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_100.wav|We never initiated any kind of action.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_101.wav|We defended ourselves there.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_102.wav|But we were succeeding to the point that the Lebanese government had been organized.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_103.wav|If you remember there were the meetings in Geneva in which they began to meet with the hostile, factual forces and try to put together some kind of a peace plan.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_104.wav|We were succeeding and that was why the terrorist acts began.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_106.wav|And so the terrorist acts began and led to the one great tragedy when they were killed in that suicide bombing the building.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_107.wav|Then the multilateral force withdrew for only one reason.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_108.wav|We withdrew because we were no longer able to carry out the mission for which we had been sent in.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_109.wav|But we went in in the interest of peace and to keep Israel and Syria from getting into the sixth war between them.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_110.wav|And I have no apologies for our going on a peace mission.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_111.wav|Morton, no.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_112.wav|I think there's a great difference between the government of Iran threatening our diplomatic personnel.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_113.wav|And there is a government that you can see and can put your hand on.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_114.wav|In the terrorist situation, there are terrorist factions all over in a recent 30-day period.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_115.wav|37 terrorist acts in 20 countries have been committed.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_116.wav|The most recent has been the one in Brighton.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_117.wav|In dealing with terrorist, yes, we want to retaliate.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_119.wav|I have just signed legislation to add to our ability to deal along with our allies with this terrorist problem.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_120.wav|And it's going to take all the nations together just as when we banded together, we pretty much resolved the whole problem of hijack, sky jackings some time ago.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_121.wav|Well, the red light went on.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_122.wav|I could have gone on forever.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_123.wav|Yes, this had to do with our dishonorment talks.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_125.wav|So we thought that it would be simpler to negotiate first with those and then we made it plain a second phase take up the submarine launched the airborne missiles.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_127.wav|And therefore they wanted to take up all three and we agreed we said all right if that's what you want to do.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_128.wav|But it was a surprise to us because they outnumbered us 64 to 36 and submarines and 20% more bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles than we had.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_129.wav|So why should we believe that they had placed that much real more reliance on land based.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_130.wav|But even after we gave in and said all right, let's discuss it all.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_131.wav|They walked away from the table.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_133.wav|Yes, I know to come as a surprise Mr. Mondale, but I am in charge.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_134.wav|And as a matter of fact, we haven't avoided arms control talks with the Soviet Union very early in my administration.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_135.wav|I proposed and I think something that had never been proposed by any previous administration.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_137.wav|When they protested that and suggested a smaller number perhaps I went along with that.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_139.wav|And it wasn't me that turned it down the Soviet Union dis about it.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_140.wav|And we believe me supported the Simpson-Mazoli bill strongly and the bill that came out of the Senate.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_141.wav|However, there were things added in the House side that we felt made it less of a good bill as a matter of fact made it a bad bill.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_142.wav|And in conference we stayed with them in conference all the way to where even Senator Simpson did not want the bill in the manner in which it would come out of the conference committee.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_143.wav|There were a number of things in there that we can that bill I can't go into detail about them here.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_144.wav|But it is true our borders are out of control.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_145.wav|It is also true that this has been a situation in our borders back through a number of administrations.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_146.wav|And I supported this bill.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_149.wav|There is another employer that we shouldn't be so concerned about.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_151.wav|And with none of the benefits that we think are normal and natural for workers in our country.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_152.wav|And the individuals can't complain because of their illegal status.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_153.wav|We don't think that those people should be allowed to continue operating free.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_154.wav|And this was why the provisions that we had in with regard to sanctions and so forth.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_158.wav|No, as a matter of fact the population explosion, if you look at the actual figures has been vastly exaggerated.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_160.wav|But it's almost like going back to the Malthusian theory when even then they were saying that everyone would starve with the limited population they had then.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_162.wav|And this is what we're trying to work out not only to protect our own borders but to have some kind of fairness and recognition of that problem.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_165.wav|So I have never seriously warned and said we must plan according to Armageddon.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_169.wav|Why not?|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_173.wav|I think that would be the greatest use of a defensive weapon.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_178.wav|But we turned it over to a maniacal fanatic who has slaughtered thousands and thousands of people calling it executions.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_190.wav|The question before you comes down to this.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_192.wav|And that's going to continue to be strong.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_194.wav|Several years ago I was given an assignment to write a letter.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_195.wav|It was to go into a time capsule and would be read in a hundred years when that time capsule was opened.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_198.wav|And I found myself wondering what it would be like for someone wondering if someone a hundred years from now would be driving down that highway and if they would see the same thing.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_199.wav|And with that thought I realized what a job I had with that letter.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_200.wav|I would be writing a letter to people who know everything there is to know about us.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_201.wav|We know nothing about them.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_202.wav|They would know all about our problems.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_203.wav|They would know how we solve them and whether our solution was beneficial to them down through the years or whether it hurt them.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_205.wav|And then I thought to myself what are they going to say about us?|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_206.wav|What are those people a hundred years from now going to think?|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_207.wav|They will know whether we use those weapons or not.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_208.wav|Well what they will say about us a hundred years from now depends on how we keep our rendezvous with destiny.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_211.wav|George Bush, who I think is one of the finest vice presidents this country has ever had.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_212.wav|George Bush and I have crossed the country and we've had in these last few months a wonderful experience.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_213.wav|We have met young America.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1988_11_11_001.wav|those who live today remember those who do not and those who know freedom|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_11_11_002.wav|remember today|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_11_11_003.wav|those who gave up life for freedom|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_11_11_004.wav|today in honor of the dead|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_11_11_005.wav|we conduct ceremonies|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_11_11_006.wav|we lay reads|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_11_11_008.wav|we could not forget them even if they were not our own|1|77
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_001.wav|my fellow Americans,|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_002.wav|the scenes that the whole world witnessed this past weekend were among the most heart-rending in the long nightmare of Lebanon's agony.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_003.wav|millions of us have seen pictures of the Palestinian victims of this tragedy.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_004.wav|there's little that words can add, but there are actions we can and must take to bring that nightmare to an end.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_005.wav|it's not enough for us to view this as some remote event in which we ourselves are not involved.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_006.wav|for our friends in Lebanon and Israel,|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_007.wav|for our friends in Europe and elsewhere in the Middle East, and for us as Americans.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_008.wav|this tragedy, horrible as it is, reminds us of the absolute imperative of bringing peace to that troubled country in region.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_009.wav|by working for peace in the Middle East, we serve the cause of world peace and the future of mankind.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_010.wav|for the criminals who did this deed, no punishment is enough to remove the blot of their crime.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_011.wav|but for the rest of us, there are things that we can learn and things that we must do.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_012.wav|the people of Lebanon must have learned that the cycle of massacre upon massacre must end.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_013.wav|children are not avenged by the murder of other children.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_014.wav|Israel must have learned that there is no way it can impose its own solutions on hatreds as deep and bitter as those that produce this tragedy.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_015.wav|if it seeks to do so, it will only sink more deeply into the quagmire that looms before it.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_016.wav|those outsiders who have fed the flames of civil war in Lebanon for so many years need to learn that the fire will consume them too if it is not put out.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_017.wav|and we must all rededicate ourselves to the cause of peace.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_018.wav|I re-emphasize my call for early progress to solve the Palestinian issue and repeat the U.S. proposals which are now even more urgent.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_019.wav|for now is not the time for talk alone.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_021.wav|our basic objectives in Lebanon have not changed for they are the objectives of the government and the people of Lebanon themselves.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_022.wav|first and foremost, we seek the restoration of a strong and stable central government in that country, brought into being by orderly constitutional processes.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_023.wav|Lebanon elected a new president two short weeks ago only to see him murdered even before he could assume his office.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_024.wav|this week a distressed Lebanon will again be electing a new president.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_025.wav|may God grant him safety as well as the wisdom encouraged to lead his country into a new and happer area.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_026.wav|the international community has an obligation to assist the government of Lebanon in reasserting authority over all its territory.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_027.wav|foreign forces and armed factions have too long obstructed the legitimate role of the government of Lebanon's security forces.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_028.wav|we must pave the way for withdrawal of foreign forces.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_029.wav|the place to begin this task is in Beirut.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_030.wav|the Lebanese government must be permitted to restore internal security in its capital.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_031.wav|it cannot do this if foreign forces remain in or near Beirut.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_032.wav|with this goal in mind, I have consulted with our French and Italian allies.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_033.wav|we have agreed to form a new multinational force similar to the one which served so well last month.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_034.wav|with the mission of enabling the Lebanese government to resume full sovereignty over its capital.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_035.wav|the essential precondition for extending its control over the entire country.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_036.wav|the Lebanese government with the support of its people requested this help.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_037.wav|for this multinational force to succeed, it is essential that Israel withdraw from Beirut.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_038.wav|with the expected cooperation of all parties, the multinational force will return to Beirut for a limited period of time.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_039.wav|its purpose is not to act as a police force, but to make it possible for the lawful authorities of Lebanon to discharge those duties for themselves.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_040.wav|secretary Schultz on my behalf has also reiterated our views to the government of Israel through its ambassador in Washington.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_042.wav|the participation of American forces in Beirut will again be for a limited period.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_043.wav|but I have concluded there is no alternative to their returning to Lebanon if that country is to have a chance to stand on its own feet.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_044.wav|peace in Beirut is only a first step.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_045.wav|together with the people of Lebanon, we seek the removal of all foreign military forces from that country.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_046.wav|the departure of all foreign forces at the request of the Lebanese authorities has been widely endorsed by everyone.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_047.wav|and the Arab as well as other states.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_048.wav|Israel and Syria have both indicated that they have no territorial ambitions in Lebanon and are prepared to withdraw.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_049.wav|it is now urgent that specific arrangements for withdrawal of all foreign forces be agreed upon.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_050.wav|this must happen very soon.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_051.wav|the legitimate security concerns of neighboring states, including particularly the safety of Israel's northern population, must be provided for.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_052.wav|but this is not a difficult task if the political will is there.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_053.wav|the Lebanese people must be allowed to chart their own future.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_054.wav|they must rely solely on Lebanese armed forces who are willing and able to bring security to their country.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_055.wav|they must be allowed to do so and the sooner the better.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_056.wav|Ambassador Draper, who has been in close consultation with the parties concerned in Lebanon, will remain in the area to work for the full implementation of our proposal.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_057.wav|Ambassador Habib will join him, will represent me at the inauguration of the new president of Lebanon, and will consult with the leaders in the area.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_058.wav|he will return promptly to Washington to report to me.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_059.wav|early in the summer, our government met its responsibility to help resolve a severe crisis and to relieve the Lebanese people of the crushing burden.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_060.wav|we succeeded.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_061.wav|recent events have produced new problems, and we must again assume our responsibility.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_062.wav|I am especially anxious to end the agony of Lebanon because it is both right and in our national interest.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_063.wav|but I'm also determined to press ahead in the broader effort to achieve peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_065.wav|we will not be discouraged or deterred in our efforts to seek peace in Lebanon and adjust and lasting peace throughout them at least.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_066.wav|all of us must learn the appropriate lessons from this tragedy and assume the responsibilities that it imposes upon us.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_067.wav|we owe it to ourselves and to our children.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_068.wav|the whole world will be a safer place when this region which is known so much trouble can begin to no peace instead.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_069.wav|both our purpose and our actions are peaceful and we're taking them in a spirit of international cooperation.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_070.wav|so tonight, I ask for your prayers and your support as our country continues its vital role as a leader for world peace.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_071.wav|a role that all of us as Americans can be proud of.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_001.wav|Mr. Secretary General,|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_003.wav|Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen,|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_004.wav|I speak today as both a citizen of the United States and of the world.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_005.wav|I come with a heartfelt wishes of my people for peace, bearing honest proposals and looking for genuine progress.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_006.wav|Dag Hammershold said 24 years ago this month, we meet in a time of peace which is no peace.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_007.wav|His words are as true today as they were then.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_008.wav|More than a hundred disputes have disturbed the peace among nations since World War II, and today the threat of nuclear disaster hangs over the lives of all our people.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_009.wav|The Bible tells us there will be a time for peace, but so far this century mankind has failed to find it.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_010.wav|The United Nations is dedicated to world peace, and its charter clearly prohibits the international use of force.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_011.wav|Yet the tide of belligerence continues to rise.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_012.wav|The charter's influence has weakened even in the four years since the first special session on disarmament.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_013.wav|We must not only condemn aggression, we must enforce the dictates of our charter and resume the struggle for peace.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_014.wav|The record of history is clear, citizens of the United States resort to force reluctantly and only when they must.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_015.wav|Our foreign policy, as President Eisenhower once said, is not difficult to state.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_016.wav|We are for peace, first, last and always for very simple reasons.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_018.wav|He said to those who challenged the truth of those words, let me point out at the end of World War II, we were the only undamaged industrial power in the world.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_019.wav|Our military supremacy was unquestioned.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_020.wav|We had harnessed the atom and had the ability to unleash its destructive poverse anywhere in the world.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_021.wav|In short, we could have achieved world domination, but that was contrary to the character of our people.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_022.wav|Instead, we wrote a new chapter in the history of mankind.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_023.wav|We used our power and wealth to rebuild the war-ravaged economies of the world, both east and west, including those nations who had been our enemies.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_025.wav|America has no territorial ambitions.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_026.wav|We occupy no countries, and we have built no walls to lock our people in.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_027.wav|Our commitment to self-determination, freedom and peace is the very soul of America.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_028.wav|That commitment is as strong today as it ever was.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_029.wav|The United States has fought four wars in my lifetime.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_030.wav|In each, we struggled to defend freedom and democracy.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_031.wav|We were never the aggressors.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_034.wav|But since coming to the presidency, the enormity of the responsibility of this office has made my commitment even deeper.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_035.wav|I believe that responsibility is shared by all of us here today.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_037.wav|The beach at the base of that cliff is called San Laurent.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_038.wav|But countless American family bibles have written it in the fly leaf and know it as Omaha Beach.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_040.wav|At the end of just one day of battle, 10,500 Americans were wounded, missing or killed in what became known as the Normandy Landing.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_041.wav|The statue atop that cliff is called the Spirit of American Youth Rising From the Waves.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_042.wav|Its image of sacrifice is almost too powerful to describe.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_043.wav|The pain of war is still vivid in our national memory.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_045.wav|If you want to be brothers, his holiness said, let the arms fall from your hands.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_046.wav|Will we Americans yearn to let them go?|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_047.wav|But we need more than mere words, more than empty promises before we can proceed.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_048.wav|We look around the world and see rampant conflict and aggression.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_049.wav|There are many sources of this conflict, expansionist ambitions, local rivalries, the striving to obtain justice and security.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_050.wav|We must all work to resolve such discord by peaceful means and to prevent them from escalation.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_051.wav|In the nuclear era, the major powers bear a special responsibility to ease these sources of conflict and to refrain from aggression.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_052.wav|And that's why we're so deeply concerned by Soviet conduct.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_054.wav|It includes the takeovers of Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Afghanistan and the ruthless repression of the proud people of Poland.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_056.wav|Commonest atrocities in Southeast Asia, Afghanistan and elsewhere continue to shock the free world as refugees escape to tell of their horror.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_057.wav|The decade of so-called detente witnessed the most massive Soviet build-up of military power in history.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_058.wav|They increased their defense spending by 40 percent, while American defense actually declined in the same real terms.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_059.wav|Soviet aggression and support for violence around the world, if you wrote it, the confidence needed for arms negotiations.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_061.wav|Soviet oppression is not limited to the countries they invade.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_062.wav|At the very time, the Soviet Union is trying to manipulate the peace movement in the West.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_063.wav|It is stifling a budding peace movement at home.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_064.wav|In Moscow, banners are scuttled, buttons are snatched and demonstrators are arrested, when even a few people dare to speak about their fears.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_066.wav|Their promises, she said, are in deep contrast to their performances.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_067.wav|My country learned a bitter lesson in this century.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_068.wav|The scourge of tyranny cannot be stopped with words alone.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_069.wav|So we have embarked on an effort to renew our strength that had fallen dangerously low.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_070.wav|We refuse to become weaker while potential adversaries remain committed to their imperialist adventures.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_071.wav|My people have sent me here today to speak for them as citizens of the world which they truly are.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_072.wav|For them, every nationality represented in this chamber today.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_073.wav|We understand that men and women of every race and creed can and must work together for peace.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_074.wav|We stand ready to take the next steps down the road of cooperation through verifiable arms reduction.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_075.wav|Agreements on arms control and disarmament can be useful in reinforcing peace, but they're not magic.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_076.wav|We should not confuse the signing of agreements with the solving of problems.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_077.wav|Simply collecting agreements will not bring peace.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_078.wav|Agreements genuinely reinforce peace only when they are kept.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_079.wav|Otherwise, we're building a paper castle that will be blown away by the winds of war.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_080.wav|Let me repeat, we need deeds, not words, to convince us of Soviet sincerity should they choose to join us on this path.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_081.wav|Since the end of World War II, the United States has been the leader in serious disarmament and arms control proposals.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_083.wav|The Soviets rejected this plan.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_085.wav|The Soviets rejected this plan.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_086.wav|In 1963, the limited test band treaty came into force.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_087.wav|This treaty ended nuclear weapons testing in the atmosphere, outer space, or underwater by participating nations.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_088.wav|In 1970, the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons took effect.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_090.wav|My country remains deeply committed to those objectives today and to strengthening the non-proliferation framework.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_091.wav|This is essential to international security.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_093.wav|They could have been more meaningful if Soviet actions had shown restraint and commitment to stability at lower levels of force.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_094.wav|The United Nations designated the 1970s as the first disarmament decade, but good intentions were not enough.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_096.wav|We are now in the second disarmament decade.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_097.wav|The task at hand is to assure civilized behavior among nations, to unite behind an agenda of peace.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_098.wav|Over the past seven months, the United States has put forward a broad-based comprehensive series of proposals to reduce the risk of war.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_100.wav|We urge the Soviet Union to date a join with us in this quest.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_101.wav|We must act not for ourselves alone, but for all mankind.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_102.wav|On November 18th of last year, I announced United States objectives in arms control agreements.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_103.wav|They must be equitable and militarily significant.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_104.wav|They must stabilize forces at lower levels, and they must be verifiable.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_105.wav|The United States and its allies have made specific, reasonable and equitable proposals.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_106.wav|In February, our negotiating team in Geneva offered the Soviet Union a draft treaty on intermediate-range nuclear forces.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_108.wav|This proposal would eliminate with one stroke those systems about which both sides have expressed the greatest concern.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_109.wav|The United States is also looking forward to beginning negotiations on strategic arms reductions with the Soviet Union in less than two weeks.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_110.wav|We will work hard to make these talks an opportunity for real progress in our quest for peace.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_111.wav|On May 9th, I announced a phased approach to the reduction of strategic arms.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_112.wav|In a first phase, the number of ballistic missile warheads on each side would be reduced to about 5,000.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_113.wav|No more than half the remaining warheads would be on land-based missiles.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_114.wav|All ballistic missiles would be reduced to an equal level at about one half the current United States number.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_116.wav|We are also prepared to discuss other elements of the strategic balance.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_117.wav|Before I return from Europe last week, I met in bond with the leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_118.wav|We agreed to introduce a major new Western initiative for the Vienna Negotiations on Mutual-Balanced Force Reductions.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_119.wav|Our approach calls for common collective ceilings for both NATO and the Warsaw Treaty Organization.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_120.wav|After seven years, there would be a total of 700,000 ground forces and 900,000 ground and air force personnel combined.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_121.wav|It also includes a package of associated measures to encourage cooperation and verify compliance.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_123.wav|We also urge them to implement the 1975 Helsinki Agreement on security and cooperation in Europe.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_124.wav|Let me stress that for agreements to work, both sides must be able to verify compliance.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_125.wav|The building of mutual confidence in compliance can only be achieved through greater openness.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_126.wav|I encourage the special session on disarmament to endorse the importance of these principles in arms control agreements.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_127.wav|I have instructed our representatives at the 40 Nation Committee on Disarmament to renew emphasis on verification and compliance.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_128.wav|Based on a U.S. proposal, a committee has been formed to examine these issues as they relate to restrictions on nuclear testing.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_129.wav|We are also pressing the need for effective verification provisions in agreements banning chemical weapons.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_130.wav|The use of chemical and biological weapons has long been viewed with revulsion by civilized nations.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_131.wav|No peace-making institution can ignore the use of those dread weapons and still live up to its mission.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_132.wav|The need for a truly effective and verifiable chemical weapons agreement has been highlighted by recent events.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_135.wav|We have repeatedly protested to the Soviet government as well as to the governments of Laos and Vietnam, their use of chemical and toxin weapons.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_137.wav|Evidence of noncompliance with existing arms control agreements underscores the need to approach negotiation of any new agreements with care.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_138.wav|The democracies of the West are open societies.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_139.wav|Information in our defenses is available to our citizens, our elected officials, and the world.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_140.wav|We do not hesitate to inform potential adversaries of our military forces and ask and return for the same information concerning theirs.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_141.wav|The amount and type of military spending by a country is important for the world to know as a measure of its intentions and the threat that country may pose to its neighbors.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_142.wav|The Soviet Union and other closed societies go to extraordinary lengths to hide their true military spending not only from other nations but from their own people.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_143.wav|This practice contributes to distrust and fear about their intentions.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_146.wav|Last Friday in Berlin, I said that I would leave no stone unturned in the effort to reinforce peace and lessen the risk of war.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_147.wav|It's been clear to me, steps should be taken to improve mutual communication, confidence, and lessen the likelihood of misinterpretation.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_152.wav|One of the major items before this conference is the development of a comprehensive program of disarmament.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_153.wav|We support the effort to chart a course of realistic and effective measures in the quest for peace.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_155.wav|America urges you to support the agenda for peace that I have outlined today.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_159.wav|Let us finally make the charter live.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_160.wav|In late spring, 37 years ago, representatives of 50 nations gathered on the other side of this continent in the San Francisco Opera House.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_161.wav|The League of Nations had crumbled, and World War Two still raged, but those men and nations were determined to find peace.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_162.wav|The result was this charter for peace, that is, the framework of the United Nations.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_163.wav|President Harry Truman spoke of the revival of an old faith.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_166.wav|Those words of Harry Truman have special meaning for us today as we live with the potential to destroy civilization.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_167.wav|We must learn to live together in peace, he said.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_168.wav|We must build a new world, a far better world.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_171.wav|The American people believe forging real and lasting peace to be their sacred trust.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_172.wav|But as never forget that such a peace would be a terrible hoax if the world were known.|1|71
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_003.wav|It's true that the social security system has financial problems.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_004.wav|It's also true that these financial problems have been building for more than 20 years and nothing has been done.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_005.wav|I hope to address you on this entire subject in the near future.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_007.wav|I make that pledge to you as your president.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_008.wav|You have no reason to be frightened.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_009.wav|You will continue to receive your checks in the full amount do you.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_011.wav|Now, let us turn to the business at hand.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_012.wav|He's been nearly six months since I first reported to you on the state of the nation's economy.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_013.wav|I'm afraid my message that night was grim and disturbing.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_014.wav|I remember telling you we were in the worst economic mess since the Great Depression.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_015.wav|Prices were continuing to spiral upward.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_016.wav|Unemployment was reaching in tolerable levels and all because government was too big and spent too much of our money.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_017.wav|We're still not out of the woods, but we've made a start.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_018.wav|And we've certainly surprised those long time and somewhat cynical observers of the Washington scene who looked, listened and said, it can never be done.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_019.wav|Washington will never change its spending habits.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_020.wav|Well, something very exciting has been happening here in Washington and you are responsible.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_021.wav|Your voices have been heard.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_022.wav|Millions of you, Democrats, Republicans and Independents from every profession, trade and line of work and from every part of this land.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_023.wav|You sent a message that you wanted a new beginning.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_024.wav|You wanted to change one little, two little word, tattoo letter word, I should say.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_029.wav|And you made history with your telegrams, your letters, your phone calls and yes, personal visits to talk to your elected representatives.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_031.wav|Because of what you did, Republicans and Democrats in the Congress came together and passed them with sweeping cutbacks in the history of the federal budget.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_032.wav|Right now, members of the House and Senate are meeting in a conference committee to reconcile the differences between the two budget cutting bills passed by the House and Senate.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_034.wav|And that doesn't include the additional savings from the hundreds of burdensome regulations already canceled for facing cancellation.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_035.wav|For 19 out of the last 20 years, the federal government has spent more than it took in.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_036.wav|There will be another large deficit in this present year which ends September 30th.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_037.wav|But with our program in place, it won't be quite as big as it might have been.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_038.wav|And starting next year, the deficits will get smaller until in just a few years, the budget can be balanced.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_039.wav|And we hope we can begin whittling at that almost $1 trillion debt that hangs over the future of our children.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_040.wav|Now, so far, I've been talking about only one part of our program for economic recovery, the budget cutting part.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_041.wav|I don't minimize its importance.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_042.wav|Just the fact that Democrats and Republicans could work together as they have proving the strength of our system has created an optimism in our land.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_043.wav|The rate of inflation is no longer in double digit figures.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_045.wav|All of this based on anticipation of our program being adopted and put into operation.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_046.wav|A recent poll shows that we're a year and a half ago, only 24% of our people believe things would get better.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_047.wav|Today, 46% believe they will.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_048.wav|To justify their fate, we must deliver the other part of our program.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_050.wav|Each part of this package is vital.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_051.wav|It cannot be considered piecemeal.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_052.wav|It was proposed as a package and it has been supported as such by the American people.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_053.wav|Only if the Congress passes all of its major components does it have any real chance of success.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_054.wav|This is absolutely essential.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_055.wav|If we're to provide incentives and make capital available for the increased productivity required to provide real permanent jobs for our people.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_056.wav|And let us not forget that the rest of the world is watching America carefully to see how we lack at this critical moment.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_057.wav|I've recently returned from a summit meeting with world leaders in Ottawa, Canada and the message I heard from them was quite clear.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_059.wav|In short, the best way to have a strong foreign policy of growing is to have a strong economy at home.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_060.wav|Now the day after tomorrow, Wednesday, the House of Representatives will begin debate on two tax bells and once again they need to hear from you.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_061.wav|I know that doesn't give you much time, but a great deal is at stake.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_062.wav|A few days ago I was disted here in the office by a Democratic congressman from one of our southern states.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_063.wav|He'd been back in his district and one day one of his constituents asked him where he stood on our economic recovery program.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_064.wav|I outlined that program in an earlier broadcast, particularly the tax cut.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_066.wav|The constituent, a farmer, listened politely until he'd finished and then he said, don't give me an essay.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_067.wav|What I want to know is, are you forum or again him?|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_068.wav|Well, I appreciate the gentleman's support and suggest his questions and message your own representative should hear.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_069.wav|Let me add, those representatives honestly and sincerely want to know your feelings.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_070.wav|They get plenty of input from the special interest groups.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_071.wav|They'd like to hear from their home folks.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_072.wav|Now, let me explain what the situation is and what's it issue.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_073.wav|With our budget cuts, we presented a complete program of reduction in tax rates.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_076.wav|But then to ensure the tax cut is permanent, we call for indexing the tax rates in 1985 which means adjusting them for inflation.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_078.wav|This is called bracket creep.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_079.wav|A bracket creep is in city's tax.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_080.wav|Let me give an example.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_082.wav|But that's before taxes.|1|70
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_001.wav|Well thank you and welcome to the White House.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_002.wav|In a moment, I'll be sitting at that desk, taking up a pen and signing the most sweeping overhaul of tax code in our nation's history.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_003.wav|To all of you here today who've worked so long and hard to see this day come, my thanks and the thanks of a nation go out to you.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_005.wav|They haven't made this the freest country in the mightiest economic force on this planet by shrinking from challenges.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_006.wav|They never gave up and after almost three years of commitment and hard work, one headline in the Washington Post told the whole story.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_007.wav|The impossible became the inevitable and the dream of America's fair share tax plan became a reality.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_013.wav|Our founding fathers designed a democratic form of government to enlist the individual's energies and fashioned a bill of rights to protect its freedoms.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_014.wav|And in so doing, they tapped a spring of hope and creativity that was to completely transform history.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_015.wav|The history of these United States of America is indeed a history of individual achievement.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_017.wav|It was their faith in freedom and love of country that sustained us through trials and hardships and through wars.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_018.wav|And it was their courage and selflessness that enabled us to always prevail.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_021.wav|Now that's the equivalent of multi-millionaires today.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_022.wav|But in our lifetime, we've seen marginal tax rates skyrocket as high as 90% and not even the poor have been spared.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_024.wav|Blatantly unfair, our tax code became a source of bitterness and discouragement for the average taxpayer.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_025.wav|It wasn't too much to call it un-American.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_028.wav|And taxation fell most cruelly on the poor, making a difficult climb up from poverty even harder.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_029.wav|Throughout history, the oppressive hand of government has fallen most heavily on the economic life of the individuals.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_030.wav|And more often than not, it is inflation and taxes that have undermined livelihoods and constrained their freedoms.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_031.wav|We should not forget that this nation of ours began in a revolt against oppressive taxation.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_032.wav|Our founding fathers fought not only for our political rights, but also to secure the economic freedoms without which these political freedoms are no more than a shadow.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_034.wav|We protect the freedom of expression of the author as we should.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_035.wav|But what are the freedom of expression of the entrepreneur whose pen and paper are capital and profits whose book may be a new invention or small business?|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_037.wav|And what about fairness for families?|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_038.wav|It's in our families that America's most important work gets done, raising our next generation.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_039.wav|But over the last 40 years, as inflation has shrunk the personal exemption, families with children have had to shoulder more and more of the tax burden.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_040.wav|With inflation and bracket creep also eroding incomes, many spouses who would rather stay home with their children have been forced to go looking for jobs.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_041.wav|And what of America's promise of hope and opportunity that with hard work even the poorest among us can gain the security and happiness that is the due of all Americans.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_042.wav|You can't put a price tag on the American dream.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_043.wav|That dream is the heart and soul of America.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_044.wav|It's the promise that keeps our nation forever good, and generous, a model and hope to the world.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_045.wav|For all these reasons, this tax bill is less of freedom or a reform, I should say, than a revolution.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_046.wav|Millions of working poor will be dropped from the tax rolls altogether, and families will get a long overdue break with lower rates and an almost double personal exemption.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_047.wav|We're going to make it economical to raise children again.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_049.wav|And that's why I'm certain that the bill I'm signing today is not only an historic overhaul of our tax code and a sweeping victory for fairness.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_050.wav|It's also the best anti-poverty bill, the best pro-family measure, and the best job creation program ever to come out of the Congress of the United States.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_051.wav|And I'll oppose with all my might any attempt to raise tax rates on the American people, and I hope that all here will join with me to make permanent.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_053.wav|But we must also salute those courageous leaders in the Congress who've made this day possible.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_054.wav|To Bob Pachwood, Dan Rostyn Kowski, Russell Long, John Duncan, and Majority Leader Bob Dole,|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_055.wav|to Jack Camp Bob Caston, Bill Bradley, Dick Gephart, who pioneered with their own versions of tax reform.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_057.wav|I feel like we've just played the world series of tax reform and the American people won.|1|75
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_002.wav|It's a great pleasure to be here at Moscow State University, and I want to thank you all for turning out.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_004.wav|Let me say it's also a great pleasure to once again have this opportunity to speak directly to the people of the Soviet Union.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_006.wav|It is a message of peace and goodwill and hope for a growing friendship and closeness between our two peoples.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_007.wav|As you know, I've come to Moscow to meet with one of your most distinguished graduates.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_009.wav|Our discussions, of course, have been focused primarily on many of the important issues of the day.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_010.wav|Issues I want to touch on with you in a few moments.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_011.wav|But first, I want to take a little time to talk to you, much as I would to any group of university students in the United States.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_012.wav|I want to talk not just of the realities of today, but of the possibilities of tomorrow.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_014.wav|It's effects are peaceful, but they will fundamentally alter our world, shatter old assumptions and reshape our lives.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_015.wav|It's easy to underestimate because it's not accompanied by banners or fanfare.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_016.wav|It's been called the technological or information revolution.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_017.wav|And as its emblem, one might take the tiny silicon chip.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_018.wav|No bigger than a fingerprint.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_019.wav|One of these chips has more computing power than a room full of old-style computers.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_021.wav|These micro computers today aid the design of everything from houses to cars to spacecraft.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_022.wav|They even design better and faster computers.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_025.wav|Like a chrysalis, we're emerging from the economy of the industrial revolution.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_027.wav|And the freedom to create is the most precious, natural resource.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_028.wav|Think of that little computer chip.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_030.wav|In the new economy, human invention increasingly makes physical resources obsolete.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_031.wav|We're breaking through the material conditions of existence to a world where man creates his own destiny.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_034.wav|But progress is not foreordained.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_035.wav|The key is freedom, freedom of thought, freedom of information, freedom of communication.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_036.wav|The renowned scientist, scholar, and founding father of this university, Mikhail Loma-Nosef knew that.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_038.wav|You know, one of the first contacts between your country and mine took place between Russian and American explorers.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_039.wav|The Americans were members of Cook's last voyage on an expedition searching for an Arctic passage.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_042.wav|These entrepreneurs and their small enterprises are responsible for almost all the economic growth in the United States.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_043.wav|They are the prime movers of the technological revolution.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_045.wav|Some people, even in my own country, look at the riot of experiment that is the free market and see only waste.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_046.wav|What of all the entrepreneurs that fail?|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_047.wav|Well, many do, particularly the successful ones, often several times.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_048.wav|And if you ask them the secret of their success, they'll tell you it's all that they learned in their struggles along the way.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_049.wav|Yes, it's what they learned from failing, like an athlete in competition or a scholar in pursuit of the truth.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_050.wav|Experience is the greatest teacher.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_052.wav|The fact is bureaucracies are a problem around the world.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_055.wav|If the angel kisses him on his hand, he becomes a handyman.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_056.wav|If he kisses him on his forehead, he becomes bright and clever.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_057.wav|And I've been trying to figure out where the angel kissed you so that you should sit there for so long and do nothing.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_060.wav|At the same time, the growth of democracy has become one of the most powerful political movements of our age.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_061.wav|In Latin America in the 1970s, only a third of the population lived under democratic government.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_062.wav|Today, over 90 percent does.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_063.wav|In the Philippines, in the Republic of Korea, free contested democratic elections are the order of the day.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_064.wav|Throughout the world, free markets are the model for growth.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_065.wav|Democracy is the standard by which governments are measured.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_066.wav|We Americans make no secret of our belief in freedom.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_067.wav|In fact, it's something of a national pastime.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_068.wav|Every four years, the American people choose a new president.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_069.wav|And 1988 is one of those years.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_072.wav|In the end, the people vote.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_073.wav|They decide who will be the next president.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_074.wav|But freedom doesn't begin or end with elections.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_075.wav|Go to any American town to take just an example.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_076.wav|And you will see dozens of churches representing many different beliefs in many places, synagogues and mosques.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_077.wav|And you will see families of every conceivable nationality worshipping together.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_078.wav|Go into any school room.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_081.wav|There, every defendant has the right to a trial by a jury of his peers, usually 12 men and women, common citizens.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_082.wav|They are the ones, the only ones who weigh the evidence and decide on guilt or innocence.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_083.wav|In that court, the accused is innocent until proven guilty.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_084.wav|And the word of a policeman or any official has no greater legal standing than the word of the accused.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_087.wav|March in any demonstration and there are many of them.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_088.wav|The people's right of assembly is guaranteed in the constitution and protected by the police.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_089.wav|Go into any union hall where the members know their right to strike is protected by law.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_090.wav|As a matter of fact, one of the many jobs I had before this one was being president of a union, the screen actors guild.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_091.wav|I led my union out on strike and I'm proud to say we won.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_092.wav|But freedom is more even than this.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_093.wav|Freedom is the right to question and change the established way of doing things.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_094.wav|It is the continuing revolution of the marketplace.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_095.wav|It is the understanding that allows us to recognize shortcomings and seek solutions.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_096.wav|It is the right to put forth an idea scoffed at by the experts and watch it catch fire among the people.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_097.wav|It is the right to stick to dream, to follow your dream or stick to your conscience even if you're the only one in a sea of doubters.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_098.wav|Freedom is the recognition that no single person, no single authority or government has a monopoly on the truth.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_099.wav|But that every individual life is infinitely precious.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_100.wav|That every one of us put on this world has been put there for a reason and has something to offer.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_101.wav|America is a nation made up of hundreds of nationalities.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_102.wav|Our ties to you are more than ones of good feeling.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_103.wav|Their ties of kinship.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_104.wav|In America, you will find Russians, Armenians, Ukrainians, people from Eastern Europe and Central Asia.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_106.wav|Recently, a few individuals and families have been allowed to visit relatives in the West.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_107.wav|We can only hope that it won't be long before all are allowed to do so.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_109.wav|Freedom, it has been said, makes people selfish and materialistic.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_110.wav|But Americans are one of the most religious peoples on earth because they know that liberty, just as life itself, is not earned.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_111.wav|But a gift from God.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_112.wav|They seek to share that gift with the world.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_114.wav|And it is substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary spring of popular government.|1|77

wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_119.wav|The great culture of your diverse land speaks with a glowing passion to all humanity.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_120.wav|Let me cite one of the most eloquent contemporary passages on human freedom.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_121.wav|It comes not from the literature of America, but from this country, from one of the greatest writers of the 20th century.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_122.wav|Boris Pastorne in the novel Dr. Zhivago.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_123.wav|He writes,|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_125.wav|But this is just the point.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_127.wav|Today the world looks expectantly to signs of change, steps toward greater freedom in the Soviet Union.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_128.wav|We watch as, and we hope as we see positive changes taking place.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_129.wav|There are some I know in your society who fear that change will bring only disruption and discontinuity, who fear to embrace the hope of the future.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_130.wav|Sometimes it takes faith.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_131.wav|It's like that scene in the cowboy movie, Butch Cassidy in the Sundance Kid, which some here in Moscow recently had a chance to see.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_133.wav|Butch turns to Sundance and says their only hope is to jump into the river below.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_134.wav|But Sundance refuses.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_135.wav|He says he'd rather fight it out with the posse, even though they're hopelessly outnumbered.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_136.wav|Butch says that suicide and urges him to jump.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_137.wav|But Sundance still refuses and finally admits, I can't swim.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_138.wav|Butch breaks up the laughing and says you crazy fool.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_139.wav|The fall will probably kill you.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_140.wav|And by the way, both Butch and Sundance made it.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_141.wav|In case you didn't see the movie.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_142.wav|I think what I've just been talking about is Paris Stryker and what his goals are.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_145.wav|And it must take its life from the eternal things, from the source of all life which is faith.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_147.wav|That is the future beckoning to your generation.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_148.wav|At the same time, we should remember that reform, that is not institutionalized, will always be insecure.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_149.wav|Such freedom will always be looking over its shoulder, a bird on a tether, no matter how long the rope can always be pulled back.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_151.wav|And we have been talking together about one sad reminder of a divided world, the Berlin Wall.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_152.wav|It is time to remove the barriers that keep people apart.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_153.wav|I am proposing an increased exchange program of high school students between our countries.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_154.wav|General Secretary Gorbachev mentioned on Sunday a wonderful phrase you have in Russian for this.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_155.wav|Better to see something once than to hear about it a hundred times.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_156.wav|Mr. Gorbachev and I first began working on this in 1985.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_157.wav|In our discussion today, we agreed on working up to several thousand exchanges a year from each country in the near future.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_158.wav|But not everyone can travel across the continents and oceans.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_159.wav|Words travel lighter.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_160.wav|And that is why we would like to make available to this country more of our 11,000 magazines and periodicals.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_161.wav|And our television and radio shows that can be beamed off a satellite in seconds.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_162.wav|Nothing would please us more than for the Soviet people to get to know us better and to understand our way of life.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_163.wav|Just a few years ago, few would have imagined the progress our two nations have made together.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_167.wav|And that that suffering country may find self-determination, unity and peace at long last.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_172.wav|Peace between nations must be an enduring goal, not a tactical stage in a continuing conflict.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_174.wav|In answer, it says, go ask that silence lingering in the air above the birch and popular there.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_175.wav|Beneath those trees, the soldiers lie.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_176.wav|Go ask my mother, ask my wife, then you will have to ask no more, do the Russians want a war?|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_177.wav|But what if you're one time allies?|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_178.wav|What if those embraced you on the elder?|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_179.wav|What if we'd asked the watery graves of the Pacific or the European battlefields where America's fallen were buried far from home?|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_180.wav|What if we would ask their mothers, sisters and sons, do Americans want war?|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_181.wav|Ask us too, and you'll find the same answer, the same longing in every heart.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_183.wav|A people free to choose will always choose peace.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_184.wav|Americans seek always to make friends of old antagonists.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_185.wav|After a colonial revolution with Britain, we have cemented for all ages the ties of kinship between our nations.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_186.wav|After a terrible civil war between North and South, we healed our wounds and found true unity as a nation.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_187.wav|We fought two world wars in my lifetime against Germany and one with Japan.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_188.wav|But now the Federal Republic of Germany and Japan are two of our closest allies and friends.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_196.wav|Goggle asks what will be its destination.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_197.wav|But he writes there was no answer save the bell pouring forth marble of sound.|1|77
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_003.wav|Already, we have a new recovery that has been going on for about 21 months to the point that we can now call an expansion.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_005.wav|Our tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_006.wav|We have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_007.wav|The interest rates have come down about nine or ten points and we think must come down further.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_008.wav|In the last 21 months, more than six million people have gotten jobs.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_011.wav|And at the same time as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the government gets without raising taxes.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_012.wav|Those two lines will meet and when they meet, that is a balanced budget.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_013.wav|The deficit is a result.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_014.wav|It is the result of excessive government spending.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_016.wav|But it has taken place.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_017.wav|But as I said, we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_018.wav|If the rate of increase in government spending can be held at 5 percent, we're not far from there.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_019.wav|By 1989, that would have reduced the budget deficits down to a 30 or 40 billion dollar level.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_020.wav|At the same time, if we can have a 4 percent recovery continue through that same period of time, that will mean without an increase in tax rates.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_021.wav|That will mean $400 billion more in government revenues.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_022.wav|And so I think that the lines can meet actually in constant dollars in the domestic side of the budget.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_023.wav|There has been no spending increase in the four years that we have been here.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_024.wav|I don't believe that Mr. Mondale has a plan for balancing the budget.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_025.wav|He has a plan for raising taxes.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_026.wav|As a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history took place in 1977.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_027.wav|And for the five years previous to our taking office, taxes doubled in the United States and the budgets increase $318 billion.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_028.wav|So there is no ratio between taxing and balancing a budget.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_030.wav|With regard to social security, I hope there will be more time than just this minute to mention that, but I will say this.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_031.wav|A president should never say never, but I'm going to violate that rule and say never.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_032.wav|I will never stand for a reduction of the social security benefits to the people that are now getting them.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_033.wav|Whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor since you've asked it.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_035.wav|Now, leadership.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_036.wav|First of all, I think you must have some principles you believe in.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_039.wav|I don't believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding who's going to play tennis on the White House court.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_040.wav|And you let those people go with the guidelines of overall policy, not looking over their shoulder and nitpicking the manner in which they go at the job.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_041.wav|You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_042.wav|But I also believe something else about that.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_043.wav|I believe that is the right thing to do.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_044.wav|And when I became governor of California, I started this and I continued in this office.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_045.wav|That any issue that comes before me, I have instructed cabinet members and staff.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_046.wav|They are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_047.wav|I don't want to hear them.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_048.wav|I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_049.wav|Is it morally right?|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_050.wav|And on that basis and that basis alone, we make a decision on every issue.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_052.wav|Our policy was not to cut subsidies.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_054.wav|And this is what we've been trying to do is involve the federal government in such partnerships.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_055.wav|We are today subsidizing housing for more than 10 million people.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_056.wav|And we're going to continue along that line.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_057.wav|We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow whether because of age or need.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_059.wav|The safety net is there and we're taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_060.wav|Well, let me just respond with regard to social security.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_062.wav|Social security was due to go bankrupt before 1983.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_064.wav|And so we made a proposal.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_065.wav|And then in 1982, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_066.wav|And three days after the election in 1982, they came to us and said social security we know is broke.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_067.wav|Indeed, we had to borrow $17 billion to pay the checks.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_068.wav|And then I asked for a bipartisan commission which I'd asked for from the beginning to sit down and work out a solution.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_069.wav|And so the whole matter of what to do with social security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_070.wav|And it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_071.wav|Well, I was raised to have a faith and a belief and have been a member of the church since I was a small boy.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_072.wav|In our particular church, we did not use that term born again.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_073.wav|So I don't know whether I would fit that particular term.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_074.wav|But I have thanks to my mother, God rest her soul, the firmest possible belief and faith in God.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_076.wav|And I do resort to prayer.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_078.wav|As a matter of fact, I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mr. Mondale's running mate said I wasn't a good Christian.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_079.wav|So it does play a part in my life.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_080.wav|I have no hesitancy in saying so.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_082.wav|Yes, it's very difficult to rebut because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr. Mondale.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_083.wav|I too want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_085.wav|And they have been using these things to have government through court orders, inhibit the practice of religion.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_086.wav|A child wants to say grace in its school cafeteria and a court rules that they can't do it.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_087.wav|And because it's school property, these are the types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_088.wav|And I am opposed to that with regard to a platform in the Supreme Court, I can only say one thing about that.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_089.wav|I don't, I have appointed one member of the Supreme Court, Sandra Day O'Connor.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_090.wav|I'll stand in my record on that and if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, I'll do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_091.wav|Mr. Mondale, your rebuttal please.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_092.wav|Well again, I am running on the record.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_093.wav|I think sometimes Mr. Mondale's running away from his.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_094.wav|But I'm running on the record of what we have asked for.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_097.wav|And you might find those words in a democratic platform of some years ago, I know because I was a Democrat at that time.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_099.wav|I promised when we took office that we would reduce inflation, we have to one third of what it was.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_100.wav|I promised that we would reduce taxes.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_101.wav|We did 25% across the board that barely held even with, if it did that much, with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_102.wav|But at least it took that burden away from them.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_103.wav|I said that we would create jobs for our people and we did six million in the last 20 or 21 months.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_105.wav|We have done that.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_107.wav|And I think this is something the American people see.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_109.wav|We find 35 states with task forces now dealing with their educational problems.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_110.wav|We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_111.wav|All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_112.wav|So I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrats saw.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_113.wav|The leadership isn't taking this where we want to go.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_114.wav|There are tasks that government legitimately should enforce and tasks that government performs well and you've named some of them.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_116.wav|I think that we've had something to do with that just as we have with the drug problem nationwide.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_117.wav|The environment?|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_118.wav|Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_120.wav|We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands to the game refuges.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_121.wav|I think that we're out in front of most.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_124.wav|With me abortion is not a problem of religion.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_125.wav|It's a problem of the Constitution.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_127.wav|And I think that this is what we should concentrate on is trying I know there was weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_128.wav|There were medical authorities.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_129.wav|There were clerics there.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_131.wav|We have seen premature births that are now grown up happy people going around.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_132.wav|Also there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_137.wav|Well with regard to this being a personal choice isn't that what a murderer is insisting on.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_138.wav|Here's her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_139.wav|Now I'm not capable and I don't think you are any of us to make this determination that must be made with regard to human life.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_140.wav|I am simply saying that I believe that that's where the effort should be directed to make that determination.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_141.wav|I don't think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self-defense tradition.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_143.wav|That instead we make it available for the adoption there are a million and a half people out there standing in line waiting to adopt children who can't have them any other way.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_144.wav|You know I wasn't going to say this at all but I can't help it and there you go again.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_145.wav|I don't have a plan to tax or increase taxes.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_146.wav|I'm not going to increase taxes.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_147.wav|I can understand why you are Mr. Mondale because as a senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_150.wav|From 50,000 down those people paid two thirds of the taxes and those people got two thirds of the tax cut.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_151.wav|Now the social security tax of 77.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_152.wav|This indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_153.wav|It had two features.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_154.wav|It had several tax increases phased in over a period of time there are two more yet to come between now and eight and 1989.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_155.wav|At the same time every year it increased the amount of money.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_156.wav|Virtually every year there may have been one or two that were skipped in there that was subject to that tax.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_157.wav|Today it is up to about $38,000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for social security.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_159.wav|Now I don't think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich and not the other way around it just doesn't work out that way.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_161.wav|Yes I had used last resort would always be with me.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_163.wav|Then I had said once that yes you would have to then look to see if taxes should not be adjusted.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_166.wav|Well some of those facts and figures just don't stand up.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_167.wav|Yes there has been an increase in poverty but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_170.wav|We are spending now 37% more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_171.wav|We are spending a third more on all of the programs of human service.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_172.wav|We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_174.wav|We found people making 185% of the poverty level were getting government benefits.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_175.wav|We have set a line at 130% so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_176.wav|Some time ago Mr. Mondale said something about education and college students and helped with that kind.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_178.wav|We didn't think that was right and so we have set a standard that those loans and those grants are directed to the people who otherwise could not go to college.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_179.wav|Their family incomes were so low.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_181.wav|7.7 million elderly citizens who were living in the lowest 20% of earnings.|1|73
wavs/reagan_1964_001.wav|The sponsor has been identified, but unlike most television programs, the performer hasn't been provided with a script.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_002.wav|As a matter of fact, I have been permitted to choose my own words and discuss my own ideas regarding the choice that we face in the next few weeks.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_003.wav|I have spent most of my life as a Democrat.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_004.wav|I recently have seen fit to follow another course.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_005.wav|I believe that the issue is confronting us cross-party lines.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_006.wav|Now, one side in this campaign has been telling us that the issues of this election are the maintenance of peace and prosperity.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_007.wav|The line has been used.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_008.wav|We've never had it so good.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_009.wav|But I have an uncomfortable feeling that this prosperity isn't something on which we can base our hopes for the future.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_010.wav|No nation in history has ever survived a tax burden that reached a third of its national income.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_011.wav|Today, $0.37 out of every dollar earned in this country is the tax collector's share.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_012.wav|And yet our government continues to spend $17 million a day more than the government takes in.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_013.wav|We haven't balanced our budget 28 out of the last 34 years.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_014.wav|We've raised our debt limit three times in the last 12 months.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_015.wav|And now our national debt is one and a half times bigger than all the combined debts of all the nations of the world.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_016.wav|We have $15 billion in gold in our treasury.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_017.wav|We don't own an ounce.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_018.wav|$4.00 claims are $27.3 billion.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_019.wav|And we've just had an ounce that the dollar of 1939 will now purchase $0.45 in its total value.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_021.wav|That should be maintained indefinitely.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_022.wav|Do they mean peace or do they mean we just want to be left in peace?|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_023.wav|There can be no real peace while one American is dying some place in the world for the rest of us.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_024.wav|We're at war with the most dangerous enemy that has ever faced mankind in his long climb from the swamp to the stars.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_025.wav|And it's been said if we lose that war and didn't so doing lose this way of freedom of ours, history will record with the greatest astonishment to those who had the most to lose.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_026.wav|Did the least to prevent its happening.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_027.wav|Well, I think it's time we ask ourselves if we still know the freedoms that were intended for us by the founding fathers.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_028.wav|Not too long ago, two friends of mine were talking to a Cuban repugee, a businessman who would escape from Castro.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_029.wav|And in the midst of his story, one of my friends turned to the other and said, we don't know how lucky we are.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_030.wav|And the Cuban stopped and said, how lucky you are.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_031.wav|I had some place to escape to.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_032.wav|And in that sentence, he told us the entire story.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_033.wav|If we lose freedom here, there's no place to escape to.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_034.wav|This is the last stand on earth.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_036.wav|This is the issue of this election.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_038.wav|You and I are told increasingly we have to choose between a left or right.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_039.wav|Well, I'd like to suggest there is no such thing as a left or right.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_041.wav|And regardless of their sincerity, their humanitarian motives, those who would trade our freedom for security have embarked on this downward course.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_042.wav|In this boat harvesting time, they use terms like the great society.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_043.wav|Or as we were told a few days ago by the president, we must accept a greater government activity in the affairs of the people.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_044.wav|But they've been a little more explicit in the past.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_045.wav|And among themselves and all of the things I now will quote have appeared in print, these are not republican accusations.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_046.wav|For example, they have voices that say the cold war will end through our acceptance of a not undemocratic socialism.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_047.wav|Another voice says the profit motive has become outmoded.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_048.wav|It must be replaced by the incentives of the welfare state.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_049.wav|Or our traditional system of individual freedom is incapable of solving the complex problems of the 20th century.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_050.wav|Senator Fulbright has said a Stanford University that the Constitution is outmoded.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_051.wav|He referred to the president as our moral teacher and our leader.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_052.wav|And he says he is hobbled in his task by the restrictions of power imposed on him by this antiquated document.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_053.wav|He must be freed so that he can do for us what he knows is best.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_055.wav|Well, I for one resented when a representative of the people refers to you and me, the free men and women of this country as the masses.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_056.wav|This is a term we haven't applied to ourselves in America.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_057.wav|But beyond that, the full power of centralized government, this was the very thing the founding fathers sought to minimize.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_058.wav|They knew that governments don't control things.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_059.wav|A government can't control the economy without controlling people.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_060.wav|And they know when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_062.wav|Now, we have no better example of this than governments involvement in the farm economy over the last 30 years.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_063.wav|Since 1955, the cost of this program is nearly doubled.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_064.wav|One fourth of farming in America is responsible for 85% of the farm surplus.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_065.wav|Three fourths of farming is out on the free market and has known a 21% increase in the per capita consumption of all its produce.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_066.wav|You see that one fourth of farming, that's regulated and controlled by the federal government.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_067.wav|In the last three years, we've spent $43 in the feed grain program for every dollar bushel of corn we don't grow.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_068.wav|Senator Humphrey last week charged that Barry Goldwater as president would seek to eliminate farmers.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_069.wav|He should do his homework a little better because he'll find out that we've had a decline of 5 million in the farm population under these government programs.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_070.wav|He'll also find that the Democratic administration is sought to get from Congress.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_071.wav|Extension of the farm program to include that three fourths that is now free.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_072.wav|He'll find that they've also asked for the right to imprison farmers who wouldn't keep books as prescribed by the federal government.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_073.wav|The Secretary of Agriculture asked for the right to seize farms through condemnation and resell them to other individuals.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_074.wav|And contained in that same program was a provision that would have allowed the federal government to remove two million farmers from the soil.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_075.wav|At the same time, there's been an increase in the Department of Agriculture employees.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_076.wav|There's now one for every 30 farms in the United States.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_077.wav|And still, they can't tell us how 66 ship loads of grain headed for Austria disappeared without a trace.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_078.wav|But how who are farmers to know what's best for them?|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_079.wav|The fruit farmers voted against a wheat program.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_080.wav|The government passed it anyway.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_081.wav|Now the price of bread goes up the price of wheat to the farmer goes down.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_082.wav|Meanwhile, back in the city, under urban renewal, the assault on freedom carries on.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_083.wav|Private property rights so diluted that public interest is almost anything a few government planners decide it should be.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_085.wav|The president tells us he's now going to start building public housing units in the thousands where here to four we've only built them in the hundreds.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_086.wav|But FHA and the Veterans Administration tell us they have 120,000 housing units they've taken back through mortgage foreclosure.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_087.wav|For three decades, we've sought to solve the problems of unemployment through government planning and the more the plans fail, the more the planners plan.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_088.wav|The latest is the area redevelopment agency.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_089.wav|They've just declared rice county, Kansas, a depressed area.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_090.wav|We have so many people who can't see a fat man standing beside a thin one without coming to the conclusion the fat man got that way by taking advantage of the thin one.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_091.wav|So they're going to solve all the problems of human misery through government and government planning.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_093.wav|Shouldn't they be telling us about the decline each year in the number of people needing help, the reduction in the need for public housing?|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_094.wav|But the reverse is true.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_095.wav|Each year the need grows greater.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_096.wav|The program grows greater.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_097.wav|We were told four years ago that 17 million people went to bed hungry each night.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_098.wav|Well that was probably true.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_099.wav|They were all on a diet.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_100.wav|But now we're told that 9.3 million families in this country are poverty-stricken in the basis of earning less than $3,000 a year.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_101.wav|Well fair spending 10 times greater than it was in the dark depths of the depression.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_102.wav|We're spending $45 billion on welfare.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_104.wav|And remember this new program doesn't replace any.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_105.wav|It just duplicates existing programs.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_106.wav|Do they believe that poverty is suddenly going to disappear by magic?|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_107.wav|Well in all fairness I should explain there is one part of the new program that isn't duplicated.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_108.wav|This is the youth feature.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1964_109.wav|We're now going to solve the dropout problem.|1|53
wavs/reagan_1948_002.wav|I remember listening to the radio on election night in 1946.|1|37
wavs/reagan_1948_004.wav|I'm quote, remember that promise a real increase in income for everybody.|1|37
wavs/reagan_1948_005.wav|But what actually happened?|1|37
wavs/reagan_1948_006.wav|The profits of corporations have doubled while workers wages have increased by only one quarter.|1|37
wavs/reagan_1948_007.wav|In other words, profits have gone up four times as much as wages and the small increase workers did receive was more than eaten up by rising prices, which have also bored into their savings.|1|37
wavs/reagan_1948_008.wav|For example, here's an associated press dispatch I read the other day about Smith L. Carpenter, a craftsman in Union Springs, New York.|1|37
wavs/reagan_1948_009.wav|Seems that Mr. Carpenter retired some years ago, thinking he had enough money saved up so that he could live out his last years without having to worry.|1|37
wavs/reagan_1948_010.wav|But he didn't figure on this Republican inflation which ate up all his savings and so he's gone back to work.|1|37
wavs/reagan_1948_011.wav|The reason this is news is Mr. Carpenter is 91 years old.|1|37
wavs/reagan_1948_013.wav|In other words, high prices have not been caused by higher wages, but by bigger and bigger profits.|1|37
wavs/reagan_1948_014.wav|The Republican promises sounded pretty good in 1946, but what has happened since the 80th Congress took over?|1|37
wavs/reagan_1948_015.wav|Prices have climbed to the highest level in history, although the death of the OPA was supposed to bring prices down through, quote, the natural process of free competition.|1|37
wavs/reagan_1948_017.wav|Labor has been handcuffed by the vicious tap partly law.|1|37
wavs/reagan_1948_018.wav|Social security benefits have been snatched away from almost a million workers by the Gearhart bill.|1|37
wavs/reagan_1948_019.wav|Fair employment practices which had worked so well during wartime have been abandoned.|1|37
wavs/reagan_1948_020.wav|Veterans please for law cost homes have been ignored and many people are still living in made over chicken coops and garages.|1|37
wavs/reagan_1948_021.wav|Tax reduction bills have been passed to benefit the higher income brackets alone.|1|37
wavs/reagan_1948_022.wav|The average worker saved only $1.73 a week.|1|37
wavs/reagan_1948_023.wav|In the fourth name of economy millions of children have been deprived of milk once provided through the federal school lunch program.|1|37
wavs/reagan_1948_024.wav|This was the payoff of the Republicans promises and this is why we must have new faces in the Congress of the United States, Democratic faith.|1|37
wavs/reagan_1948_025.wav|This is why we must elect not only President Truman, but also men like Mayor Hubert Humphrey of Minneapolis, the Democratic candidate for Senator from Minnesota.|1|37
wavs/reagan_1948_026.wav|Mayor Humphrey of 37 is one of the ablest men in public life.|1|37
wavs/reagan_1948_027.wav|He's running against Joe Ball who is a member of the Senate Labor Committee helped write the tap partly law.|1|37
wavs/reagan_1948_028.wav|The Republicans don't want to lose ball and they're spending a small fortune on his campaign.|1|37
wavs/reagan_1948_029.wav|They've even said do we in war and out to many apples to speak for him.|1|37
wavs/reagan_1948_030.wav|President Truman knows the value of a man like you with Humphrey in the Senate and he has been in Minneapolis too, campaigning against Joe Ball.|1|37
wavs/reagan_1948_031.wav|Mayor Humphrey and Ball are the symbols of the political battle going on in America today.|1|37
wavs/reagan_1948_033.wav|I take great pride in presenting my friend from Minneapolis, Mayor Hubert H. Humphrey, candidate for United States Senator.|1|37
wavs/reagan_1974_002.wav|That's our system and that's our process and the system seems to be working.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_003.wav|Well, I don't know the facts, I have had no opportunity to discuss it with him as to what he based that on.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_005.wav|Well, once again, you're talking about something that is before the courts and the determination will be made there.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_006.wav|It's now before the grand jury.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_007.wav|Well, I think there have been evidences that they, they have said that and that there have been explanations that they, that they cannot determine themselves.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_008.wav|Uh, Rosemary Woods herself has said that this must have been accidental, that she has, uh, no understanding of the machinery and how it came about.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_009.wav|Well, Bob, I don't have access to the information upon which lawyers who either prosecutors or defense are going to make such decisions.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_013.wav|Well, we get into those definitions again, what is it conservative and what is it liberal?|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_014.wav|And some people when you say the word conservative automatically think you're talking about a monster who, uh, eats his young.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_015.wav|Well, all right, uh, the, I think the, the reverse is true.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_017.wav|I cannot recall an election where there was so little emphasis on individual personalities and so much emphasis on philosophies, two divergent philosophies.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_019.wav|And from that standpoint, I don't believe the American people have changed in that.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_020.wav|Well, I think that's good to do at determination that people are going to make.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_022.wav|Um, the people will know my age and they'll make that determination.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_024.wav|We have less than four minutes, Mr. Novak.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_025.wav|Well, Bob, I think there are some things in government that have to be weighed in priorities and whether they're done or not.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_026.wav|Yes, we all of us have been asked and not just the public.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_027.wav|I think the people in public life also are doing their best to join in the conservation movement.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_028.wav|Now, the situation of the trip to the far east, those trips are not planned in the spur of the moment.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_029.wav|There was no energy crisis.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_030.wav|Uh, I and I'm sure many other governors receive invitations, abroad for some particular purpose.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_033.wav|It's an invitation that has been repeated for three years now.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_034.wav|Finally, my timing was such that I could make this trip.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_035.wav|We notified Washington as we have in the past.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_036.wav|And Washington did have some chores.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_037.wav|And there were very important chores and some of them were in relation to energy by the time the energy crisis had come upon us.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_038.wav|We did brief the trip down.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_039.wav|We eliminated some of the lesser priority parts of the visit.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_040.wav|We made it over there and we made it back without stopovers because which is customary because of the time gap.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_041.wav|We flew back 21 hours in an airplane to get back to minimize this use of fuel.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_042.wav|But evidently, it was believed there.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_043.wav|And I have to think that there were some accomplishments in the trip that was a priority item in which weighing it, it was worthwhile.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_044.wav|I was in Indonesia.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_045.wav|I met with Saharto.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_046.wav|I met with other leaders in Indonesia and that's a country where we get 4% of our fuel supply.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_048.wav|I would go and do my keep the deal, the bargain that I had made in Australia with regard to their Red Cross.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_049.wav|But that don't just send me on something that could be described as a junket.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1974_050.wav|I wanted to know that there were really things that they considered were worth that effort.|1|63
wavs/reagan_1961_001.wav|my name is Ronald Reagan.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_002.wav|I have been asked to talk on, uh, several subjects that have to do with the problems of the day.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_003.wav|It must seem presumptuous to some of you that a member of my profession would stand here in the attempt to talk to anyone on serious problems that face the nation in the world.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_004.wav|It'll be strange if it were otherwise.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_005.wav|Most of us in Hollywood are very well aware of the concept or the misconception that many people our fellow citizens have about people in show business.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_006.wav|It was only a generation ago that people of my profession couldn't be buried in the church yard.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_007.wav|Of course the world has improved since then.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_008.wav|We can be buried now.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_009.wav|As a matter of fact, the eagerness of some of you to perform that service gets a little frightening at times.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_011.wav|But he said under the name of liberalism, the American people will adopt every fragment of the socialist program.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_012.wav|There are many ways in which our government has invaded the precincts of private citizens, the method of earning a living.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_013.wav|Our government is in business to the extent of owning more than 19,000 businesses covering 47 different lines of activity.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_014.wav|This amounts to a fifth of the total industrial capacity of the United States.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_015.wav|But at the moment, I'd like to talk about another way because this threat is with us and at the moment is more imminent.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_016.wav|One of the traditional methods of imposing stateism or socialism on a people has been by way of medicine.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_017.wav|It's very easy to disguise a medical program as a humanitarian project.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_018.wav|Most people are a little reluctant to oppose anything that suggests medical care for people who possibly can't afford it.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_019.wav|Now, the American people, if you put it to them about socialized medicine, gave them a chance to choose, would unhesitatingly vote against it.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_020.wav|We had an example of this under the Truman administration.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_021.wav|It was proposed that we have a compulsory health insurance program for all people in the United States, and of course the American people unhesitatingly rejected this.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_022.wav|So, with the American people on record as not wanting socialized medicine, Congressman Ferrand introduced the Ferrand Bill.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_023.wav|This was the idea that all people of Social Security age should be brought under a program of compulsory health insurance.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_024.wav|Now, this would not only be our senior citizens, this would be the dependents and those who are disabled.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_025.wav|This would be young people if they are dependents of someone eligible for Social Security.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_026.wav|Now, Congressman Ferrand brought the program out on that idea of just for that particular group of people.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_028.wav|Walter Ruther said, it's no secret that the United automobile workers is officially on record as backing a program of national health insurance.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_029.wav|And by national health insurance, he meant socialized medicine for every American.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_030.wav|Well, let's see what the Socialists themselves had to say about it.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_032.wav|Well, we can't say we haven't been warned.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_033.wav|Now, Congressman Ferrand is no longer a Congressman of the United States government.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_034.wav|He has been replaced, not in his particular assignment, but in his backing of such a bill by Congressman King of California.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_035.wav|It is presented in the idea of a great emergency that millions of our senior citizens are unable to provide needed medical care.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_037.wav|Now, the advocates of this bill, when you try to oppose it, challenge you on an emotional basis.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_038.wav|They say, what would you do?|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_039.wav|Throw these poor old people out to die with no medical attention?|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_040.wav|That's ridiculous, and of course no one is advocated.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_041.wav|As a matter of fact, in the last session of Congress, a bill was adopted known as the Kerr Mills Bill.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_042.wav|Now, without even allowing this bill to be tried to see if it works, they have introduced this King Bill, which is really the Ferrand Bill.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_043.wav|What is the Kerr Mills Bill?|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_044.wav|It is a frank recognition of the medical need or problem of a senior citizens that I have mentioned.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_045.wav|And it is provided from the federal government money to the states and the local communities that can be used at the discretion of the state to help those people who needed.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_049.wav|They want to attach this bill to social security, and they say here is a great insurance program now instituted now working.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_050.wav|Let's take a look at social security itself.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_052.wav|And to this end, social security was adopted, but it was never intended to supplant private savings, private insurance, pension programs of unions and industries.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_053.wav|Now in our country, under our free enterprise system, we have seen medicine reach the greatest heights that it has in any country in the world.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_054.wav|Today, the relationship between patient and doctor in this country is something to be envied any place.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_055.wav|The privacy, the care that is given to a person, the right to choose a doctor, the right to go from one doctor to the other.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_056.wav|But let's also look from the other side at the freedom the doctor loses.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_057.wav|A doctor would be reluctant to say this, well, like you, I'm only a patient, so I can say it in his behalf.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_058.wav|The doctor begins to lose freedoms.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_059.wav|It's like telling a lie and one leads to another.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_060.wav|First, you decide that the doctor can have so many patients, they're equally divided among the various doctors by the government.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_061.wav|But then the doctors aren't equally divided geographically.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_062.wav|So a doctor decides he wants to practice in one town, and the government has to say to him, you can't live in that town.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_063.wav|They already have enough doctors, you have to go someplace else.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_064.wav|And from here, it's only a short step to dictating where he will go.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_065.wav|This is a freedom that I wonder whether any of us have the right to take from any human being.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_066.wav|I know how I'd feel, if you, my fellow citizens, decided that to be an actor, I had to become a government employee and work in a national theater.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_067.wav|Take it into your own occupation or that of your husband.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_069.wav|From here, it's a short step to all the rest of socialism to determining his pay.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_070.wav|And pretty soon, your son won't decide when he's in school where he will go or what he will do for a living.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_071.wav|In this country of ours took place the greatest revolution that has ever taken place in world's history, the only true revolution.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_072.wav|Every other revolution simply exchanged one set of rulers for another.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_073.wav|But here for the first time in all the thousands of years of man's relation to man, a little group of men, the founding fathers, for the first time.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_074.wav|Establish the idea that you and I had within ourselves the God-given right and ability to determine our own destiny.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_075.wav|This freedom was built into our government with safeguards.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_076.wav|We talked democracy today, and strangely we let democracy begin to assume the aspect of majority rule is all that is needed.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_078.wav|What can we do about this?|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_079.wav|Well, you and I can do a great deal.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_080.wav|We can write to our congressmen, to our senators.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_081.wav|We can say right now that we want no further encroachment on these individual liberties and freedoms.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_082.wav|And at the moment, the key issue is we do not want socialized medicine.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_083.wav|Now you may think when I say right to the congressmen of the senator that this is like writing fan mail to a television program, it isn't.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_084.wav|In Washington today, 40,000 letters less than 100 per congressmen are evidence of a trend in public thinking.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_086.wav|So right, it's as simple as finding just the name of your congressman or your senator.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_088.wav|And if this man writes back to you and tells you that he too is for free enterprise, but we have these great services and so forth that must be performed by government, don't let him get away with it.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_090.wav|Governments will always find a need for the money they get and that you demand the continuation of our traditional free enterprise system.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_091.wav|You and I can do this.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_093.wav|Write those letters now, call your friends and tell them to write them.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1961_095.wav|Until one day as Norman Thomas said, we will awake to find that we have socialism and if you don't do this and if I don't do it.|1|50
wavs/reagan_1954_001.wav|but evening, I am Ronald Reagan speaking for General Electric.|1|43
wavs/reagan_1954_002.wav|Tonight from Hollywood it is my pleasure to appear in a story entitled The Dark Dark Ours.|1|43
wavs/reagan_1954_004.wav|I want you to get out of this house and I want you to get out right now.|1|43
wavs/reagan_1954_005.wav|That's only a 32.|1|43
wavs/reagan_1954_006.wav|That's not a very big bullet.|1|43
wavs/reagan_1954_007.wav|You gotta be lucky.|1|43
wavs/reagan_1954_008.wav|And if you're lucky, very lucky.|1|43
wavs/reagan_1954_009.wav|And you've killed another man.|1|43
wavs/reagan_1954_010.wav|And if you're not lucky, that bullet isn't good to stop me.|1|43
wavs/reagan_1954_012.wav|I want you to take your hands off my wife and get out of this house.|1|43
wavs/reagan_1954_013.wav|Get out of the way.|1|43
wavs/reagan_1954_015.wav|I'll get out of the way.|1|43
wavs/reagan_1954_016.wav|But you're going out of here alone, sunny.|1|43
wavs/reagan_1954_017.wav|You never did get the idea, did you?|1|43
wavs/reagan_1954_018.wav|Did you think for one minute that I was afraid of you?|1|43
wavs/reagan_1954_019.wav|I did everything you asked because I wanted to get you out of here.|1|43
wavs/reagan_1954_020.wav|I didn't want my family getting hurt by a vicious little pup like you.|1|43
wavs/reagan_1954_021.wav|No, you had to be a big man with a gun.|1|43
wavs/reagan_1954_022.wav|Well, your friend in there is dead because he how big does that make you feel?|1|43
wavs/reagan_1954_023.wav|Because if I started, I don't think I could stop.|1|43
wavs/reagan_1954_024.wav|Well, I hope you enjoyed James Dean and Constance Ford.|1|43
wavs/reagan_1954_025.wav|And the rest of us in the dark, dark hours.|1|43
