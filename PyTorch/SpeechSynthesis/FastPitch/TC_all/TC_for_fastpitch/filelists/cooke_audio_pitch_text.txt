mels/cooke_1974-12-23_002.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_002.pt|What I ought to talk about is the 1974 General Assembly of the United Nations.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_003.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_003.pt|What I must tell you about is an encounter I recently had with the Russians, which is insignificant, coccyde and hilarious.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_004.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_004.pt|We leave that as the icing and get down to the cake.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_005.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_005.pt|It's been tea time talk for 10 years or more that the United Nations has been going downhill as the world organization able to keep the peace.

mels/cooke_1974-12-23_007.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_007.pt|So I think I ought to say as clearly and briefly as I can why I think it's gone down.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_008.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_008.pt|The overriding aim of the United Nations was firmness stated on the day of its birth in San Francisco 29 years ago.

mels/cooke_1974-12-23_010.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_010.pt|And the way to do that everybody present agreed was to give the United Nations a force, a physical force stronger than that of its strongest members or of any coalition of them.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_011.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_011.pt|They said it all in one article of the charter article 43.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_012.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_012.pt|It binds all the member nations to make available to the Security Council on its call and in accordance with the special agreement or agreements armed forces, assistance and facilities including rights of passage necessary for the purpose of maintaining international peace and security.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_013.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_013.pt|These agreements were to be negotiated as soon as possible.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_014.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_014.pt|Well the simple disastrous truth is that they have never been negotiated.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_015.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_015.pt|No nation feels obliged to make available to the Security Council a bow and arrow let alone the bulk of its armed forces.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_016.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_016.pt|So the United Nations has never had the force to assert the authority it claims because none of us is willing to accept an international verdict against our own national interests.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_017.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_017.pt|I believe it's as unavoidably simple as that.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_018.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_018.pt|So now to the session of the General Assembly that has just ended with such a menacing bang for the Western world.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_019.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_019.pt|To put it as forcefully and fairly as possible let's recall the annual assemblers of the 1940s and 50s and 60s.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_020.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_020.pt|For four years we had rousing meetings, much promise of much good to poor countries and many expressions of peaceful intent among the powerful.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_021.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_021.pt|But the Russians were a nuisance at best, at worst a constant threat to the independence of countries in the Middle East.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_022.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_022.pt|They kept on using their charter right to veto every Security Council resolution that called for force or international action in any place that interested them.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_023.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_023.pt|So in 1950 the Americans and the Britons got together and pushed through an assembly resolution giving the right to call for arms to the assembly where the Russians veto couldn't be used.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_024.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_024.pt|Why were the Americans and the British able to do this?
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_025.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_025.pt|Because they were absolutely top-dog at the time and they could always count on the supporting vote of an actual majority which was made up of what the Russians called our satellites and what we called all good men and true, namely Western Europe and the Latin American nations.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_026.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_026.pt|Today the UN which started with 50 member nations has 138 and the majority is made up neither of our satellites nor the Russian satellites.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_027.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_027.pt|It's sometimes known as the Third World.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_028.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_028.pt|It is in the main the poor countries of Asia and Africa.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_029.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_029.pt|In this assembly the Russians voted with them automatically just to be sure the Chinese didn't monopolize the role of the poor man's friend.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_030.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_030.pt|This year for the first time the new majority flexed its muscles because it was backed by the Arab countries whose citizens may be poor but whose leaders are rich enough to threaten our own wealth if not to annex it.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_031.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_031.pt|So the Arabs were the biceps of this muscle man show and Algeria was the brains or ideological guide.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_032.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_032.pt|Together they managed to get South Africa actually barred from the assembly.

mels/cooke_1974-12-23_036.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_036.pt|All in all it was a humbling session for the white man for Western Europe for the United States and for the Latin Americans for all the old reliable Western majority.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_037.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_037.pt|The majority has swung to the black men and the brown men and the yellow men and it looks as if the future of the UN were theirs to dictate.

mels/cooke_1974-12-23_040.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_040.pt|The invitation came from an unlikely host, a friend of mine, who is a lawyer, an affable gent, a republican and a first-rate golfer.

mels/cooke_1974-12-23_042.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_042.pt|Golf he said was to be the main reason for the lunch.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_043.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_043.pt|Now this was like being invited by a rabbi to lunch with the Pope to discuss stud poker I accepted instantly.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_044.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_044.pt|The co-host was a young American, a boyish type out of Disney who is associated with his famous father in the most successful golf architect's firm on earth.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_045.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_045.pt|Golf architecture is the art of designing and building golf courses and involves much knowledge of landscape, grasses, water drainage, engineering, meteorology and sometimes I feel black magic.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_046.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_046.pt|Let's call the young man Mr. Jones for that is his name.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_047.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_047.pt|He had recently returned from Moscow where he and his father had responded to what must have first sounded like an incredible call from the mayor of Moscow to build the first Russian golf course.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_048.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_048.pt|The impulse apparently had come from a Soviet diplomat who had been exposed to the west and become one mad golfer, the only Russian golfer of whom we have any knowledge and curiously he was not bundled off to Siberia to play golf with a little red ball and a snow sledge.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_049.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_049.pt|Somehow he sold the mayor of Moscow on the idea.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_050.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_050.pt|I don't imagine things are allowed to rest there the matter went up to the Kremlin and from all I could gather Mr. Brezhnev gave the nod.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_051.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_051.pt|Well the consul general turned out to be a rumply, rye-faced man with a puckish humor.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_052.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_052.pt|When we asked him if the Russians would take the golf he said, you see the Russian people like quick games and somebody said like chess he came back on the hop we like a quick win.

mels/cooke_1974-12-23_055.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_055.pt|After that the consul general had to have a lesson in weaponry golf Winston Churchill said is a game whose aim is to hit a very small ball into an even smaller hole with weapons singularly ill designed for the purpose.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_056.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_056.pt|We went off in electric carts like a little motorized battalion to the eleventh tee on this noble San Francisco golf club course a swaying rolling landscape of brilliant green meadows and hills towering with cypress and pine and eucalyptus.

mels/cooke_1974-12-23_063.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_063.pt|Now the consul general was motion to play.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_064.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_064.pt|He too took off his coat and looked down at the ball seized the club with the baseball grip his two hands far apart.

mels/cooke_1974-12-23_072.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_072.pt|He looked over his shoulder to see if there was a CIA man behind a tree.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_073.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_073.pt|Because he said don't you see it reinforces the main argument and what would that be.
mels/cooke_1974-12-23_074.pt|pitch/cooke_1974-12-23_074.pt|I realized then that the argument had come up in Moscow and that we'd kicked it around at lunch.

mels/cooke_1973-08-25_029.pt|pitch/cooke_1973-08-25_029.pt|Most people called it disappointing and there was a widespread feeling of skepticism verging on sarcasm about two points.

mels/cooke_1973-08-25_031.pt|pitch/cooke_1973-08-25_031.pt|The reason was and Mr. Nixon was very earnest and measured about it that there are certain precious relationships whose confidence should never be broken.

mels/cooke_1973-08-25_035.pt|pitch/cooke_1973-08-25_035.pt|For what everybody had in mind was the president's approval of having his secret White House investigating team known as the plumbers.

mels/cooke_1973-08-25_037.pt|pitch/cooke_1973-08-25_037.pt|The second point was an even more glaring example of the president's seeming at any rate to be delivering a sincere sermon against the very thing he practiced.
mels/cooke_1973-08-25_038.pt|pitch/cooke_1973-08-25_038.pt|I mean the secret bugging or taping of every conversation that took place in the three main rooms at the White House.
mels/cooke_1973-08-25_039.pt|pitch/cooke_1973-08-25_039.pt|It seemed odd for the president to be teaching us so gravely about the sacredness of confidential conversations when he was always the only person present who knew they were being recorded.
mels/cooke_1973-08-25_040.pt|pitch/cooke_1973-08-25_040.pt|Five minutes after the speech was over I was in a cabin riding uptown and the driver said in a few choice words what apparently a majority of Americans felt then or since.
mels/cooke_1973-08-25_041.pt|pitch/cooke_1973-08-25_041.pt|The driver said who did he think he was talking to?

mels/cooke_1973-08-25_044.pt|pitch/cooke_1973-08-25_044.pt|Now the president I think it's well established and told his advisors that his television address was to be the final speech on Watergate the clincher that would convince the people drop Watergate overboard and leave him unburdened to sail the ship of state.
mels/cooke_1973-08-25_045.pt|pitch/cooke_1973-08-25_045.pt|Well plainly the speech didn't do it Watergate will not sink it bobs around that ship of state like a floating mine that in a rough sea is maddeningly and always out of reach.
mels/cooke_1973-08-25_046.pt|pitch/cooke_1973-08-25_046.pt|So last Wednesday the president tried again he held his first press conference in five months and though it's a sensible purpose was to announce that Dr Henry Kissinger is to succeed Mr. Rogers.
mels/cooke_1973-08-25_047.pt|pitch/cooke_1973-08-25_047.pt|As Secretary of State with the consent of the Senate the questions flowed on about Watergate and the president talked with an openness that might have done him much good three or four months ago.
mels/cooke_1973-08-25_048.pt|pitch/cooke_1973-08-25_048.pt|He said he had delegated responsibility for investigating Watergate to one of the directors of his campaign committee who turned out to be a key conspirator in it.
mels/cooke_1973-08-25_049.pt|pitch/cooke_1973-08-25_049.pt|Also to one man in the White House who delegated responsibility to another the White House legal counsel the president never took it up with his closest pal and advisor John Mitchell.

mels/cooke_1973-08-25_052.pt|pitch/cooke_1973-08-25_052.pt|The president did not say again what must have been an audio to admit to a national audience that he the president of the United States had all the resources of the FBI and the CIA and his closest White House advisors and pals all working on it and yet everything he was told for nine months was wrong.
mels/cooke_1973-08-25_053.pt|pitch/cooke_1973-08-25_053.pt|Now this is what sticks in the people's crawl and apparently I do believe the president is one of the few people who doesn't see it.
mels/cooke_1973-08-25_054.pt|pitch/cooke_1973-08-25_054.pt|I found the televising of his press conference fascinating because I felt that he really did look older, gentler almost humbled by the merciless pressure he's been under and I mean the pressure of the unanswered facts that will not go away.
mels/cooke_1973-08-25_055.pt|pitch/cooke_1973-08-25_055.pt|The papers and the television soothsayers tell us that the president is a changed man.

mels/cooke_1973-08-25_060.pt|pitch/cooke_1973-08-25_060.pt|He could now bring up the one's taboo word of resignation.
mels/cooke_1973-08-25_061.pt|pitch/cooke_1973-08-25_061.pt|Now he would not resign he'd been elected to do a job and for the next three and a half years he was going to do it which is to make this world safer for this generation and the next and make life better.
mels/cooke_1973-08-25_062.pt|pitch/cooke_1973-08-25_062.pt|For the people at home and their children after them he deeply deplored Watergate but now it was behind us it was all over.
mels/cooke_1973-08-25_063.pt|pitch/cooke_1973-08-25_063.pt|Now this was the moment he gave that hesitant chuckle which to his admirers signifies a spasm of genuine modesty and to his haters a hint of your eye heap.
mels/cooke_1973-08-25_064.pt|pitch/cooke_1973-08-25_064.pt|We've had he said 30 minutes of this press conference I have yet to have one example one question on the business of the people he didn't say it defiantly with his jaw out and the invisible flag waving as he often does.
mels/cooke_1973-08-25_065.pt|pitch/cooke_1973-08-25_065.pt|He had once said quietly wasn't criticizing the press he just found it curious that they went on and on about Watergate and in that moment he was almost trembling red-eyed truly at bay.

mels/cooke_2002-11-08_003.pt|pitch/cooke_2002-11-08_003.pt|I guessed his character from the style and tone of the letter, and the county address that sounded like a woodhouse invention, say dripping lodge, pitchville, upper draining on the marsh, and the picture that came to mind was one of my favorite characters in the whole of fiction, the incomparable galahad Thripwood, first described as a dapper man in his fifties in a small checked coat, tight trousers, and a gray bowler hat with racing glasses bumping against his left hip, his bright eyes watching them rounding into the straight, his neatly-shod foot seeming to pour in search of a brass rail.

mels/cooke_1992-02-28_001.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_001.pt|good morning about a month ago, a reporter was arrested and sent off to prison.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_002.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_002.pt|His sin was that in writing about some flaw or injustice or fiddle in the government, he'd used a confidential source and when the authorities asked him to reveal the source, he refused.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_003.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_003.pt|So he was bustled off.

mels/cooke_1992-02-28_019.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_019.pt|Both of them on a day early in October of last year had reported something which the public until then knew nothing about.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_020.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_020.pt|Namely, that one Anita Hill, the professor of law at the University of Oklahoma, had made a very serious accusation against Judge Clarence Thomas, a judge of the appeals court who was at that moment coming to the end of hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee on his fitness to fulfill the president's appointment of him to the Supreme Court.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_021.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_021.pt|She had accused him, these two reporters said or wrote, of being constantly asked to go out with him when she worked for him at the Education Department, of the Government Commission, that she as constantly refused, and that he recounted details of pornographic films he'd seen, and in other ways sexually harassed her.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_022.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_022.pt|The special council appointed by the Senate Rules Committee now wants to know simply where the two reporters got their information, their source.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_023.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_023.pt|They both politely refused to tell him, and spent the rest of the hours responding to intermordable questions as the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution allows them to do, I respectfully refuse to answer on the grounds of self-incrimination.

mels/cooke_1992-02-28_025.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_025.pt|In fact, they were just about over, but the revelation or assertion of those two reporters caused the chairman of the committee to call for a second round to have the judge confront in another public hearing his accuser.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_026.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_026.pt|And I don't need to say that for several days the thing was gone into to the vast and ugly titillation of millions of television viewers in more countries than this one.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_027.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_027.pt|Now, two questions.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_028.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_028.pt|First, if the two reporters were indeed the beneficiaries of a leak, who is the leak, the deep throat, and who wanted to have the leak traced to the point of inviting two reporters to refuse under oath to tell, and so put themselves in contempt of Congress.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_029.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_029.pt|Well, the history of how Miss Hill came in the end to be called before the Judiciary Committee is long and torturous, but in spite of the furious conviction on the part of some republic and senators on the committee that one or other of the Democrat members had enticed Miss Hill into going public, there is a straight line, a sequence of events that is not in question and not hard to follow, though the identity of some of the participants is unknown or in dispute.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_030.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_030.pt|First, then, during the summer of 1991, when the personal staffs of the senators on the committee were preparing for the hearings, a journalist who had written profiles and other pieces on judge Thomas was approached by some Senate staffer, nevermind who, nothing about Anita Hill surfaced in his testimony.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_031.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_031.pt|In August, the lady who belonged to a citizen's group known as the Alliance for Justice got a call from a man, she knew, who had been a classmate of Miss Hill at Yale Law School.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_032.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_032.pt|He told the lady that Miss Hill had been sexually harassed by Miss Determus way back.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_033.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_033.pt|The lady passed on this charge to the staff of one of the Democrat senators on the committee.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_034.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_034.pt|Soon, inevitably the chairman of the committee, Senator Biden, another Democrat, got wind of this and ordered another committee staffer to talk to Miss Hill and have her confirm or deny the charge.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_035.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_035.pt|She thought things over and eventually made a sworn statement to a committee staffer.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_036.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_036.pt|We really could stop there because it was that statement that the Long Island reporter and the National Public Radio Woman Reporter got a hold of.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_037.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_037.pt|How and from whom is what the Senate's special counsel wants to know?
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_038.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_038.pt|But I ought to finish off the story because it has been wrongly claimed that what was leaked was Miss Hill's private testimony to the FBI.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_039.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_039.pt|Senator Biden, the chairman of the committee, sent Miss Hill's sworn statement to President Bush in the legitimate belief that this matter was serious enough to be looked into by the FBI.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_040.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_040.pt|The FBI is the investigating arm of the Department of Justice, which of course is under the President's wing of the government, the executive.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_041.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_041.pt|The President or his Attorney General alone can order the FBI to make an investigation, which President Bush did.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_042.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_042.pt|Miss Hill agreed then to be interviewed by the FBI and there she made again her charge of sexual harassment.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_043.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_043.pt|Pretty much in the form she was later to recite before the committee in the presence of Judge Thomas.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_044.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_044.pt|Anyway, it was Miss Hill's sworn statement before a committee staffer that was leaked by somebody to the two subpoenaed reporters.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_045.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_045.pt|You'll see that there were many pipelines of rumor and tattling that could have provided a leak.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_046.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_046.pt|Second question.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_047.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_047.pt|Who insisted on this new investigation, whose only aim is to discover the identity of the leaker?
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_048.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_048.pt|The answer is two or three Republican senators, strong supporters of Judge Thomas on the Judiciary Committee, who will live in that Miss Hill's charges ever came to public knowledge and who claimed then and now that Miss Hill was from the beginning a patsy, a setup, a dupe of somebody, probably a staff member of one of the Democrat senators who had gone out early in the summer on a muck-raking expedition to find something damning to Judge Thomas's nomination.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_049.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_049.pt|And by a seduous raking, probably they hinted among feminists, liberals and other such mischief makers, had brought up in the sieve this nasty bit of rumor, Oslander or whatever.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_050.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_050.pt|Because the two reporters, Mr. Phelps and Mr. Tottenberg were the first people to bring it out in public.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_051.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_051.pt|They were brought before the Special Counsel of the Senate Rules Committee, which these Republicans had insisted should be called to investigate.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_052.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_052.pt|Now, as I said, the Senate has the power to cite refusing testifiers for contempt of Congress and therefore, Mr. Tottenberg and Mr. Phelps could, once the citation is issued, be sent to jail.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_053.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_053.pt|It's extremely unlikely that the Senate dare do that.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_054.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_054.pt|In the past 25 years, there have been other cases of journalists refusing to name the leaks who provided, for instance, secret documents from the Pentagon, from the Justice Department, some even protected by government security.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_055.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_055.pt|But the courts have steadily maintained that the First Amendment, Freedom of the Press, protects the free flow of information and a reporter's right not to disclose confidential sources.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_056.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_056.pt|In this case, Ms. Hill's sworn statement is not by any definition a secret government document, and no crime of any sort is imputed.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_057.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_057.pt|If Mr. Phelps and Mr. Tottenberg did get sent to jail, there'd be such a huge national outcry as to turn the gallant or defiant victims into a couple of martyrs.
mels/cooke_1992-02-28_058.pt|pitch/cooke_1992-02-28_058.pt|The vengeful Republicans who started the investigation surely know this and must now be stumped on how to act like stern headmasters and yet do nothing but slap two wrists.

Nixon himself had concurred in the notion of Mr. Cox's absolute independence by the way I'm still fishing for the document the letter or the speech in which mr. Nixon laid this guarantee on the line well anyway at the time there's no doubt Mr. Nixon was extremely eager to prove that the White House was not covering up the Watergate mess or covering up the earlier cover up he wanted to show that he had nothing to hide and undoubtedly one way or another he assured mr. Richardson that special prosecutor Cox was a man on his own free to delve and dive into any evidence he came up with on this understanding the Senate confirmed mr. Richardson as the Attorney General and mr. Cox went to work with his 80 assistants

mels/cooke_1973-10-26_032.pt|pitch/cooke_1973-10-26_032.pt|the Senate select committee that was set up to probe into Watergate came to the conclusion that the great question which harried the country for many months was the president implicated and if so how much could best be answered by listening to the tape recordings of nine conversations held in the White House several of them between the president and mr. John Dean the former White House aide the man who more than any other had accused the president of knowing about Watergate and helping to cover it up a federal court decided that it had no power to release the tapes to the Congressional Committee but the same judge did order president Nixon to release the tapes to the court which would pass on what it took to be relevant to mr. Cox and his team the issue is now and only one remove from the judgment of the Supreme Court the president could turn over the tapes or he could refuse and bow as he promised to bow to the final ruling of the Supreme Court at this point the president did neither he proposed to compromise whereby the tapes would be heard in private by a certain senator senator John Stennis a southern Democrat a friend of mr. Nixon but a man allowed by all parties to be of unimpeachable honesty he would decide what concerned Watergate and would let mr. Cox see the full transcript he would also decide what concerned national security and he would pass on a written summary of that without the text the senate Watergate Committee was willing after several backings and fillings to go along with this but special prosecutor Cox was not nor was judge Sirica the chief judge of the United States District Court in Washington who ordered mr. Nixon to turn over the tapes to him through all the seething speculation and legal arguments and newspaper comment the White House made its defiance of the courts very clear indeed when illegal aid to the White House crisply summed up the president's position which was that the president cannot be convicted of a crime and cannot even be indicted so long as he's in office and has not been impeached by the House and then removed from office by a two-thirds vote against him in his subsequent trial by the senate that was the moment when impeachment became not a threat but a practical possibility when the congress came back from holiday a week ago many impeachment resolutions were offered in the House and the senate judiciary committee has started looking into the justification if any for starting the formalities of impeachment suddenly the president changed his mind and the country stirred under a huge sigh of relief he will let judge Sirica hear the tapes in full for a day or two it did look as if we had a president who like some general of a revolutionary hunter was going to declare as the Supreme Court of Chile declared last week that henceforth the law would be what the general said it was but the press exploded and so did the American Bar associations the congress had had enough and most important of all judge Sirica did not quail he was ready to cite the president for contempt and the president came in there are from all indications many more black storms ahead for Richard M Nixon but after this first one a senator Irving likes to say the country is not in ruins the constitution is in effect and the republic still stands

mels/cooke_1991-10-11_037.pt|pitch/cooke_1991-10-11_037.pt|So of course, the moment we heard Miss Hill's charge, the irony bloomed that the government's agent to police and punish discrimination of any kind should have been charged with of all things, sexual harassment.

mels/cooke_1991-10-11_040.pt|pitch/cooke_1991-10-11_040.pt|We're at the point where Miss Hill is being questioned by one of Senator Kennedy's staff, and she replies, apropos of the rumors he heard about sexual harassment when she worked for Mr. Thomas.

mels/cooke_1991-10-11_046.pt|pitch/cooke_1991-10-11_046.pt|That was all in the original complaint.
mels/cooke_1991-10-11_047.pt|pitch/cooke_1991-10-11_047.pt|Miss Hill stressed that there'd been no attempt at physical contact, not even touching.
mels/cooke_1991-10-11_048.pt|pitch/cooke_1991-10-11_048.pt|She also stressed that she'd not come forward on her own, but been called by the committee.
mels/cooke_1991-10-11_049.pt|pitch/cooke_1991-10-11_049.pt|Miss Hill's statement was circulated among the members of the Judiciary Committee, and the chairman, Senator Biden, who of course is a Democrat, and the senior Republican Senator Thurmond agreed to have the FBI do a private investigation.
mels/cooke_1991-10-11_050.pt|pitch/cooke_1991-10-11_050.pt|I say, of course, Senator Biden is a Democrat, to remind you that the Democrats are the majority party in the Senate as in the House, and therefore all committee chairman are Democrats.
mels/cooke_1991-10-11_051.pt|pitch/cooke_1991-10-11_051.pt|Anyway, the FBI completed its report, which involved naturally talking to Judge Thomas and Miss Hill separately, and to any other people who might be relevant witnesses.
mels/cooke_1991-10-11_052.pt|pitch/cooke_1991-10-11_052.pt|By the way, when Miss Hill made her affidavit, she asked that the whole matter be kept confidential, that her name be kept secret that Judge Thomas should not be told.
mels/cooke_1991-10-11_053.pt|pitch/cooke_1991-10-11_053.pt|Well, pretty soon several senators reminded her, the law professor remember, that under the law an accused person has the right to know the accusation and the name of the accuser.
mels/cooke_1991-10-11_054.pt|pitch/cooke_1991-10-11_054.pt|So that's how the whole thing eventually got out.
mels/cooke_1991-10-11_055.pt|pitch/cooke_1991-10-11_055.pt|The Judiciary Committee had spent over two weeks publicly hearing legal and other relevant testimony about Judge Thomas, and also in private wondering what to do with Miss Hill's affidavit in the FBI's report.
mels/cooke_1991-10-11_056.pt|pitch/cooke_1991-10-11_056.pt|Fatally, they decided to keep an underlock in key, and the vote on Judge Thomas went forward, seven, four, seven against.
mels/cooke_1991-10-11_057.pt|pitch/cooke_1991-10-11_057.pt|Then the vote went on to the whole Senate, which, as I say, was to vote in all innocents so far as the sexual charge was concerned, last year's the evening.

mels/cooke_1991-10-11_064.pt|pitch/cooke_1991-10-11_064.pt|The Senate vote for and against Judge Thomas was now a wash in uncertainty, so the Senate agreed to put it off for a week till next Tuesday.

mels/cooke_1973-01-27_015.pt|pitch/cooke_1973-01-27_015.pt|If this was the reason for it no wonder Mr. Nixon gave no explanation to the Congress or the people beyond the doggy assurance of the Pentagon press officer that the bombing was restricted to military targets.

mels/cooke_1970-08-08_031.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_031.pt|These two refugees wondered if the American state department had any notion what the coincidence of these two items could signify.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_032.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_032.pt|They were both highly intelligent men, obviously passionately anti-Nazi, and they set up nights in their modest digs in New York and wondered how to make their information known.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_033.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_033.pt|If they had gone in person to the state department or the White House, they would quite likely have been waived away or locked up as nuts.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_034.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_034.pt|Let us call them Mr. W and Mr. S.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_035.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_035.pt|Mr.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_036.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_036.pt|S suddenly remembered the old man, another refugee, but better known he might carry a little weight.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_037.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_037.pt|That was it, get to the old man, tell him what was meant by the equation one secret meeting plus one export man.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_038.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_038.pt|But where was the old man?
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_039.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_039.pt|Well, one of them had heard that he was down at the end of Long Island, summering in a cottage rented from a local doctor.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_040.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_040.pt|Dr. Wait a minute, more, that was it, but now the place.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_041.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_041.pt|Mr.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_042.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_042.pt|W who remembered all this couldn't recall the name of the nearest village.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_043.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_043.pt|Now Long Island is 120 miles long and full of place names.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_044.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_044.pt|And the English names might be forgettable enough to a couple of Hungarians, but how about the Indian names, Acrobat, Noyac and Matituk and Rung Conkama and Apacquog and the like.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_045.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_045.pt|It was spelled, said Mr. W with a P.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_046.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_046.pt|They saw a name, 90 miles down the island on the map in red letters, Pachock.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_047.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_047.pt|That's it, that's the one.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_048.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_048.pt|So they drove off.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_049.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_049.pt|And they got out and they asked in stores and petrol stations, anybody know the whereabouts of Dr. Morris Cottage?
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_050.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_050.pt|Nobody'd ever heard of him.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_051.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_051.pt|They got into the car again and sweated over the map.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_052.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_052.pt|Could it be, said Mr. S, looking up to the bay to the north of them?
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_053.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_053.pt|Pecanic.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_054.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_054.pt|That's it, cried the other now I remember.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_055.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_055.pt|So they drove north and east along the north fork and came to the minute town of Pecanic, which to this day is one small saloon, one shop and a battered railroad station.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_056.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_056.pt|Dr. Moore, please.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_057.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_057.pt|Dr. Moore was unheard of.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_058.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_058.pt|It was one of those hideous days of a grey, leaden sky and the heat up in the 90s.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_059.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_059.pt|And the map was like a towel in their hands.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_060.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_060.pt|They were irritable and in despair and they turned to drive the hundred miles back to the city.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_061.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_061.pt|But less than two miles from Pecanic on the old two-lane highway you have to go through another one street town called Kachag.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_062.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_062.pt|They stopped at the drugstore to get some trifle they don't remember now, what?
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_063.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_063.pt|And one last try, they mentioned again the name of Dr. Moore.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_064.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_064.pt|Nothing.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_065.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_065.pt|Well, how about simply asking where the old man lived?
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_066.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_066.pt|They saw a boy about seven years of age standing on a corner with a fishing rod in his hand.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_067.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_067.pt|The old man was a great fisherman.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_068.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_068.pt|Sure said the little boy, he lives in Dr. Moore's cottage and he climbed in and he led them there.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_069.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_069.pt|The old man came out in his slippers and they told him their news and they had a hot hour explaining to him what it all meant or could mean.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_070.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_070.pt|They thought at first it would be better to write to the Belgian government who had the only other source of this particular ore and then send a copy to the State Department.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_071.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_071.pt|So they drove back to New York and there they had more misgivings.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_072.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_072.pt|The letter might vanish in the yawning files of the State Department.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_073.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_073.pt|They began to tremble at the awful possibilities of a long delay.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_074.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_074.pt|Maybe they should get the old man to write even to the president of the United States.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_075.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_075.pt|Now these young Hungarians were tense types but they were scientists.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_076.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_076.pt|They were not by any means used to this peri-mason sort of caper.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_077.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_077.pt|They made discrete inquiries of other friends, other obscure refugees and a German newer banker who was a personal friend of Rosefelt.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_078.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_078.pt|Maybe he could be the courier.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_079.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_079.pt|So they sat down and they drafted a bold and simple letter.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_080.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_080.pt|The great thing would be to get the old man to sign it.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_081.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_081.pt|And so on the 2nd of August they drove off again.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_082.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_082.pt|Not the same couple.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_083.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_083.pt|Mr. W had to go to California and Mr. S couldn't drive.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_084.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_084.pt|So he invited another Budapest refugee, Mr. T.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_085.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_085.pt|They drove the 100 miles with no fears this time of losing their way.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_086.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_086.pt|Not Pachog with a P, not Piconic with a P but Kachog with an Og and easy mistake to make our visiting friends do it all the time.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_087.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_087.pt|The old man was in his slippers again and they went inside into his small living room and they read a German draft and an English one.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_088.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_088.pt|And at last the old man nodded.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_089.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_089.pt|And he put his pen to it.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_090.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_090.pt|Next step onto the banker on the White House.
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_091.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_091.pt|It read,
mels/cooke_1970-08-08_092.pt|pitch/cooke_1970-08-08_092.pt|Nassau Point, Piconic Long Island, August 2nd 1939,
