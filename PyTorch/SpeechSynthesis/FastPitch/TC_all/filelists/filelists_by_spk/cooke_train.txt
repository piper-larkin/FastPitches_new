John Dean the former White House aide the man who more than any other had accused the president of knowing about Watergate and helping to cover it up a federal court decided that it had no power to release the tapes to the Congressional Committee but the same judge did order president Nixon to release the tapes to the court which would pass on what it took to be relevant to mr. Cox and his team the issue is now and only one remove from the judgment of the Supreme Court the president could turn over the tapes or he could refuse and bow as he promised to bow to the final ruling of the Supreme Court at this point the president did neither he proposed to compromise whereby the tapes would be heard in private by a certain senator senator John Stennis a southern Democrat a friend of mr. Nixon but a man allowed by all parties to be of unimpeachable honesty he would decide what concerned Watergate and would let mr. Cox see the full transcript he would also decide what concerned national security and he would pass on a written summary of that without the text the senate Watergate Committee was willing after several backings and fillings to go along with this but special prosecutor Cox was not nor was judge Sirica the chief judge of the United States District Court in Washington who ordered mr. Nixon to turn over the tapes to him through all the seething speculation and legal arguments and newspaper comment the White House made its defiance of the courts very clear indeed when illegal aid to the White House crisply summed up the president's position which was that the president cannot be convicted of a crime and cannot even be indicted so long as he's in office and has not been impeached by the House and then removed from office by a two-thirds vote against him in his subsequent trial by the senate that was the moment when impeachment became not a threat but a practical possibility when the congress came back from holiday a week ago many impeachment resolutions were offered in the House and the senate judiciary committee has started looking into the justification if any for starting the formalities of impeachment suddenly the president changed his mind and the country stirred under a huge sigh of relief he will let judge Sirica hear the tapes in full for a day or two it did look as if we had a president who like some general of a revolutionary hunter was going to declare as the Supreme Court of Chile declared last week that henceforth the law would be what the general said it was but the press exploded and so did the American Bar associations the congress had had enough and most important of all judge Sirica did not quail he was ready to cite the president for contempt and the president came in there are from all indications many more black storms ahead for Richard M Nixon but after this first one a senator Irving likes to say the country is not in ruins the constitution is in effect and the republic still stands|5|64
