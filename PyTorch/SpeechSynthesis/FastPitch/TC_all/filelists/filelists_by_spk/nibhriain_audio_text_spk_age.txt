wavs/nibhriain_1971-02-07_002.wav|List was introduced to Gertel's Fouced by Berlius, and as with so many other 19th century artists, the story captured his imagination.|14|19
wavs/nibhriain_1971-02-07_003.wav|At that time, he held an appointment at Weimar, where he organised many excellent concerts, taught, and above all settled down to composition.|14|19
wavs/nibhriain_1971-02-07_004.wav|A Fouced Symphony, the first work he fully scored himself, was finished in two months during 1854.|14|19
wavs/nibhriain_1971-02-07_005.wav|Two years later, List added the final chorus, and gave the work its first performance, when it made a considerable impression.|14|19
wavs/nibhriain_1971-02-07_006.wav|It still regarded as one of List's finest achievements.|14|19
wavs/nibhriain_1971-02-07_007.wav|There are three movements, in which the three main characters, Fouced, Gretchen, and Mephistopheles, are portrayed.|14|19
wavs/nibhriain_1971-02-07_008.wav|The themes of the movements interact upon each other, in a way which suggests the interaction of the characters, and which helps to give the music a dramatic unity.|14|19
wavs/nibhriain_1971-02-07_009.wav|The first movement, Fouced, has five main tunes, each symbolising a different aspect of Fouced's character.|14|19
wavs/nibhriain_1971-02-07_010.wav|It seems very likely that List found himself in great sympathy with a man beset by opposing forces, and to some extent the movement is also a portrait of himself.|14|19
wavs/nibhriain_1971-02-07_011.wav|The second movement is a portrait of Gretchen, most delicately scored.|14|19
wavs/nibhriain_1971-02-07_013.wav|Fouced's themes join with hers in the middle section.|14|19
wavs/nibhriain_1971-02-07_014.wav|The remarkable and sinister finale depicts Mephistopheles, and in this movement the Fouced themes are mocked and paraded.|14|19
wavs/nibhriain_1971-02-07_016.wav|Everything transitory is merely an image.|14|19
wavs/nibhriain_1971-02-07_017.wav|The inaccessible here becomes fact.|14|19
wavs/nibhriain_1971-02-07_018.wav|The inconceivable here is being done.|14|19
wavs/nibhriain_1971-02-07_019.wav|A Fouced Symphony by List.|14|19
wavs/nibhriain_1981-10-02_001.wav|uh, did they, were they, their expectations, the expectations of them as, as men, were they worried about that?|14|29
wavs/nibhriain_1981-10-02_002.wav|Was it something that had worried them right through their lives, or was it only when you started asking them questions that they became aware of?|14|29
wavs/nibhriain_1981-10-02_004.wav|Did they feel that they're expected to carry too many loads, uh, and, and that maybe women were at fault in that?|14|29
wavs/nibhriain_1981-10-02_005.wav|How important were their relationships with women to them?|14|29
wavs/nibhriain_1981-10-02_006.wav|Yeah, what was their feeling about extramarital relationships?|14|29
wavs/nibhriain_1981-10-02_007.wav|Because a lot of them seem to have used them to sort of keep them going, if you like.|14|29
wavs/nibhriain_1981-10-02_008.wav|That again would, would be sort of cultural expectations as well, wouldn't it?|14|29
wavs/nibhriain_1981-10-02_009.wav|But do you think that that reflected badly on the relationship they had with their wives?|14|29
wavs/nibhriain_1981-10-02_010.wav|So there's the whole area of, of non-communication basically is the problem.|14|29
wavs/nibhriain_1981-10-02_011.wav|A lot of the men seemed to feel that they had been brought up to feel that, that their feelings should be mastered and controlled all the time.|14|29
wavs/nibhriain_1981-10-02_012.wav|How, how were their, their marital relationships on, on average?|14|29
wavs/nibhriain_1981-10-02_013.wav|Were they, were they happy with them?|14|29
wavs/nibhriain_1981-10-02_014.wav|Did a lot of them feel that marriage was for that?|14|29
wavs/nibhriain_1981-10-02_015.wav|I mean, I was looking at some of the, the, the stuff that, that the, uh, single men were saying, and a lot of those said, yes, they would like to be married because then they wouldn't be lonely.|14|29
wavs/nibhriain_1981-10-02_017.wav|And also they, they, they, they all seemed just terrified of failure of any kind, whether it was sexual failure or failure to provide for the family or whatever.|14|29
wavs/nibhriain_1981-10-02_018.wav|Did, did they see, uh, their wives are lovers as, as sexual partners or as friends or as both?|14|29
wavs/nibhriain_1981-10-02_019.wav|Did, did they feel that their sexual relationships with, with their wives were, were satisfying?|14|29
wavs/nibhriain_1981-10-02_021.wav|Did, did it turn out that that was true or not?|14|29
wavs/nibhriain_1981-10-02_022.wav|If, if they're as unhappy as, as it seems, uh, that they are in, in a lot of areas, do, do, do they feel that they, that they can change anything themselves?|14|29
wavs/nibhriain_1981-10-02_023.wav|Because, I mean, in your previous book, uh, on, on women's sexuality, it, they were disappointed with things and they felt it was generally the fault of the male culture.|14|29
wavs/nibhriain_1981-10-02_024.wav|Well, if that is the case, do the men feel that they have any responsibility or ability to change?|14|29
wavs/nibhriain_1981-10-02_025.wav|Well, you said, in, in the, in the preface to the book that you wanted to see, whether men were changing, do, what's your conclusion on that one?|14|29
wavs/nibhriain_1981-10-02_026.wav|I mean, do you think that they will change, that women will change or, or what?|14|29
wavs/nibhriain_1981-10-02_028.wav|Do you feel that any, any myths were demolished in, in the writing of this book?|14|29
wavs/nibhriain_1991-05-23_001.wav|that was Peggy Seeger, who I'm delighted to say joins me here in studio this evening for the program with her musical partner Irene Scott from Belfast|14|39
wavs/nibhriain_1991-05-23_002.wav|Peggy and Irene, you're both very welcome.|14|39
wavs/nibhriain_1991-05-23_003.wav|It's lovely to see you back in Ireland.|14|39
wavs/nibhriain_1991-05-23_005.wav|It was a very long and close musical and personal partnership.|14|39
wavs/nibhriain_1991-05-23_006.wav|How have you found coming to terms with it on both fronts, both the personal and the public?|14|39
wavs/nibhriain_1991-05-23_007.wav|Well, how has your performance and how has your material and all of that?|14|39
wavs/nibhriain_1991-05-23_008.wav|I'm assuming that it has changed because I assume that because you were a partnership, this is our number to compromise in a partnership and so you wouldn't have always given all of yourself.|14|39
wavs/nibhriain_1991-05-23_009.wav|You're, you're own background in music.|14|39
wavs/nibhriain_1991-05-23_010.wav|I mean, you, as you say, you played classical piano and so on, but through your parents and through, through your father, particularly, you've got a lot of that old traditional American music, didn't you?|14|39
wavs/nibhriain_1991-05-23_011.wav|Is that what, I mean, is that the kind of, it just struck me there.|14|39
wavs/nibhriain_1991-05-23_013.wav|I think you said you'd sing it for us in a moment called Wagner's Lad.|14|39
wavs/nibhriain_1991-05-23_015.wav|And it struck me just hearing you rehearse it there that you, I mean, you've become very involved and you've written a lot of the polemical songs, if you like, or, or, or, or song.|14|39
wavs/nibhriain_1991-05-23_016.wav|It's about issues that concern you and a lot of those have had to do with the women's movement.|14|39
wavs/nibhriain_1991-05-23_017.wav|But this one kind of combines both in a way, doesn't it, in the sense?|14|39
wavs/nibhriain_1991-05-23_018.wav|But would people constantly come up to you and say, Peggy, would you make a song about this, or did it just come naturally to you when, when, when something really got to you, that you would sit down and write about it?|14|39
wavs/nibhriain_1991-05-23_021.wav|I mean, what keeps you going as a, as a committed singer, songwriter?|14|39
wavs/nibhriain_2010-06-22_001.wav|yeah, it's an extraordinary list really, but it, it arose,|14|58
wavs/nibhriain_2010-06-22_003.wav|That's how they compiled it.|14|58
wavs/nibhriain_2010-06-22_004.wav|They came up with this vast number of, of people who had had to look up where it's now.|14|58
wavs/nibhriain_2010-06-22_006.wav|Maybe it is in America, everything's possible.|14|58
wavs/nibhriain_2010-06-22_008.wav|I'm not sure that, yes, maybe people are afraid that they would be showing off if they used a word that they don't use, whether even their breakfast, I don't know.|14|58
wavs/nibhriain_2010-06-22_009.wav|Language, I mean, the beauty of language is that we have so many words with which to express a variety of experiences and emotions, I'd say John would agree.|14|58
wavs/nibhriain_2010-06-22_010.wav|Well, will I be really humble, crawl onto the table and tell you the ones that I didn't know?|14|58
wavs/nibhriain_2010-06-22_011.wav|Things like apoplectic.|14|58
wavs/nibhriain_2010-06-22_013.wav|And so you get apoplectic.|14|58
wavs/nibhriain_2010-06-22_014.wav|Now, I had never actually thought of that.|14|58
wavs/nibhriain_2010-06-22_015.wav|So, there are a lot of words which I would have a sense of when to use, but I would be quite bad at actually describing.|14|58
wavs/nibhriain_2010-06-22_016.wav|So, that's one that I was amazed that people didn't know.|14|58
wavs/nibhriain_2010-06-22_017.wav|But, I mean, some of the ones I didn't know, comedy, there's an interesting word, I didn't know what that was, I've no doubt.|14|58
wavs/nibhriain_2010-06-22_018.wav|C-O-M-I-T-Y, and I thought, what a great word, you know what it means?|14|58
wavs/nibhriain_2010-06-22_019.wav|Carticy, civility, urbanity, kindly and considerate behaviour towards others.|14|58
wavs/nibhriain_2010-06-22_021.wav|So, as you go through life, you pick it up.|14|58
wavs/nibhriain_2010-06-22_022.wav|The only reason he and I know some rather arcane words is because we've been around enough along, and we would have been reading for most of our lives.|14|58
wavs/nibhriain_2010-06-22_023.wav|So, you don't at the age of 21 know everything about anything, actually, but bit by bit you pick it up.|14|58
wavs/nibhriain_2010-06-22_024.wav|And if you're aware of the fact that there are new words and you're willing to look and to learn them and to find out how to say them, but I don't think people should be embarrassed about asking.|14|58
wavs/nibhriain_2010-06-22_025.wav|John wrote on Saturday when you asked him, did he deliberately?|14|58
wavs/nibhriain_2010-06-22_026.wav|I don't think he does, but deliberately put in difficult words, but there were two,|14|58
wavs/nibhriain_2010-06-22_027.wav|I had to take out the dictionary twice, but I was delighted.|14|58
