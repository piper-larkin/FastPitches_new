wavs/cronkite_2001_003.wav|That's not quite the term for it, Larry.|6|85
wavs/cronkite_2001_004.wav|I don't, I don't miss being on the air.|6|85
wavs/cronkite_2001_006.wav|That's an important job and, uh, I miss that.|6|85
wavs/cronkite_2001_008.wav|That's, that's what a reporter wants to be, whether they write it for a newspaper.|6|85
wavs/cronkite_2001_009.wav|No, I'm not so sure of that.|6|85
wavs/cronkite_2001_011.wav|Uh, that's, I've, I've been credited with that, or devided with it, depending on how you look up on what a reporter's job should be.|6|85
wavs/cronkite_2001_012.wav|Uh, I was enthusiastic about space flight.|6|85
wavs/cronkite_2001_013.wav|I was very critical of many of the decisions that NASA made in the course of getting the man up to the moon eventually and then into the shuttles.|6|85
wavs/cronkite_2001_015.wav|And I think it will live as such in the 20th century.|6|85
wavs/cronkite_2001_018.wav|Uh, emotionally, certainly.|6|85
wavs/cronkite_2001_021.wav|It's the only time I really didn't caught up and thought I was going to lose it and did for a brief second managed to come back.|6|85
wavs/cronkite_2001_022.wav|You know, we, uh, I'm not ashamed of that in any way.|6|85
wavs/cronkite_2001_023.wav|Barnett Shaw talking on here last night about a motion, showing emotion on the air.|6|85
wavs/cronkite_2001_024.wav|I think he was entirely right.|6|85
wavs/cronkite_2001_025.wav|I don't think we should hide it.|6|85
wavs/cronkite_2001_027.wav|We're presumably human beings and are affected by these things.|6|85
wavs/cronkite_2001_029.wav|And, uh, we've only learned recently that there is a psychological effect that there needs to be trauma treatment for that sort of thing.|6|85
wavs/cronkite_2001_030.wav|It's only when you get back to your hotel room or back home or whatever that it hits you.|6|85
wavs/cronkite_2001_031.wav|What's, what's happened in the rest of the time your adrenaline is flowing and getting the job done just like those policemen, firemen, nurses and doctors.|6|85
wavs/cronkite_2001_032.wav|And, uh, that was much the same thing that day.|6|85
wavs/cronkite_2001_034.wav|Well, the, the, it happened within a month that for I stepped down when the, when they shot it to Ronald Reagan.|6|85
wavs/cronkite_2001_035.wav|And right away, I was in Moscow already.|6|85
wavs/cronkite_2001_036.wav|I'd, I'd take it a trip through doing some documentaries.|6|85
wavs/cronkite_2001_038.wav|And here I was halfway around the world.|6|85
wavs/cronkite_2001_039.wav|And here was the story and a tempered assassination of the president of the United States.|6|85
wavs/cronkite_2007_003.wav|Today, surely, they know to plan for the aftermath of any military action they undertake.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_004.wav|Bush's father, President George H. W. Bush, launched the first Gulf War in 1990.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_005.wav|He did so with the endorsement of the United Nations, but this invasion of Iraq was not approved by the UN.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_006.wav|What made the difference?|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_007.wav|In the United Nations, and we were able to lead a UN force to write that wrong.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_008.wav|We were the good guys then.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_009.wav|In the current war, our case was not at all clear to others.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_010.wav|We had no UN sanction, and we began to look like the bully on the block.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_011.wav|There's another lesson we should take from this terrible misadventure.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_012.wav|Before the invasion, Colin Powell tried to explain something very basic to George Bush.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_013.wav|Powell quoted what he said was the pottery barn rule.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_014.wav|If you break it, you bought it.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_015.wav|If you destroy a government and social order, you are obligated to replace them.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_016.wav|You own that government's responsibilities.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_017.wav|I should say we own them for it wasn't just George Bush, Dick Cheney, and Donald Rumsfeld who broke Iraq.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_018.wav|It was the United States.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_019.wav|The entire nation volunteered for this war.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_021.wav|It passed with a large majority.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_022.wav|Most members of Congress and the American public were convinced that if we failed to act, there was danger of a nuclear attack.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_023.wav|In the future, we should be more wary of false alarms.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_024.wav|Now we are stuck there.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_025.wav|We're not sure just how or when we can leave honorably.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_026.wav|How can we pull out of Iraq without civil war exploding in a blood bath?|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_028.wav|And Bush has said he expects some American troops to be in Iraq for years.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_029.wav|Maybe that's our penance for letting George Bush and Dick Cheney stampede us into war.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_030.wav|Maybe that's our punishment for not asking the hard questions early enough.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_031.wav|I guess the ultimate lesson is that being a democracy, we the people are responsible for the actions of our leaders.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_032.wav|Bush's aggressive talk about Iran and its nuclear ambitions is a case in point.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_033.wav|Now we learn that the Iranians stopped developing nuclear weapons in 2003.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_034.wav|We now are in the midst of the primary campaigns for next year's presidential election.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_035.wav|Perhaps we will pay closer attention to what the candidates have to say about America's role in the world.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_036.wav|So what kind of person with what kind of attitude and ideas do you think should be making decisions about that?|6|91
wavs/cronkite_2007_037.wav|Surely the most important lesson Iraq teaches us.|6|91
wavs/cronkite_1963_001.wav|there has been an attempt that's perhaps you know now on the life of president Kennedy.|6|47
wavs/cronkite_1963_003.wav|We have not been told their condition at Dallas in the downtown hotel room, a group had been gathered to hear President Kennedy when he was waiting his arrival.|6|47
wavs/cronkite_1963_004.wav|Let's switch down there now where Eddie Barker of KRLD is on the air.|6|47
wavs/cronkite_1963_005.wav|This is Walter Cronkite back at the CBS newsroom in New York.|6|47
wavs/cronkite_1963_006.wav|We have just been advised from Dallas that blood transfusions are being given to President Kennedy.|6|47
wavs/cronkite_1963_008.wav|However, let's go back to KRLD in Dallas.|6|47
wavs/cronkite_1963_010.wav|It was just an hour ago that the incident took place.|6|47
wavs/cronkite_1963_012.wav|Regarding the probable assassin, the sheriff's officers have taken a young man into custody at the scene.|6|47
wavs/cronkite_1963_013.wav|A man 25 years old, we are...|6|47
wavs/cronkite_1963_014.wav|We just have a report from our correspondent Dan, rather in Dallas, that he has confirmed that President Kennedy is dead.|6|47
wavs/cronkite_1963_015.wav|There is still no official confirmation of this, however, it's a report from our correspondent Dan, rather, in Dallas, Texas.|6|47
wavs/cronkite_1963_016.wav|President Thou is fine.|6|47
wavs/cronkite_1963_019.wav|Vice President Lyndon Johnson has left the hospital in Dallas, but we do not know to where he has proceeded.|6|47
wavs/cronkite_1963_020.wav|Presumably, he will be taking the oath of office shortly and become the 36th President of the United States.|6|47
wavs/cronkite_1990_001.wav|oh no, not shocking, but it's awfully pleasant, I must say.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_002.wav|You know, particularly after not having been on daily news for nine years now, it's a long time, it's amazing to hold a whole half a generation practically.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_003.wav|I was, I was very pleased with that reception, obviously.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_004.wav|That's the, I have the slightest idea.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_005.wav|I, uh, I don't spend much time examining my own navel.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_006.wav|I don't really know what, uh, what, what that might be from really.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_007.wav|I, I've always, uh, and doing the broadcast and, and my life, I've tried to be me.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_008.wav|I have never tried to be anything else.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_009.wav|I've never taken any diction lessons, obviously, or or electrocution lessons or performance lessons of any kind.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_010.wav|I've never, uh, never been an actor.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_011.wav|I've, I've just tried to communicate as best I can, uh, what I consider to be the important news of the day.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_012.wav|And, uh, that's doing my job.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_013.wav|And if, uh, if that's the kind of happy rub off while I'm delighted.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_015.wav|That is a terribly demanding job, uh, not just the daily, uh, program, but also being the sort of lead broadcaster for the network.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_016.wav|It meant that every time a story broke, you were there, which was, of course, the name of the game.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_017.wav|That's where I wanted to be.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_018.wav|You had to study constantly to do the space shots when we were having a lot of those.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_019.wav|And, uh, they were all, uh, covered, uh, live.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_020.wav|I spent a lot of time at Cape, uh, Kennedy now, or Cape Canaroa, yes, appears again.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_021.wav|Uh, and, uh, and then, uh, of course, politics covering elections and conventions.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_022.wav|That took a great deal of time.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_023.wav|So it was, uh, it was, uh, really a very demanding job.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_024.wav|Is it a demanding job?|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_025.wav|So I worked my way up to retirement.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_026.wav|Unfortunately, I find it, uh, more demanding than, than the job of people asked me to do a lot of interesting things.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_027.wav|And, uh, and that there be an interesting, I can't help but say yes.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_028.wav|And, uh, like these books, and that, that was just really more out of personal interest than any particularly huge revenue out of them.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_029.wav|Uh, the, um, but Betsy has taken now to standing over me with the phone rings.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_030.wav|And she mows the word no and shakes her head violently and tries to shake me off because I really bite off more than I can chew.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_031.wav|Uh, after, you know, almost 50 years of that, uh, it's, uh, was 40 years when I stepped down, I guess.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_033.wav|That's, that's, that's a very exciting business.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_034.wav|And it's kind of hard to, to let, let go of that.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_035.wav|Uh, I'd expected it to be difficult.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_036.wav|And it hasn't been any more difficult than I anticipated.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_037.wav|I actually, perhaps, even, perhaps a little less.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_038.wav|Well, I think that, uh, that the Middle East is, uh, such a complex political problem.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_039.wav|Uh, the motions are so high.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_041.wav|Very difficult for us to understand the people and to get along with those people.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_042.wav|Their rivalries between themselves are so great.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_043.wav|They have never succeeded themselves in any kind of a meaningful alliance.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_044.wav|I think for us to depend on our alliance with them, uh, is, uh, foolhardy.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_045.wav|And I think we're getting in much deeper than, uh, then, good, prudent operation demands.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_047.wav|Because, uh, it's a major, uh, source of information for one thing.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_048.wav|Uh, second of all, it's, uh, it's a major source of entertainment for the people.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_049.wav|Can be provided with, uh, no cost to them.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_050.wav|I can't see why in the world.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_051.wav|You would want to, I want to change it.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_052.wav|It's a, the logic simply says, why, why fiddle with something that works?|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_054.wav|But don't, don't supplant free television and radio with something else by government or any other reason.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_056.wav|Uh, and I realized there wasn't exactly a family support.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_058.wav|I got involved in that and, uh, never looked back.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_059.wav|It captured my imagination immediately.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_060.wav|I'm kind of a Walter Mitty.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_062.wav|Uh, I think I'm a pretty good one.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_063.wav|Uh, I'm, I'm incredibly calm.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_065.wav|The book, I'm glad you asked.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_066.wav|Uh, the book is West Wind, done with a superb artist, whose name Ray Ellis, internationally recognized.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_067.wav|He's had a couple of very successful shows overseas.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_068.wav|Uh, this is the third really.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_069.wav|It turned out to be a trilogy, wasn't planned that way.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_070.wav|Our first book was South by Southeast on the Southeast Coast United States, then North by Northeast, Northeast Coast United States.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_071.wav|And this book West Wind, the covering the entire Western coast from San Juan Islands down to actually Ensenada, Mexico in a sense.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_072.wav|The books are books of paintings.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_073.wav|They're, they're, they're art books.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_074.wav|Uh, I just do the text.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_075.wav|They're really Ray Ellis's books.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_077.wav|I, of course, sail them.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_078.wav|Uh, the, uh, we don't do that together.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_080.wav|And, uh, this is the way the book comes together.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_081.wav|Uh, just as soon as I write it.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_082.wav|And, uh, I think that might be sometime in the next year or so.|6|74
wavs/cronkite_1990_084.wav|Meanwhile, don't forget to buy West Wind, you can get it at your local bookstore.|6|74

wavs/cronkite_1979_006.wav|Plant officials predicted radiation will continue to leak at least five more days.|6|63
wavs/cronkite_1979_007.wav|Governor Thornberg considered then rejected the evacuation of a million residents in four counties surrounding the plant, York, Kadoffin, Lancaster, and Cumberland.|6|63
wavs/cronkite_1979_008.wav|But the governor urged that pregnant women and young children within a five mile radius leave the area, and he closed all 23 schools there.|6|63
wavs/cronkite_1979_009.wav|About 20,000 persons live in that section, and the governor told all residents within 10 miles of the plant to stay indoors until further notice.|6|63

wavs/cronkite_1986_002.wav|There will be, of course, long investigations and examinations of what happened today at Cape Canaveral.|6|70
wavs/cronkite_1986_003.wav|The argument will be buttressed for those who have been opposed to manned space flight all along.|6|70
wavs/cronkite_1986_004.wav|They'll now add the question of safety to their arguments.|6|70
wavs/cronkite_1986_005.wav|And, of course, their engineers will have to look very carefully at what happened today to make sure that it doesn't happen again.|6|70

wavs/cronkite_1995_006.wav|No drugs were found, please said an informant had given them bad information.|6|79
wavs/cronkite_1995_008.wav|81 years ago, in 1914, America declared war on drugs, passing this nation's first law against narcotics.|6|79
wavs/cronkite_1995_010.wav|We'll ask whether this war is being won, whether indeed it can ever be won as it is now being conducted.|6|79
wavs/cronkite_1995_011.wav|And then we'll look at some alternatives.|6|79
wavs/cronkite_1995_012.wav|Alternatives cropping up here and there across the land that suggest if we can't win this war, perhaps we can find ways to peace.|6|79
wavs/cronkite_1995_013.wav|That's the subject of tonight's crime guide report, the drug dilemma.|6|79
wavs/cronkite_1995_015.wav|It's estimated that over those same ten years, federal, state and local governments together have spent one hundred and fifty billion of our dollars fighting drugs.|6|79
wavs/cronkite_1995_016.wav|As Americans, we've not only the right, but the duty to ask, is that money will spend?|6|79
wavs/cronkite_1995_018.wav|And the government estimates that almost forty million Americans continue to use drugs right now today at least once a year.|6|79
wavs/cronkite_1995_019.wav|Ten years into the old out war, America has the highest rate of drug use per capita in the industrialized world.|6|79
wavs/cronkite_1995_020.wav|There's at least some good news.|6|79

wavs/cronkite_1995_022.wav|Largely white, middle and upper-class cocaine users, has dropped steadily since 1985, from twenty-two million to around twelve million.|6|79
wavs/cronkite_1995_024.wav|What do we do now?|6|79
wavs/cronkite_1995_025.wav|Redouble our efforts, pour ever more billions into the war we've been fighting these past ten years, get tougher still, build more prisons?|6|79
wavs/cronkite_1995_027.wav|Most of our states now put more new funds into prisons than to educating our children.|6|79
wavs/cronkite_1995_028.wav|So I visited Bedford Hills to find out what kind of women were in here and what their long imprisonment was costing them and their children and us.|6|79
