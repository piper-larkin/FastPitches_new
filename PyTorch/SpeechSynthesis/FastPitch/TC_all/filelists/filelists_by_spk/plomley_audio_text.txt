wavs/plomley_1985_029.wav|No.

wavs/plomley_1978_006.wav|Do you run your little farm commercially?
wavs/plomley_1978_007.wav|Yes. They used to leave pigs on most barren islands so they could all come and, yes, you're really in the banger business.

wavs/plomley_1978_009.wav|Where were you born?

wavs/plomley_1951_003.wav|on Margaret what sort of cast-weight do you think you'd be on a desert island?
wavs/plomley_1951_004.wav|yes I should think so.
wavs/plomley_1951_005.wav|what I meant to say was, how efficient would you be at looking after yourself?
wavs/plomley_1951_006.wav|well I mean cooking yes but lighting a fire first.
wavs/plomley_1951_007.wav|oh I mean, yeah.
wavs/plomley_1951_008.wav|could you build a hut to live in?
wavs/plomley_1951_009.wav|I'm worried about you.

wavs/plomley_1951_011.wav|what's your first record?
wavs/plomley_1951_012.wav|I'm not sure that it's meant to be not for the poor chefs in the boat.
wavs/plomley_1951_013.wav|very pleasant music there.
wavs/plomley_1951_014.wav|what next?
wavs/plomley_1951_015.wav|well you're rather a busy person, aren't you?
wavs/plomley_1951_016.wav|which part of the opera do you choose?
wavs/plomley_1951_017.wav|sorry you can't have the rest of La Traffiata.

wavs/plomley_1951_023.wav|would you like to say that again louder we may give somebody an idea?
wavs/plomley_1951_024.wav|beautiful.
wavs/plomley_1951_025.wav|next you're very keen on boating songs Margaret who then had just left eaten.
wavs/plomley_1951_026.wav|do I detect in that that you're a bad sailor?
wavs/plomley_1951_027.wav|I seem to remember a few years ago you were in the film about the sea.
wavs/plomley_1951_028.wav|yes I think that was it.
wavs/plomley_1951_029.wav|if you're seeing a very old joke the rulers of the sea hadn't ruled it smooth enough for you.
wavs/plomley_1951_030.wav|let's take one island at a time.
wavs/plomley_1951_031.wav|she's already following in your footsteps in the theater.

wavs/plomley_1951_034.wav|now what's your last one going to be?
wavs/plomley_1951_035.wav|now you've one more choice to make Margaret as well as your eight records in your gramophone you may have a luxury object.
wavs/plomley_1951_036.wav|any luxury you like must be anything useful like a frying pan or an axe.
wavs/plomley_1951_037.wav|do you want the answers or not?
wavs/plomley_1951_038.wav|well if I have a pencil I think we'll get a pencil.
wavs/plomley_1951_039.wav|well here comes the rescue ship and we've reserved a suite for you on A deck.
wavs/plomley_1951_040.wav|is that a right?
wavs/plomley_1951_041.wav|well thank you Margaret for being shipwrecked for us and letting us hear your choice of desert island discs.
wavs/plomley_1951_042.wav|goodbye everyone.
wavs/plomley_1968_001.wav|John, where were you born?
wavs/plomley_1968_002.wav|What was your first ambition as a boy?
wavs/plomley_1968_003.wav|At Harrow, did you play in the school plays?
wavs/plomley_1968_004.wav|And what happened?
wavs/plomley_1968_005.wav|How did you get in there?
wavs/plomley_1968_006.wav|Mm-hmm.
wavs/plomley_1968_007.wav|Where all the films you did about the western desert?
wavs/plomley_1968_008.wav|Mm-hmm.
wavs/plomley_1968_009.wav|And you went on doing this till the end of the war.
wavs/plomley_1968_010.wav|And after that?
wavs/plomley_1968_011.wav|And what about your bar exams?
wavs/plomley_1968_012.wav|Yes.
wavs/plomley_1968_013.wav|Did things happen fairly quickly?
wavs/plomley_1968_014.wav|You got some briefs?
wavs/plomley_1968_015.wav|Now you had written your first novel, so this was the pattern for some time at novels and legal work.
wavs/plomley_1968_016.wav|When did you switch to writing plays?
wavs/plomley_1968_017.wav|Yeah, fine.
wavs/plomley_1968_018.wav|There's two short plays with which you started your dramatic career.
wavs/plomley_1968_019.wav|I've to be real money spinners, John.
wavs/plomley_1968_020.wav|I mean, the doc brief in particular, how many countries has it been played in there?
wavs/plomley_1968_021.wav|And of course, it's been done on television, everywhere.
wavs/plomley_1968_022.wav|It's been filmed.
wavs/plomley_1968_023.wav|It was the first of a number of radio and television plays.
wavs/plomley_1968_024.wav|What was your first full length play for the theatre?
wavs/plomley_1968_025.wav|Mm-hmm.
wavs/plomley_1968_026.wav|Things must be easier now because some of them will grow up, but I know at this time you had six children and and and step children about the house.
wavs/plomley_1968_027.wav|How did you manage to get any work writing done at all?
wavs/plomley_1968_028.wav|Are you a methodical?
wavs/plomley_1968_029.wav|Do you work certain hours every day?
wavs/plomley_1968_030.wav|Yes.
wavs/plomley_1968_031.wav|You produced yourself a film version of one of your short plays, Langehaw.
wavs/plomley_1968_032.wav|And I know you had a number of trips to Hollywood to work on other people's scripts.
wavs/plomley_1968_033.wav|Yes.
wavs/plomley_1968_034.wav|What was your next full length play?
wavs/plomley_1968_035.wav|You went over to the enemy for a while and were a drama critic.
wavs/plomley_1968_036.wav|You've also written a ballet.
wavs/plomley_1968_037.wav|Mm-hmm.
wavs/plomley_1968_038.wav|And you've done an adaptation from the French flee in her ear, which has been a great success.
wavs/plomley_1968_039.wav|You did the screenplay of that as well.
wavs/plomley_1968_040.wav|And recently another full length play, The Judge.
wavs/plomley_1968_041.wav|Most modern playwrights who have any serious intent to given labels by the critics.
wavs/plomley_1968_042.wav|I mean, Surnsay writes plays about the difficulties of human communication.
wavs/plomley_1968_043.wav|And Surnsay has obviously a crypto Marxist and so forth, but what label have you been given through?
wavs/plomley_1968_044.wav|Now in the legal field, you recently become a QC.
wavs/plomley_1968_045.wav|Does this mean more legal work for you or less?
wavs/plomley_1968_046.wav|As a writer, is there any one subject that you want to write a bite?
