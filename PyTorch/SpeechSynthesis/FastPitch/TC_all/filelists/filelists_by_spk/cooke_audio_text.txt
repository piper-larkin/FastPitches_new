wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_001.wav|I have something I ought to talk about and something I must tell you about.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_002.wav|What I ought to talk about is the 1974 General Assembly of the United Nations.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_003.wav|What I must tell you about is an encounter I recently had with the Russians, which is insignificant, coccyde and hilarious.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_004.wav|We leave that as the icing and get down to the cake.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_005.wav|It's been tea time talk for 10 years or more that the United Nations has been going downhill as the world organization able to keep the peace.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_006.wav|Though if you challenge people to say why, you get only a confusion of vague replies.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_007.wav|So I think I ought to say as clearly and briefly as I can why I think it's gone down.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_008.wav|The overriding aim of the United Nations was firmness stated on the day of its birth in San Francisco 29 years ago.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_009.wav|In the first sentence of its charter to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_010.wav|And the way to do that everybody present agreed was to give the United Nations a force, a physical force stronger than that of its strongest members or of any coalition of them.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_011.wav|They said it all in one article of the charter article 43.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_012.wav|It binds all the member nations to make available to the Security Council on its call and in accordance with the special agreement or agreements armed forces, assistance and facilities including rights of passage necessary for the purpose of maintaining international peace and security.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_013.wav|These agreements were to be negotiated as soon as possible.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_014.wav|Well the simple disastrous truth is that they have never been negotiated.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_015.wav|No nation feels obliged to make available to the Security Council a bow and arrow let alone the bulk of its armed forces.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_016.wav|So the United Nations has never had the force to assert the authority it claims because none of us is willing to accept an international verdict against our own national interests.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_017.wav|I believe it's as unavoidably simple as that.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_018.wav|So now to the session of the General Assembly that has just ended with such a menacing bang for the Western world.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_019.wav|To put it as forcefully and fairly as possible let's recall the annual assemblers of the 1940s and 50s and 60s.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_020.wav|For four years we had rousing meetings, much promise of much good to poor countries and many expressions of peaceful intent among the powerful.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_021.wav|But the Russians were a nuisance at best, at worst a constant threat to the independence of countries in the Middle East.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_022.wav|They kept on using their charter right to veto every Security Council resolution that called for force or international action in any place that interested them.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_023.wav|So in 1950 the Americans and the Britons got together and pushed through an assembly resolution giving the right to call for arms to the assembly where the Russians veto couldn't be used.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_024.wav|Why were the Americans and the British able to do this?
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_025.wav|Because they were absolutely top-dog at the time and they could always count on the supporting vote of an actual majority which was made up of what the Russians called our satellites and what we called all good men and true, namely Western Europe and the Latin American nations.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_026.wav|Today the UN which started with 50 member nations has 138 and the majority is made up neither of our satellites nor the Russian satellites.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_027.wav|It's sometimes known as the Third World.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_028.wav|It is in the main the poor countries of Asia and Africa.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_029.wav|In this assembly the Russians voted with them automatically just to be sure the Chinese didn't monopolize the role of the poor man's friend.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_030.wav|This year for the first time the new majority flexed its muscles because it was backed by the Arab countries whose citizens may be poor but whose leaders are rich enough to threaten our own wealth if not to annex it.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_031.wav|So the Arabs were the biceps of this muscle man show and Algeria was the brains or ideological guide.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_032.wav|Together they managed to get South Africa actually barred from the assembly.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_033.wav|They got UNESCO to deny money and cultural help to Israel.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_034.wav|The first time a nation has been so blackboard.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_035.wav|The Israelis indeed were battered and besieged and profoundly humiliated when the assembly president and Algerian ordered the chair on which Pope Paul had sat in 1965 to be taken from the storeroom and placed on the podium to honor the special invited guest, the guerrilla leader Mr. Arafat.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_036.wav|All in all it was a humbling session for the white man for Western Europe for the United States and for the Latin Americans for all the old reliable Western majority.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_037.wav|The majority has swung to the black men and the brown men and the yellow men and it looks as if the future of the UN were theirs to dictate.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_038.wav|Well that's the, is the rather indigestible piece of Christmas cake now for the icing.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_039.wav|A few weeks ago when I was in San Francisco I had a call one morning inviting me to lunch with the Russian consul general and his deputy.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_040.wav|The invitation came from an unlikely host, a friend of mine, who is a lawyer, an affable gent, a republican and a first-rate golfer.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_041.wav|He is indeed the chairman of the championship committee of the United States Golf Association and he was throwing a little lunch for the consul general at the golf club not simply by way of convenience.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_042.wav|Golf he said was to be the main reason for the lunch.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_043.wav|Now this was like being invited by a rabbi to lunch with the Pope to discuss stud poker I accepted instantly.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_044.wav|The co-host was a young American, a boyish type out of Disney who is associated with his famous father in the most successful golf architect's firm on earth.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_045.wav|Golf architecture is the art of designing and building golf courses and involves much knowledge of landscape, grasses, water drainage, engineering, meteorology and sometimes I feel black magic.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_046.wav|Let's call the young man Mr. Jones for that is his name.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_047.wav|He had recently returned from Moscow where he and his father had responded to what must have first sounded like an incredible call from the mayor of Moscow to build the first Russian golf course.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_048.wav|The impulse apparently had come from a Soviet diplomat who had been exposed to the west and become one mad golfer, the only Russian golfer of whom we have any knowledge and curiously he was not bundled off to Siberia to play golf with a little red ball and a snow sledge.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_049.wav|Somehow he sold the mayor of Moscow on the idea.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_050.wav|I don't imagine things are allowed to rest there the matter went up to the Kremlin and from all I could gather Mr. Brezhnev gave the nod.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_051.wav|Well the consul general turned out to be a rumply, rye-faced man with a puckish humor.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_052.wav|When we asked him if the Russians would take the golf he said, you see the Russian people like quick games and somebody said like chess he came back on the hop we like a quick win.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_053.wav|He plainly and admittedly knew nothing but he asked everything and to help him with the rudiments young Mr. Jones put on a lantern lecture with color slides showing rice paddies in bank cock being transformed slide by slide into bulldozed open ground ground laid with gravel and water.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_054.wav|The local city of Moscow and Seed and soil planted an eventually appearing as a pastoral golf course and we went so to speak to Hawaii and Florida and Scandinavia and in the end to the four sites around Moscow from which they will choose the one on which to build the course.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_055.wav|After that the consul general had to have a lesson in weaponry golf Winston Churchill said is a game whose aim is to hit a very small ball into an even smaller hole with weapons singularly ill designed for the purpose.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_056.wav|We went off in electric carts like a little motorized battalion to the eleventh tee on this noble San Francisco golf club course a swaying rolling landscape of brilliant green meadows and hills towering with cypress and pine and eucalyptus.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_057.wav|The eleventh hole is a par three that's to say you're required to hit the green with your first shot and sink the ball with two puts.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_058.wav|Our lawyer took off his coat straight in his wester took a four iron set up the ball and stood to the ball.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_059.wav|Offhand I would bet ninety ninety one any time that he would hit the green.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_060.wav|Well he hit about six inches behind the ball which rose in an unsteady arc and landed about 120 yards away in front of a deep bunker.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_061.wav|Dear me he said with admirable restraint so said the deputy consul the first pancake is never any good.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_062.wav|Ignoring this gem of Russian folk wisdom the lawyer set up another ball in this time he was well up on the green.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_063.wav|Now the consul general was motion to play.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_064.wav|He too took off his coat and looked down at the ball seized the club with the baseball grip his two hands far apart.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_065.wav|Missed the ball at the first swipe at the second fell just a little shot of the lawyer's first ball.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_066.wav|There was general applause a natural talent per our lawyer.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_067.wav|Please said the consul general and then the deputy had a go and he slithered the ball about thirty yards along the ground.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_068.wav|That deputy one man whispered to me he sure knows what he's doing.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_069.wav|We then all departed for the clubhouse had our pictures taken and the consul general was given by young Mr. Jones.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_070.wav|A copy of an article that I once written on the origins of golf.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_071.wav|Mysterious this why I asked young Jones.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_072.wav|He looked over his shoulder to see if there was a CIA man behind a tree.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_073.wav|Because he said don't you see it reinforces the main argument and what would that be.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_074.wav|I realized then that the argument had come up in Moscow and that we'd kicked it around at lunch.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_075.wav|It really touched on our main curiosity why should the Russian leaders the gods of the proletariat want to embrace such a capitalist amusement as golf.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_076.wav|The consul general had dropped more than a knowing hint that he knew it was a rich man's hobby.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_077.wav|All unaware of why I'd been seated next to the consul general at lunch I hastened to disabuse him.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_078.wav|With young Mr. Jones later assured me in deeply moving eloquence.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_079.wav|No, no, I said that used to be so no more even then only in England and America never in Scotland.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_080.wav|No, why Scotland?
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_081.wav|I painted a poignant picture all the more effective because it was true.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_082.wav|Of little poor boys barely able to walk going off with their sticks and paying a few pennies to play the most hallowed courses on earth.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_083.wav|In Scotland I said the people learned to play golf as simply as they learned to drink tea.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_084.wav|And St Andrews the Vatican of golf, pardon the the Kremlin, is a public course on Sundays they close it so that little old ladies and dogs and babies can frolic around for it is a public park absolutely for the people.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_085.wav|No, said the consul general.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_086.wav|Yes, I said.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_087.wav|What he asked warming to the people's sport will our people do will they succeed at this sport?
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_088.wav|I was warmed up too by this time I can tell you.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_089.wav|Ten years from now I declared there had been a couple of stimulants before lunch.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_090.wav|The British or American open champion will be a Russian.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_091.wav|Five years from now there will be a match between the best player in the world, Jack Nicholas and Nicholas III.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_092.wav|There was never any Nicholas III said the deputy.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_093.wav|There will be I cried and he will win.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_094.wav|So I like to think that a year, two years from now when Mr. Brazinev stands on the first tea and declares the first golf course in Russia open, he will carry a note or two compiled from our San Francisco lunch and he will proclaim to a vast assembly of the peoples of all the Russia's.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_095.wav|So let us begin to play golf.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_096.wav|The people's sport.
wavs/cooke_1974-12-23_097.wav|Happy New Year.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_001.wav|our plane was coming in from San Francisco, nosing in through endless layers of cotton wool, with the rain streaming against the windows, no land in sight, till we suddenly spun out of a ground mist and hit the runway.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_002.wav|As the brakes roared on and the plane slowed to make the long taxi to the terminal, the captain came on the public address system.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_003.wav|He said there was something he wanted to tell us, not by way of sensationalism, he said, about something that had happened in mid afternoon.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_004.wav|I assumed there had been some trouble with the plane, and he had sensibly waited to tell us about it till we were safe and sound.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_005.wav|He was mumbling very low into his microphone.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_006.wav|I think he didn't want to sound as he put it sensational.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_007.wav|Unfortunately, he could hardly be heard, something about the president and secretary, and then he said it a little more clearly.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_008.wav|Two and a half hours ago an assassination attempt was made on the president, and he was now in surgery in a Washington hospital.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_009.wav|It was something he thought we ought to know.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_010.wav|At Kennedy, which used to be idol wild airport before the assassination of that president, people waited for their baggage, and I don't think the most imaginative or hyped-up reporter could have seen anything different in the behavior of the people from that of any other day.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_011.wav|Maybe there was less jocular small talk.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_012.wav|Most people looked tired and patient.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_013.wav|Perhaps by now, we are resigned to atrocity, as infantrymen get used to seeing dead bodies.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_014.wav|We happened to get possibly the only Chinese cab driver at the airport who spoke little English and had no radio.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_015.wav|So it was nearly an hour before we were home and turning on the television and seeing there almost like a cruel replay of Dallas 1963, startled, secret servicemen, people falling to the ground, and a sudden scrum of men huddled over a young man.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_016.wav|Fortunately, for the country, the anxious hours were blessedly few.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_017.wav|The first authoritative spokesman, the man who conducted an evening press conference at the hospital, was one Dr. Dennis O'Leary, the dean of clinical affairs at George Washington University Hospital.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_018.wav|And by great good luck, he was one doctor in a thousand.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_019.wav|In that, he had an immediate air of candor and pleasant authority.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_020.wav|He sensed in a flash what sort of language would enlighten people without alarming them.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_021.wav|He had humor when it was appropriate to have it.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_022.wav|He was responsive to intelligent questions and courteously non-committal to idiotic questions.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_023.wav|And he was able, as doctors very rarely are, to translate the abominable jargon of his trade into sensible and even subtle English that any of us could understand.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_024.wav|Of course, the fate so with him, the president had been jaunty about his wound.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_025.wav|He had the luck of what Dr. O'Leary called fine physiological health, a very young, 70-year-old, and the bullet had stayed inches away from a fatal point of entry.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_026.wav|Still looking back on it, I think we all owe an enormous debt to Dr. O'Leary.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_027.wav|He's young enough to have come to take for granted what actually scandalized an older generation, namely the expectation that the press would want to know all the medical details and had a right to have them.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_028.wav|I digress here, but I hope to the point.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_029.wav|This tradition is very new.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_030.wav|I remember the shock of the ordinary people of New York when a tabloid daily came out with a headline 20 odd years ago.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_031.wav|John Foster Dulles has inoperable cancer.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_032.wav|That was the positive end of the old tradition of reticence, which allowed a man, however, distinguished, to face the end with his family in privacy and in dignity.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_033.wav|We were already ennured to this historical shift in journalistic practice when President Eisenhower had his heart attack.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_034.wav|Day after day in Denver, his doctor came before the media and described everything in great detail down to the consistency of the President's power movements.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_035.wav|And ever since then, a public man hides from the press the symptoms of any affliction, however mild, at his peril.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_036.wav|Obviously, it's become harder and harder for a doctor to instruct a layman in the facts without leaving little loopholes through which the dumber sort of journalist will fish out lurid inferences.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_037.wav|We've come a long way indeed from the day, not a hundred years ago, when the President of the United States, Grover Cleveland, could be taken out to sea on a yacht, operated on for cancer of the throat, returned to the White House, convalesced there and recover, and nobody know a thing about it until years later when he was dead.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_038.wav|So what Dr. O'Leary did on the evening of the wounding of the President was to restore the morale of the country in a decent and authoritative way.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_039.wav|He was helped, of course, by being able to report the heartening fact that the President had shown an almost huckish bravery of spirit.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_040.wav|Dr. O'Leary deserves the Medal of Freedom, especially because the scene in the White House, where you would properly expect authority to take hold, was a muddled and for a time a faintly alarming one.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_041.wav|I'm afraid the culprit here was General Hague, the Secretary of State.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_042.wav|It is quite true that he was very shortly after the shooting, the senior member of the Cabinet, who happened to be on hand.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_043.wav|But he had once decided that since the Vice President was flying back from Texas, he, Mr. Hague, was now in charge of the government.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_044.wav|Of course, he wasn't.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_045.wav|President declared himself disabled, unable to continue in office.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_046.wav|Or the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet told in writing the Pro Tem President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House that the President was unable to discharge his duties.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_047.wav|Then and then only, the Vice President becomes acting President.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_048.wav|This is all set forth quite precisely in the 25th Amendment to the Constitution.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_049.wav|Suppose that the President dies and after him or with him, the Vice President.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_050.wav|The succession then goes to the Speaker of the House.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_051.wav|He is third in line.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_052.wav|But Mr. Hague, when all about him might have been losing their heads, rushed onto television with darting eyes and a sweaty forehead.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_053.wav|He was nervous and he was dogmatic.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_054.wav|He was, he said, in control.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_055.wav|In charge.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_056.wav|He could have been in control in a purely practical sense at the moment, but his fatal remark came when he was asked why.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_057.wav|He mentioned the Constitution and repeated the GAF that the Secretary of State succeeds after the President and the Vice President, thus showing as one commentator put it, an incredible lack of understanding of constitutional succession.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_058.wav|And there's another line of succession which has to do with the command structure of the Pentagon, the military.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_059.wav|When Mr. Hague got away from his unfortunate performance on television, he went back to what is known in the White House as the situation room, the place where crucial military decisions are made.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_060.wav|In variably in the presence of the President, who remember is the commander-in-chief of all the armed forces.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_061.wav|There the Secretary of Defense, Mr. Weinberger, felt it is duty to tell Mr. Hague that he was not in charge of that structure either.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_062.wav|The command passes from the President to the Vice President and then to the Secretary of Defense.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_063.wav|Nobody but Mr. Weinberger.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_064.wav|All together, an acutely unhappy time for Secretary Hague.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_065.wav|But he and the people were put right at once by the chief Washington correspondents of two networks.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_066.wav|One of the more stupid but I suppose inevitable questions put to Dr. O'Leary of all political neutrals was whether or not there was evidence of a conspiracy.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_067.wav|He wouldn't think of commenting on that.
wavs/cooke_1981-04-03_068.wav|And from what we know and we know a great deal about the life and character of the pathetic John Hinckley, he was no more of a conspirator than the equally pathetic 18-year-old bartender who fired twice on Constitution Hill at the very young Queen Victoria and missed.

wavs/cooke_1981-08-07_067.wav|Anyway it's over.
wavs/cooke_1981-08-07_068.wav|As a social matter the upshot is that the player is not only no longer hired help at however huge a fee.

wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_011.wav|I wonder if a couple of years ago we'd been shown the faces of Olga Corbert and Mark Spitz.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_012.wav|If we could possibly have guessed, they had devoted their lives respectively and exclusively to gymnastics and swimming.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_013.wav|Now, nobody knows better than motion picture casting directors that we see in a face what we bring to it.

wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_015.wav|Old-time moviegoers may recall that William Powell was for a long time cast as a villain and Colonel Law as an oriental seductress.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_016.wav|They really didn't find themselves until some unsung genius spotted that if you considered Powell's moustache as a c'mon and his bulging eyes as those of a drool and amiable clubman, he could become a very agreeable switch on a hero.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_017.wav|And that if Mona Law stopped narrowing her cold black eyes and stopped wearing spit curls and long beads, she was in fact an enchanting and tolerant wife of the same William Powell seen from the new angle.

wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_019.wav|This rather elaborate introduction is a cautious or precautionary way of bringing up a game that is now being played all over America.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_020.wav|There are very few people seem to see it as a game and one that's full of vanity and peril.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_021.wav|It's the game of first guessing what Watergate has done to Mr. Nixon and then saying that you can see it in his face.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_022.wav|The press has been having a fortune tell us, feel day tapping everybody who knows the president or has known him from his daughter to congressman, old college friends, random navy acquaintances from the second war.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_023.wav|Since Mr. Nixon has been in the public eye for a quarter of a century it surely a little late to be doing a character analysis on him.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_024.wav|But demonstrably he is a baffling character and while I've met nobody I can think of who has fundamentally changed his or her first impressions.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_025.wav|The pollsters are counting by the millions the people who once trusted him and apparently trust him no more.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_026.wav|So much so that the latest Harris poll which down the years and whenever a finding could be proved has been only a percentage point or two in error.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_027.wav|The Harris poll reported last week that three Americans in four are still not convinced that the president was not in on the Watergate cover-up.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_028.wav|Now this poll was taken after the president made his nationally televised speech about Watergate.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_029.wav|Most people called it disappointing and there was a widespread feeling of skepticism verging on sarcasm about two points.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_030.wav|They had to do with his main reason for not releasing the tape recordings of conversations with his aides with one aid in particular that most people seemed to think would absolutely clear him or incriminate him.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_031.wav|The reason was and Mr. Nixon was very earnest and measured about it that there are certain precious relationships whose confidence should never be broken.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_032.wav|Confidentiality is the lawyers and now the White House would such as that between a lawyer and a client a priest and a penitent, a husband and a wife.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_033.wav|I wonder how many millions of listeners talk back to the box.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_034.wav|How about the relationship between a doctor and his patient?
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_035.wav|For what everybody had in mind was the president's approval of having his secret White House investigating team known as the plumbers.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_036.wav|Break into the office of Daniel Ellsberg psychiatrist with the admitted intent of rifling the files and finding the doctor's confidential record on his patient.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_037.wav|The second point was an even more glaring example of the president's seeming at any rate to be delivering a sincere sermon against the very thing he practiced.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_038.wav|I mean the secret bugging or taping of every conversation that took place in the three main rooms at the White House.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_039.wav|It seemed odd for the president to be teaching us so gravely about the sacredness of confidential conversations when he was always the only person present who knew they were being recorded.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_040.wav|Five minutes after the speech was over I was in a cabin riding uptown and the driver said in a few choice words what apparently a majority of Americans felt then or since.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_041.wav|The driver said who did he think he was talking to?
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_042.wav|A kindergarten?
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_043.wav|He should tell me what's sacred.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_044.wav|Now the president I think it's well established and told his advisors that his television address was to be the final speech on Watergate the clincher that would convince the people drop Watergate overboard and leave him unburdened to sail the ship of state.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_045.wav|Well plainly the speech didn't do it Watergate will not sink it bobs around that ship of state like a floating mine that in a rough sea is maddeningly and always out of reach.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_046.wav|So last Wednesday the president tried again he held his first press conference in five months and though it's a sensible purpose was to announce that Dr Henry Kissinger is to succeed Mr. Rogers.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_047.wav|As Secretary of State with the consent of the Senate the questions flowed on about Watergate and the president talked with an openness that might have done him much good three or four months ago.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_048.wav|He said he had delegated responsibility for investigating Watergate to one of the directors of his campaign committee who turned out to be a key conspirator in it.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_049.wav|Also to one man in the White House who delegated responsibility to another the White House legal counsel the president never took it up with his closest pal and advisor John Mitchell.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_050.wav|He resigned Attorney General because he said he thought that if Mitchell knew anything about it he'd have mentioned it.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_051.wav|That's a weird confession of naïve day like not believing strong evidence that your country's being invaded unless your army chief of staff brings it up.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_052.wav|The president did not say again what must have been an audio to admit to a national audience that he the president of the United States had all the resources of the FBI and the CIA and his closest White House advisors and pals all working on it and yet everything he was told for nine months was wrong.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_053.wav|Now this is what sticks in the people's crawl and apparently I do believe the president is one of the few people who doesn't see it.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_054.wav|I found the televising of his press conference fascinating because I felt that he really did look older, gentler almost humbled by the merciless pressure he's been under and I mean the pressure of the unanswered facts that will not go away.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_055.wav|The papers and the television soothsayers tell us that the president is a changed man.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_056.wav|He has marked swings of mood who doesn't.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_057.wav|He broods, he takes lonely walks then he's boisterous and cheerful for a time and then withdrawn again.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_058.wav|Well maybe when I hear such stuff however impressively dressed out with psychological jargon I always remember the old American Vordville comic who used to say to his pal a mine of alarming and intermine of alarming and intimate gossip.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_059.wav|Waschudair Charlie certainly however there was one moment that made me feel a quite new impulse of compassion for this subtle strange man.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_060.wav|He could now bring up the one's taboo word of resignation.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_061.wav|Now he would not resign he'd been elected to do a job and for the next three and a half years he was going to do it which is to make this world safer for this generation and the next and make life better.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_062.wav|For the people at home and their children after them he deeply deplored Watergate but now it was behind us it was all over.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_063.wav|Now this was the moment he gave that hesitant chuckle which to his admirers signifies a spasm of genuine modesty and to his haters a hint of your eye heap.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_064.wav|We've had he said 30 minutes of this press conference I have yet to have one example one question on the business of the people he didn't say it defiantly with his jaw out and the invisible flag waving as he often does.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_065.wav|He had once said quietly wasn't criticizing the press he just found it curious that they went on and on about Watergate and in that moment he was almost trembling red-eyed truly at bay.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_066.wav|A proud prisoner worn ragged by the drip drip drip of the tap that's never turned off.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_067.wav|In the last great scandal that swirled around the White House the crockery and successful greed that was kept 50 years ago from President Harding the verdict of history is already in.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_068.wav|Harding was a friendly courteous magnificent looking dope a dupe of his cronies his kitchen cabinet.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_069.wav|Mr. Nixon says that years from now the verdict of history will turn in his favor will record admiringly what his administration did for they talked with the Russians and the Chinese.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_070.wav|Maybe it will be so in as the president wistfully put it in the long run but alas few of us few people in certainly politicians never live their lives in the long run.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_071.wav|It's the short run that all of us have to cope with the short run is indeed the business of our lives.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_072.wav|And I'm bound to say that in that one plaintive moment when the president begged them to turn off Watergate and talk about the business of the people.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_073.wav|I for one felt he could well be saying to himself in the words of the old slave song.
wavs/cooke_1973-08-25_074.wav|Sometimes I'm up and sometimes I'm down and sometimes I'm almost to the ground.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_001.wav|good morning.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_002.wav|many years ago about this time of the year, just before an American election, unlike this year, a so-called midterm election, a congressional, not a presidential year, I had a letter from an Englishman of, I'm sure, an now vanished type.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_003.wav|I guessed his character from the style and tone of the letter, and the county address that sounded like a woodhouse invention, say dripping lodge, pitchville, upper draining on the marsh, and the picture that came to mind was one of my favorite characters in the whole of fiction, the incomparable galahad Thripwood, first described as a dapper man in his fifties in a small checked coat, tight trousers, and a gray bowler hat with racing glasses bumping against his left hip, his bright eyes watching them rounding into the straight, his neatly-shod foot seeming to pour in search of a brass rail.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_004.wav|The letter began, my dear fellow, if I may make so bold, please do us the kindness of not going on about the coming American election.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_005.wav|It's hopelessly incomprehensible to us.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_006.wav|That love having to follow our standard form of chess, but in yours the pawns move backwards, the bishop seem to move in any direction they choose, and there's no king on queen.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_007.wav|My dear chap,
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_008.wav|I think we'd be grateful with your telling us just the gist, and if there are two gists, then bungalong both of them.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_009.wav|Forgive my rude intrusion on your most admirable, weekly chore, and if I may give my compliments to your lady-wife.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_010.wav|I'm sure Old Gala had spoke for many more than Britons, and for many other types.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_011.wav|I shall do my best to oblige, and tell you why a gist this time may be hard to come by.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_012.wav|Due to the towering crash of a new, all-powerful computer system that left us with only the punches and the pundits instead of the certainties that were meant to replace them.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_013.wav|First, though, I must pay homage to the political parties that never get mentioned, the 31, 31 political parties, apart from the Democrats and the Republicans.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_014.wav|Their existence reveals a fairly substantial minority of people who have a bee in their bonnet, who are obsessed with one issue, replacing fossil fuels by next year, preserving the spotty dowel, making women belong into men's clubs that don't want them.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_015.wav|The return of prohibition to the abolition of cities, as well as outright socialism.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_016.wav|There are three socialist parties, each not liking the others to brand or definition of socialism.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_017.wav|There's also a green party and a laskin independence party, an earth federation party, a vermont grassroots party, and on and on.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_018.wav|Of all these 31 offbeat parties, there's one party in a presidential election year, a third party, what you might call the major of all the minor parties.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_019.wav|And that third party, which is never one, can cause defeat from one of the two main contenders, the Democrat or the Republican.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_020.wav|And that happens when the third party man acts as a stalking horse and produces what we call a minority president, most famously Bill Clinton.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_021.wav|Ran the first time against President Bush going for a second term.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_022.wav|Bush would have won easily, but a row is a little mantemcock Texan, one Ross Perot, ran as a third party.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_023.wav|And he took just on 20 million votes away from Bush.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_024.wav|In the result, although 45 millions voted for Clinton, 59 millions voted against him.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_025.wav|And he lost the electoral vote.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_026.wav|Perhaps the most famous case of all was disclosed so late that very few Americans to this day know about it, it's the year of the appalling hassle over the Florida count, the year 2008.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_027.wav|AD.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_028.wav|When both parties claimed they had won the electoral vote of Florida, we'll come to the electoral vote in a minute.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_029.wav|You recall that both parties called in a regiment of lawyers or two regiments and filed claims and counterclaims of fraud or failure to record votes because the voting system failed, always too difficult to handle.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_030.wav|Well, long after the whole Ruckus or Rumpus was over and the Supreme Court decided to throw the Florida verdict back as the Constitution dictates to the Florida courts, it was disclosed that if three large western states with small populations and therefore small electoral votes had given only 5% of the third party man as vote, a man named Ralph Nader.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_031.wav|Gore would have been president without dispute.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_032.wav|Well, back to what is normally the dramatic setting of the television networks on election night with a huge map of the United States and graphs and these winking electronic panels.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_033.wav|Even though the polls only close at 7 p.m. Eastern time, the anchorman and their spies throughout the country were always ready to predict by spies, I mean journalists, employees of the networks who stood on the street in every state outside the polling places.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_034.wav|They caught people on their way home and stopped them and asked them which way they'd gone.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_035.wav|Millions of people were quite willing to reveal their secret vote.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_036.wav|The results were fleshed to the network headquarters, accumulated by a computer at each network and when a positive result seemed indicated the anchorman would put an electric tick by a candidate's name and he would then proclaim this network projects Michigan has gone to a bush or in the Senate race in Mississippi the Democrats have added another seat.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_037.wav|Well, last Tuesday night was for now or two or three the biggest flop in the history of election coverage.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_038.wav|I couldn't figure out what had happened promptly at seven o'clock and then at eight and then at nine I switched to a dozen stations famous for their newest coverage and neither they were telling us that the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission had resigned or they were showing a love scene in which handsome and respectable lovers were kissing in the modern fashion, not kissing but competing in a tonsil chewing contest.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_039.wav|At 10 o'clock suddenly everything was back to normal including the anchorman showing ticks in the margin of projected winners.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_040.wav|Mark the word projected.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_041.wav|A presidential year is most exciting because the crucial electronic panel counts the electoral votes each candidate is winning.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_042.wav|Now an electoral vote number is assigned to each state as an index or reflection of its population.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_043.wav|Thus California has 54 electoral votes given of course to the winner of the popular vote and the scantily populated New England state of Vermont has three electoral votes.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_044.wav|Well two years ago came in time early in the evening when two of the big networks of the big three excitedly gave Florida to Mr. Gore and his electoral vote went over the required majority of 270 great excitement across the nation but more Florida votes came in and the two anchorman began to hem and haul and retract and say Florida was too close to call then one gave it to Bush and then both retracted and as you know 36 days later we knew this appalling foul up left two networks with egg on the anchorman's faces and they're very worried look on the faces of everybody else in the news gathering business.
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_045.wav|So all of them the network cable stations press agencies got together and financed a new improved neutral system it was a huge complicated computer or rather a whole large room of computers it would receive an immense volume of data or data gathered from tens of thousands of exit posters not employed by any network the details of every election would be fed into this marvelous monster it would wait till the winner of any contest was plainly a winner and then the magic monster would flash the same word to everybody fine by evening the whole system broke down and by ten o'clock the networks were told sorry better go back to your own spies they did but it was remarkable how often the anchorman would then say it appears that when they were reporting a landslide this three-hour delay in even getting the numbers passed over as a bewilderment about what had happened nationally and why we went to bed like the natives of more backward countries to get the results in the next day's papers in our case it was two days later and that's for the gist of what it all means when we discovered the republicans had a mighty victory the big brain hasn't worked it out yet so we had to listen to the opinions of party leaders the democratic leader in the house who is going to give up as leader said that September the 11th and fear of war with Iraq made people stay with president Bush as a sort of well protector one thing both parties agree on is that the president's five-day air trip of 10,000 miles and quick rousing little speeches in 15 states and 17 big cities might have none wonders but certainly gave a Philip to the candidates he spoke for
wavs/cooke_2002-11-08_046.wav|so sorry jala head no just just yet we're forced back on the commentators and politicians hunches yeses and maybees as in the olden time before the invention of the miraculous computer
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_001.wav|good morning.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_002.wav|It's been 30 years since John F. Kennedy was elected to the presidency and in his inaugural speech, the following January he declared that torch has been passed to a new generation.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_003.wav|Well, since he was the second youngest president in history, we all applauded and said quite right.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_004.wav|But the leaders, both European and Asian, that Kennedy was going to have to deal with where in their 60s and 70s, Macmillan, the gold, Mao Zedong, Adonawa, and they would be in power when he'd gone after the short less than three years of his reign.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_005.wav|And his successor, Lyndon Johnson, though barely 10 years older than Kennedy, was a veteran politician who'd started in politics 30 years before with Roosevelt's new deal and believed in its ideals and its methods.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_006.wav|So really, looking back on it now, we can see that Kennedy was a false blip on Times radar screen.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_007.wav|He would today be 75 and all his contemporaries are long gone from government.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_008.wav|But if Mr. Clinton were to echo the same phrase in his inaugural, he would be more surely speaking the truth.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_009.wav|Nothing is more striking during this transition time than the youth of the new faces and the voices that speak for Clinton.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_010.wav|The economic advice is the press spokesman, the men, so far only men, who appear on television and say what the new administration is to be about.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_011.wav|After a few weeks of our getting to know these people who will form his camp of cronies or kitchen cabinet, as we say, President Bush suddenly seems like a Chelsea pensioner.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_012.wav|He's only 68, but then only four presidents out of 41 have been as old as Mr. Bush was at his inauguration.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_013.wav|The man who fooled us and scrambled the record was of course the immortal Ronald Reagan, the oldest man ever to enter the White House, a year older than George Bush leaving it.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_014.wav|If there's one remark more than another that indicates the positive passing of an old order, it's the reflection somebody made the other day that George Bush is probably, I would say, certainly the last veteran of the Second World War who will come to the presidency.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_015.wav|The war to Clinton's generation means Vietnam and even at that he was only just old enough as we learned many times over during the campaign to be eligible for the draft.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_016.wav|I've noticed for instance that no contemporary American politician ever talks about Korea as a United Nations war.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_017.wav|When it's mentioned it's by old judges who pass on to the young, the thought that Korea was an all-American war and probably not worth it.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_018.wav|When the Korean cease fire was instituted, William Jefferson Clinton was five years old.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_019.wav|So the recognition that from the 20th of January on we really are about to enter a new American era has come to people in different ways but the recognition is there, it's general and I'm happy to tell you that for the time being anyway it has given the American people a lift in its simplest form.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_020.wav|The lift is the one you get from a new coach, a new team and the hope that they have something racing to offer.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_021.wav|I have friends who never had the slightest intention of voting for Mr. Clinton, some of whom stayed with Bush to the end, some of whom decided at the last minute to register a protest against both principal candidates and go for Mr. Paro.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_022.wav|I've been surprised to discover how many of them say they're coming round to the idea that Clinton's victory was probably a good thing and begin to have hopes for him.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_023.wav|This feeling has surprisingly passed over onto Wall Street and I'm sure has a lot to do with the first certain signs after more than two sluggish years that the American economy really is stirring into life.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_024.wav|The awful truth which George Bush must find unbearable to dwell on is that he was right in the last month or so of the campaign when he insisted that the economy was finally improving.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_025.wav|But he'd been saying that for a year in the face of joblessness, poverty, increasing despair among the industrial states, this time he was right.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_026.wav|But the sure signs did not appear until mid-November and of course this constitutes the luckiest possible break for Clinton.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_027.wav|Though whatever your political allegiance you have to admit that Clinton had nothing to do with it.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_028.wav|Come to think of it, it's doubtful that a president ever has anything to do with the health and sickness of the economy.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_029.wav|But it's a deep and unshakable popular belief that whoever is in the White House is like the manager of a football team solely responsible for its performance.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_030.wav|The only grain of truth in this delusion is that as the old Italian playwright, Piran Dello, put it, it is if you think it is.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_031.wav|And even the most sophisticated, the most tortured economist will admit that whatever else affects the stock market, one strong influence is public confidence.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_032.wav|So it may be that although the economy was improving at election time all on its own, yet the general superstition, if you like, that things were likely to get better under Clinton gave the economy the boost that was necessary to demonstrate its return to health.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_033.wav|I report this trend with all the more alacrity because of the bleak contrasting picture we get and I'm sure you get of Europe, Europe in the Waldronz, the dead in the water condition of the Maastricht Treaty and the prospects for European Union.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_034.wav|The continental wide recession made wider still by the lapse in German prosperity.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_035.wav|What Mr. Clinton seems to have convinced enough of the voters is that he's a different Democrat, that he would forsake the 60-year-old Democrats devotion to deficit financing.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_036.wav|John Main and Cain's is weighty legacy to the century, that he does not mean to be, in Mr. Bush's gutsy simplification attacks and spend liberal.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_037.wav|That phrase, harped on incestancy by Mr. Bush during the autumn, was not plucked out of the air.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_038.wav|It takes us back to an embatalled time in American political history.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_039.wav|In the mid-summer of 1938, President Roosevelt's closest personal adviser, one Harry Hopkins, a very sick midwesterner, who heroically overcame his illness during the war.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_040.wav|The second war took contrive Lens Lees to keep the Soviet Union in the United Nations to see Europe repaired and restored through the Marshall Plan.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_041.wav|Harry Hopkins was at a racetrack in New York and turned to his companion, a New York theatrical producer, and said,
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_042.wav|I propose of the next big policy move of the New Deal, we will spend and spend and tax and tax and elect and elect.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_043.wav|In fact, there's no proof Hopkins ever said it, but he could have.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_044.wav|It was such a lively, memorable phrase, and it did express albeit an ruthless form.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_045.wav|The general philosophy of the New Deal, that in no time it was picked up by Republican speakers and Roosevelt haters everywhere and paraded an intoned at every political meeting as the warning of the crushing future Roosevelt had in store for all of us.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_046.wav|And it's astonishing to realize now how much political violence the Republicans have got through successive presidential campaigns, out of the threat that the Democrats knew no other political strategy than to tax the people into ruin.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_047.wav|When this year's campaign began, it's easy to forget now, Governor Clinton was way behind Mr. Bush in the polls, partly of course because he was unknown to the country at large, but also because he was the Democrats' latest candidates and could be assumed to be following in the footsteps of all previous democratic contenders, all the way back to the original taxer and spender, the dreaded Franklin Roosevelt.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_048.wav|Well, as I say, we may not have seen it by election time, but by now it's clear that Mr. Clinton pulled off a small but decisive miracle of political persuasion.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_049.wav|He really did convince enough voters, including Wall Street and the financial world, that he did not believe taxes were the only or the best way to get revenue.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_050.wav|That tax forgiveness, helping business, big and little to new investment, was the vital impulse of an improving economy.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_051.wav|He also made it clear in his 12 years as Governor of Arkansas that welfare was a crutch and should be fallen back on only for so long.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_052.wav|Only as long as the patient could get on his feet and instead of moaning over his lost job, get trained for a new one.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_053.wav|Governor Clinton's job training program, developed at the expense of public funds for a perpetual dough, has been so successful in Arkansas, it was the main reason why, at the last Governor's conference last year, the 49 other governors voted him the most successful governor in the country.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_054.wav|That accolade now doubt offered a powerful incentive to run for the presidency.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_055.wav|Well, I'd love to go on bringing reassurance and good cheer in this report.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_056.wav|I suggest you that America finally dragging itself out of the slough of recession might beckon to and help a floundering Europe.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_057.wav|But suddenly the rosy domestic picture has faded in the past week and Governor Clinton is faced with a problem in foreign affairs as dire as anything since Vietnam.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_058.wav|Of course, it is President Bush's initiative to send 28,000 troops into the hellhole of Somalia.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_059.wav|He has briefed Mr. Clinton every step of the way.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_060.wav|But Mr. Bush has perhaps fatally jeopardized President Clinton's future initiative by saying now that this mission is a police action which will be finished by the 20th of January the day of President Clinton's inauguration.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_061.wav|What this cocky assurance does is to tip off the warlords or gangsters that they can rest up while American soldiers protect the food deliveries, no point in fighting the fears of American Marines, and then resume their civil war and their looting from the famished once the Americans have left.
wavs/cooke_1992-12-04_062.wav|The Pentagon for once defying a President's judgment says the mission cannot have a deadline that the troops might be there well into the new year, when it will become President Clinton's decision, whether to call it quits or to wade into a civil war and get stuck in a quagmire, the size of Texas.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_001.wav|good morning, I'm flying west again to California, but with an overnight stop at Dallas to talk to some students.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_002.wav|The airlines have warned us of longer, more bothersome security checks and advised us to be at the airport as much as an hour earlier than usual.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_003.wav|So, I'm there 90 minutes before the flights due to leave, and it takes me about three minutes at the check-in counter and 15 seconds to go through the metal detector, a record.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_004.wav|Why?
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_005.wav|Because to anyone who flies at that time of the day, nine in the morning, the airport looked as I imagine it looks at three in the morning.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_006.wav|A great empty chasm, so few people flying and no lingering friends and families, they're forbidden now to greet people at the gates.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_007.wav|So, they've got the message and apparently are not showing up in large numbers.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_008.wav|The only conspicuous innovation having to do with security is obvious the moment you get out of your cab.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_009.wav|There is no more sidewalk baggage checking in.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_010.wav|That's to say, I forget now, I'm not sure it's a normal procedure in Europe, it's not in Britain, I think.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_011.wav|But if you're flying anywhere within the United States, you normally get your bags deposited right there on the sidewalk, English pavement, and a porter, so dressed anyway, looks at your ticket and puts the necessary tag.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_012.wav|The destination tags on your luggage and he sees that they're trundled inside and sent off to the loading platform.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_013.wav|For some no doubt good and thoughtful reason, I can't quite figure out this security procedure is enforceable at airports for the duration.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_014.wav|A very small price to pay for whatever safety they have in mind.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_015.wav|At Dallas, the university officials, two young ladies who were going to meet me, were down at the baggage claim area and looked like two lone, lawn creatures stranded in the desert.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_016.wav|Dallas Airport is, I believe, I'm sure, physically the largest airport in the world and even in the thick of the tourist season with people flying in all directions, it has the air of a vast modern construction, a giant gymnasium or cathedral, say, a cathedral with wall to wall, practically neat and knee, carpeting.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_017.wav|So that hundreds of people stalking around looked like the strolling midgets in a cannelletto painting and make no more noise than a convention of kittens.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_018.wav|But this time the airport looked to me to be at most a quarter full and it was in the Dallas news that I read about the heavy slump in airplane travel, most of all in tourist travel, just about everywhere in Europe, in the Middle East, of course.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_019.wav|And even here one reads in every paper and magazine about the secret hysteria that seems to have overtaken hordes of traveling Americans, including I notice a movie star famous or notorious for his portrayal of a muscular machine gunning hero, the new stereotype of the Ganghou martial American at his worst.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_020.wav|Before I left New York, I took this up with one fairly celebrated showbiz star, normally a drowl and sensible woman, who I should have guessed would not be put off her stride or her travels by ten Saddam Hussein's.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_021.wav|But she was canceling a trip here or trip there because I was made to feel like a crettin because of terrorism stupid.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_022.wav|Well, I suggested that if she took a plane every day for the next year to almost anywhere on earth except maybe Baghdad or Tel Aviv, the chances of her being terrorized would work out at one in several hundred thousand, maybe a million.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_023.wav|Whereas anyone who, at any time of the day, walks across Madness and Avenue takes his life in his hands.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_024.wav|Yes, yes, she knew that, no avail.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_025.wav|Saddam Hussein thou hast conquered.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_026.wav|After Dallas, I flew on to Southern California to Orange County, which is south of Los Angeles.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_027.wav|And if I tell you that the airport is named the John Wayne Airport and when you drive out of it, you're soon on MacArthur Boulevard, you will gather that you're not in democratic country.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_028.wav|You could win for sure, anytime you care to bet that nowhere in prosperous Orange County is there an Adley, Stevenson Equestrian statue.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_029.wav|Or even, I should guess, a building named after Frank and Roosevelt.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_030.wav|However, the university, a secular university, I mean it's not a Baptist or a Catholic university, is certainly not recruited from the Republican legions who infest Orange County.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_031.wav|It's part of the State University system we all know about the University of California at Berkeley and UCLA University of California at Los Angeles.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_032.wav|Well, they are pretty crowded both for numbers and for building space.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_033.wav|And the university I was visiting is UCI University of California at Irvine.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_034.wav|A community came up like a giant mushroom in the past 30 years.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_035.wav|This campus is only 25 years old.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_036.wav|They have 16,000 students.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_037.wav|And because they own about 400 acres of open land, a great marsh on which I was told eager and bird watching students huddle before the dawn, they are required to double their registration to 32,000 by 2080.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_038.wav|This and much more about a splendidly equipped university, I learned before I was privileged to talk to an audience of about 1200.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_039.wav|I do not mean to sound coy in saying privileged.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_040.wav|For there were 10 other events going on that evening, concerts, performances in other auditoriums, stadiums, concert halls, with which the campus appeared to amount.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_041.wav|Including a university basketball game, a science lecture, a performance by the university Symphony Orchestra.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_042.wav|By the way, how many universities can you name that have their own student recruited Symphony Orchestra?
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_043.wav|During a busy 36 hours, I did not bring up the war.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_044.wav|I was waiting for the students and or the faculty to do that.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_045.wav|I discovered later, they stayed mum out of nothing but courtesy.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_046.wav|They did not want to throw out the side long suggestion that the subject of my talk ought to have been on the war or at worst the strain of it on the domestic front.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_047.wav|But finally, after the lecture, so called, was over and there was an informal get together, I did bring up the war.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_048.wav|I'd seen, of course, polls which show even on the college campuses a very big majority in support of the war.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_049.wav|I say carefully in support, not in favour.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_050.wav|I wish the poll takers would be pedantically careful in the way they frame the questions about the war.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_051.wav|I suspect there has never been a war in which populist support is so shadowed by misgivings and opposition so embarrassed by qualifications.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_052.wav|It seems so anyway among the students.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_053.wav|I noticed on the way to the reception on a notice board a sheet of paper announcing in crayon a meeting, a protest meeting against the war.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_054.wav|On the other end of the board was another notice, a pro-war meeting.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_055.wav|I was told that these antagonists had not so far visibly or physically antagonized each other.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_056.wav|Once recently indeed they'd met together and argued.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_057.wav|Rising I was told to strong differences of opinion but stopping well short of mayhem, or of the sort of howls of malice and hatred.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_058.wav|That disfigured many such campus confrontations during the Bedlam that accompanied the Vietnam War.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_059.wav|Well for one thing remember it's a volunteer army.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_060.wav|Nobody has been drafted yet.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_061.wav|For another the opponents the protesters do not have the main rationale they used during Vietnam.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_062.wav|They believe or the illusion that the North Vietnamese were third world Democrats fighting to oust a western power as they had ousted the French.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_063.wav|And a powerful impetus to the Vietnam protesters had been given by both General MacArthur and former president Eisenhower, both of whom had urged first president Kennedy and then Johnson not to get involved in the war.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_064.wav|But even to the most downright peacenic Saddam Hussein is not as he is by the way to more and more Arabs.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_065.wav|A hero saving the Arab world from the detested the invading western superpower.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_066.wav|He is condemned right left and center for his annexation of Kuwait.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_067.wav|He is watched and feared for his remembered use of chemical weapons against his own Kurds.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_068.wav|He made a glaring psychological error when he paraded those obviously named or beaten up prisoners of war.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_069.wav|And at the moment the protesters do not seem to have made clear to themselves an effective alternative to enforcing the United Nations resolution approved by 28 nations which for the first time in 45 years and finally sanctioned the use of force in an international dispute.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_070.wav|Something the United Nations was created to do.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_071.wav|Three weeks ago at the beginning of the war most protesters condemned the Allied coalition for not having stayed with the imposition of United Nations sanctions.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_072.wav|But since that time much disheartening proof has come out about leaks in the embargo system amounting to a regular flow of goods and material from Jordan, Iran and Syria to go no further.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_073.wav|However, unlike any previous war this one is seen in every home being waged producing vast devastation and the deaths of harmless people.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_074.wav|Television penetrates what was always the remote disasters of war.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_075.wav|And it alone will ensure I believe that the anti-war protesters will come into their passionate heyday if the land war goes on for long.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_076.wav|And the casualties mount into the thousands, the tens of thousands, a fear that haunts the White House, the Pentagon, the High Command and makes the support for the war large but fragile.
wavs/cooke_1991-02-08_077.wav|Good night.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_001.wav|good evening.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_002.wav|Both Britain and the United States have been given a black eye in the past week by things so seemingly slight as a bridge game and a boxing match.

wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_013.wav|My elder daughter I well recall was very scared some years ago to go to England for the first time because she felt that everybody lived in Regency houses and walked around charming pieces by Sheraton and Heppelwhite spouting Shakespeare and Milton.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_014.wav|I tried to brace her by telling her that she knew more Shakespeare and Milton than the average and had lived with more Sheraton and Heppelwhite than most.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_015.wav|I think maybe the time has come to get back to the background of American life in these talks which I deserted a year or two ago quite deliberately.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_016.wav|On the theory that since many European universities, even schools, have got themselves courses in American history and since Hemingway and Faulkner got the Nobel Prize and since the great spate of American plays that went abroad in the forties and fifties and the wide publicity given to such superb modern architects as Edward Stone, Philip Johnson, Minoro Yamasaki or such composers as Charles Ives and Aaron Copeland and so on and so on.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_017.wav|I figured that the groundwork had been laid.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_018.wav|The elementary knowledge of the American tradition had been absorbed.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_019.wav|Apparently this is a delusion.

wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_046.wav|One calling for a federal investigation the other asking the California attorney general to look into the prospect of withholding from the promoters the money in California that they're entitled to from movie theater television.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_047.wav|All this indignation may for once lead somewhere since the boxing profession itself seems to be more outraged than anybody.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_048.wav|The most offensive debasement of boxing that I've ever seen or read about that was not spoken by a bishop or a pious politician but by Jean Tunning.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_049.wav|It's awfully early to tell what'll come out of it but what seems most likely at the moment is the appointment by Congress of a national government agency like the baseball commission that was created after an unholy baseball scandal.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_050.wav|Boxing would then be run by a commissioner.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_051.wav|While the experts and the people involved are talking along these lines ordinary people are still gasping and arguing over unexplained mysteries about the actual running of the fight.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_052.wav|One could have said ironically after the fight that it was a mystery why Lichten went down and a bigger mystery why he stayed down.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_053.wav|But after several days there really is a mystery and the wonder is why it should have occurred to laymen and not to the experts.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_054.wav|It has to do with the principle or rule on which Lichten was declared knocked out.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_055.wav|The international boxing rules not to mention the rules of the main boxing commission also state quite clearly that the count may not begin until the boxer responsible for the knockdown has retired to a neutral corner.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_056.wav|The referee, poor old Jersey Joe Wilkert who's taken as frightful a verbal beating as Lichten did in the record books, was not kneeling there thrashing his forearm over the strangely prostrate body of Lichten because he was doing his best to see that the rule was followed.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_057.wav|He was waving caches or Muhammad or whatever he calls himself away.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_058.wav|By the most straightforward reading of the rules Lichten wasn't knocked out at all.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_059.wav|To be absolutely impeccable Wilkert should have scissored a signal to the timekeeper not to start watching the count, for its estranged professional boxing match in which the count is decided by the timekeeper.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_060.wav|In strict truth the fight is not yet over which is certain of the most awful thought of the year.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_061.wav|When about 36 hours late this point was put to one of the main officials he said that after all Lichten was in a pretty bad way and he was certain to be knocked out sooner or later, Wilkert said that Lichten was so badly hurt, how, why, that he would probably have had to be stopped from going on.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_062.wav|All that the officials decided to do was change the actual time of the knockout since the playback of the television tape showed that they had been at least 45 seconds out.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_063.wav|The most unlikely people, old men and maidens, have got into this argument.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_064.wav|Nobody is prepared just yet to say why the whole exhibition was a disgrace which I think is an interesting point.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_065.wav|Of course it's annoying to get ready for one of these things and Sally fourth and pay big money every ticket to the movie house is cost two pounds ten and then be offered only two minutes of so-called entertainment.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_066.wav|I've asked several people as a reporter not as a dissenter what was disgraceful about it strangely they cannot tell you but this is I suspect only because they sense that they're treading on the soft ground that could suck you into a libel suit.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_067.wav|In other words some people shall we say don't like the fact that both the winner and the loser get exactly the same purse for their performances.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_068.wav|Some people don't like the relations of the boxes with the promoters.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_069.wav|Some people therefore suspect hint suggest that there might possibly be fraud.

wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_071.wav|Still I can't remember a sporting event of any kind which has galvanized so much outrage and indignation among its own devotees.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_072.wav|The general public was soured on boxing long ago not through the suspected operations of raccoteers so much but because of the number of boxes who had the bad luck to be killed in the ring.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_073.wav|For this reason more than any other professional boxing is banned in several states of the union.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_074.wav|After last Tuesday you may be sure there will be many more.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_075.wav|But I come back to the note on which I began.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_076.wav|This fight happened in the United States.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_077.wav|It might have happened and gone in the main unrecorded in Spain or Japan or the Lebanon but it didn't.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_078.wav|It happened here.
wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_079.wav|And coming on top of the dark complexity of Vietnam and the adventure in the Dominican Republic it only fowls up the unpleasant odour in which I'm sorry to say Uncle Sam finds himself everywhere around the world in my observation accepting only in Thailand and Australia.

wavs/cooke_1965-05-30_085.wav|Good night.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_001.wav|good morning about a month ago, a reporter was arrested and sent off to prison.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_002.wav|His sin was that in writing about some flaw or injustice or fiddle in the government, he'd used a confidential source and when the authorities asked him to reveal the source, he refused.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_003.wav|So he was bustled off.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_004.wav|At which point, in-step or considering his shape, barrelled in the top authority, the president, no less, and said rubbish, he has every right to protect his source, release him at once.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_005.wav|The reporter was a Russian and the man who balled out the arresting authorities was Boris Yeltsin, a heartening piece of news for us if ever there was one.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_006.wav|Imagine in a country in which for 70 years to criticize the government openly, without benefit of any other source than your own opinion, was to guarantee yourself a passport to out of Mongolia or to forced labor or to a so-called psychiatric hospital to stay there for months, perhaps years, until it was plain to everybody as a Jew had learned to think correctly about the Soviet Union and all its works.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_007.wav|By the way, it was from the Soviets that we first heard that prim word which has cloked so many layers of shame and hypocrisy.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_008.wav|I remember being first puzzled by it during the dreadful political purge trials of the 1930s, when about 50 of Stalin's old comrades had committed the error of not following Stalin, nimbly enough in switching from the right wing to the left wing of the party.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_009.wav|And suddenly these men who had helped him to achieve the revolution were declared to be victims of incorrect thinking and were consequently executed.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_010.wav|In the founding scripture of the Soviet Union, in its constitution, Article 125, they actually adopted the American phraseology of the Bill of to guarantee what you think.

wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_014.wav|None of your business snaps Mr. Yeltsin and so say all of us.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_015.wav|Or rather, all of us accept the Senate of the United States.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_016.wav|Just about the time the Russian reporter was being packed off to jail.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_017.wav|A young reporter from a Long Island newspaper, Mr. Phelps, was subpoenaed by the Senate Rules Committee and questioned for hours by a special council.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_018.wav|And this week, a young woman, a reporter for the National Public, that's non-commercial radio system, Ms. Tottenberg, was subpoenaed also, and she too was questioned for four hours on the same matter.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_019.wav|Both of them on a day early in October of last year had reported something which the public until then knew nothing about.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_020.wav|Namely, that one Anita Hill, the professor of law at the University of Oklahoma, had made a very serious accusation against Judge Clarence Thomas, a judge of the appeals court who was at that moment coming to the end of hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee on his fitness to fulfill the president's appointment of him to the Supreme Court.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_021.wav|She had accused him, these two reporters said or wrote, of being constantly asked to go out with him when she worked for him at the Education Department, of the Government Commission, that she as constantly refused, and that he recounted details of pornographic films he'd seen, and in other ways sexually harassed her.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_022.wav|The special council appointed by the Senate Rules Committee now wants to know simply where the two reporters got their information, their source.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_023.wav|They both politely refused to tell him, and spent the rest of the hours responding to intermordable questions as the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution allows them to do, I respectfully refuse to answer on the grounds of self-incrimination.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_024.wav|Not many listeners will need to be reminded about the bombshell that this accusation threw into the confirmation hearings of Judge Thomas.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_025.wav|In fact, they were just about over, but the revelation or assertion of those two reporters caused the chairman of the committee to call for a second round to have the judge confront in another public hearing his accuser.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_026.wav|And I don't need to say that for several days the thing was gone into to the vast and ugly titillation of millions of television viewers in more countries than this one.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_027.wav|Now, two questions.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_028.wav|First, if the two reporters were indeed the beneficiaries of a leak, who is the leak, the deep throat, and who wanted to have the leak traced to the point of inviting two reporters to refuse under oath to tell, and so put themselves in contempt of Congress.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_029.wav|Well, the history of how Miss Hill came in the end to be called before the Judiciary Committee is long and torturous, but in spite of the furious conviction on the part of some republic and senators on the committee that one or other of the Democrat members had enticed Miss Hill into going public, there is a straight line, a sequence of events that is not in question and not hard to follow, though the identity of some of the participants is unknown or in dispute.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_030.wav|First, then, during the summer of 1991, when the personal staffs of the senators on the committee were preparing for the hearings, a journalist who had written profiles and other pieces on judge Thomas was approached by some Senate staffer, nevermind who, nothing about Anita Hill surfaced in his testimony.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_031.wav|In August, the lady who belonged to a citizen's group known as the Alliance for Justice got a call from a man, she knew, who had been a classmate of Miss Hill at Yale Law School.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_032.wav|He told the lady that Miss Hill had been sexually harassed by Miss Determus way back.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_033.wav|The lady passed on this charge to the staff of one of the Democrat senators on the committee.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_034.wav|Soon, inevitably the chairman of the committee, Senator Biden, another Democrat, got wind of this and ordered another committee staffer to talk to Miss Hill and have her confirm or deny the charge.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_035.wav|She thought things over and eventually made a sworn statement to a committee staffer.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_036.wav|We really could stop there because it was that statement that the Long Island reporter and the National Public Radio Woman Reporter got a hold of.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_037.wav|How and from whom is what the Senate's special counsel wants to know?
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_038.wav|But I ought to finish off the story because it has been wrongly claimed that what was leaked was Miss Hill's private testimony to the FBI.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_039.wav|Senator Biden, the chairman of the committee, sent Miss Hill's sworn statement to President Bush in the legitimate belief that this matter was serious enough to be looked into by the FBI.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_040.wav|The FBI is the investigating arm of the Department of Justice, which of course is under the President's wing of the government, the executive.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_041.wav|The President or his Attorney General alone can order the FBI to make an investigation, which President Bush did.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_042.wav|Miss Hill agreed then to be interviewed by the FBI and there she made again her charge of sexual harassment.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_043.wav|Pretty much in the form she was later to recite before the committee in the presence of Judge Thomas.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_044.wav|Anyway, it was Miss Hill's sworn statement before a committee staffer that was leaked by somebody to the two subpoenaed reporters.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_045.wav|You'll see that there were many pipelines of rumor and tattling that could have provided a leak.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_046.wav|Second question.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_047.wav|Who insisted on this new investigation, whose only aim is to discover the identity of the leaker?
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_048.wav|The answer is two or three Republican senators, strong supporters of Judge Thomas on the Judiciary Committee, who will live in that Miss Hill's charges ever came to public knowledge and who claimed then and now that Miss Hill was from the beginning a patsy, a setup, a dupe of somebody, probably a staff member of one of the Democrat senators who had gone out early in the summer on a muck-raking expedition to find something damning to Judge Thomas's nomination.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_049.wav|And by a seduous raking, probably they hinted among feminists, liberals and other such mischief makers, had brought up in the sieve this nasty bit of rumor, Oslander or whatever.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_050.wav|Because the two reporters, Mr. Phelps and Mr. Tottenberg were the first people to bring it out in public.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_051.wav|They were brought before the Special Counsel of the Senate Rules Committee, which these Republicans had insisted should be called to investigate.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_052.wav|Now, as I said, the Senate has the power to cite refusing testifiers for contempt of Congress and therefore, Mr. Tottenberg and Mr. Phelps could, once the citation is issued, be sent to jail.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_053.wav|It's extremely unlikely that the Senate dare do that.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_054.wav|In the past 25 years, there have been other cases of journalists refusing to name the leaks who provided, for instance, secret documents from the Pentagon, from the Justice Department, some even protected by government security.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_055.wav|But the courts have steadily maintained that the First Amendment, Freedom of the Press, protects the free flow of information and a reporter's right not to disclose confidential sources.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_056.wav|In this case, Ms. Hill's sworn statement is not by any definition a secret government document, and no crime of any sort is imputed.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_057.wav|If Mr. Phelps and Mr. Tottenberg did get sent to jail, there'd be such a huge national outcry as to turn the gallant or defiant victims into a couple of martyrs.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_058.wav|The vengeful Republicans who started the investigation surely know this and must now be stumped on how to act like stern headmasters and yet do nothing but slap two wrists.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_059.wav|Their plight is sad indeed.
wavs/cooke_1992-02-28_060.wav|They didn't ought to have done it, Dad, because the embarrassing comparison with Mr. Yeltson, which John Chancellor was the first to spot, would be instantly invoked to demonstrate how freedom of the press, one of the glories of the American system, is so much more safely guaranteed in of all places, holy Russia.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_001.wav|good morning.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_002.wav|For many years, I was lucky in guessing that by the time my talk was being heard, the topic would be fresh, if not right on.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_003.wav|You may wonder why there should ever be a problem about this.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_004.wav|Well, the problem haunts the broadcast stuff.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_005.wav|Every time he sits before a microphone, and yet is something that probably never even occurs to most listeners.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_006.wav|The fact is that the spoken word is so topical.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_007.wav|Everybody believes it's being spoken at the moment of hearing.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_008.wav|Even if you know, if you've noticed, the fine print, which says recorded.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_009.wav|Even veteran radio critics are as hypnotized by the medium as five-year-olds.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_010.wav|What they hear is being spoken now, as witness this sad story, which was bound to happen sometime.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_011.wav|And one weekend in the spring of 1961 did.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_012.wav|It was a slack weekend.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_013.wav|In those days I recorded the talk on Friday.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_014.wav|I could see nothing earth-shaking.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_015.wav|Anyway, I'm not a pundit.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_016.wav|There's always something going on around the corner at the grocers or the lunch counter.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_017.wav|Like they do interest more people than, for instance, this weekend, a pronouncement by Mr Kenneth Star, that some of the things that a co-operating witness can do is assist us in consensual monitoring, which we described at a high level of generality.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_018.wav|So.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_019.wav|So there, of course, I have no idea now what I decided to talk about that dull weekend, except to hope it was some quirky or odd or funny thing that would touch some human beings come Sunday morning.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_020.wav|The talk was, as usual, recorded time and package and flown overnight and passed by British customs as non-contraman and non-inflammable.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_021.wav|It was played as usual in those days, first on Sunday evening and then for the larger motor car audience on Monday morning.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_022.wav|It just so happened that for the first time in ages a prominent English radio critic had chosen to review that talk.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_023.wav|Came Sunday morning and by dawn's early light he knew, all the world knew, that the Russians had overnight pulled a fast one on the United States.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_024.wav|They had rocketed, Yuri Alexeiovich Gagarin around the earth, the first human to travel in space.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_025.wav|Of course, I knew it as soon as the critic did.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_026.wav|Did he stop to say, of course, he must have recorded this a day or so ago?
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_027.wav|No, he sat down and wrote with relish.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_028.wav|One thing you must say for cook, when the last, the final bomb has dropped on us all, he'll still be there in New York, waffling away as usual.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_029.wav|This reminiscence is by way of a protective shield against the chance that by the time these words are, as we say, ed, Iraq may be thundering with exploding American and British missiles.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_030.wav|If you know, I'll know, though I ought to say that this time, as I talk, there's every sign that Saddam Hussein may have had a point in having his prime minister say, in, I must say, more pungent English than Mr. Kenneth Star uses, all the documents we have, we have shown you,
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_031.wav|all that we don't have, we don't have, all the documents that don't exist don't exist.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_032.wav|The surrender treaty agreement mentions the right to inspect, quote, arms-related evidence.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_033.wav|A phrase which Mr. Star, I'm sure, would gladly spend several months explaining if that's the word he'd have in mind, which I think it is, if he were ever hired by Saddam Hussein.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_034.wav|But there are two other nasty reasons for withholding the missiles, which give us pause and which I'm sure Saddam always has in mind.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_035.wav|One is, we know what the Iraqi people would be seeing on their television sets the first evening after an air strike.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_036.wav|The veteran Washington commentator Meg Greenfield has put this better than anyone.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_037.wav|There are plenty of critics of the American military who will scoff at the very idea of such squeamishness, citing our introduction of atomic weapons in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War 2, our saturation bombing of Dresden, and a range of brutal actions in Vietnam.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_038.wav|But all that took place a long time ago as these things are measured, and the context of our lives is different now.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_039.wav|We were actively and continuously engaged in combat then for one thing, and for another, everything was not as now visible instantaneously the deaths and the maimings and above all the dying infants and their wailing desolate parents.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_040.wav|Many such pictures have been imprinted on the national consciousness and tug us back from our fighting resolve.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_041.wav|This I believe is very true.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_042.wav|The second more hard-hearted misgiving is one the White House and the Pentagon have been wrestling with literally for years.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_043.wav|When a poll is taken and people are asked if Saddam doesn't allow full inspection should we bomb the forbidden sites or not?
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_044.wav|The question is meaningless, and so therefore is the answer because part of the national consciousness too is a picture of the bombing targets like something as solid and visible as an ammunition dump or a presidential palace.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_045.wav|A true or a question would be how do you attack a test tube or a file of papers describing a poison, both of which are buried somewhere underground in a desert larger than California.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_046.wav|It has already been calculated that to have the luck of destroying even a quarter of the relevant evidence, weapons, research tools, gas tubes, chemicals, the aerial bombing would have to be so abundantly widespread as to cause the massacre of many thousands of children and those despairing mothers.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_047.wav|All seen at once, tonight and every night throughout the world, leaving whatever other impression, a guilty impression of the United States as a heartless monster.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_048.wav|Since the invention of television, I don't know what the answer to this is.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_049.wav|So finally, and now surprisingly being talked openly about by the President, the Secretary of Defense and some of the Congress, is the thought the longed for possibility of overthrowing Saddam and his regime.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_050.wav|And that has brought up a subject that has long been a forbidden phrase in Congress, ground troops, desert storm number two, with certainly no sanction from the United Nations.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_051.wav|Well, whatever has happened, missiles or no missiles, these things will be on the minds of the administration and if it has happened on everybody's mind.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_052.wav|In the meantime, if we've threatened yet another final automaton, what is on the minds of at least half the American population, and that's about the number of Americans who own stocks, is how to explain the all-time record closing figure of the New York Stock Exchange of the Dow Industrials, that is, last Monday.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_053.wav|In July, it seems more like a year ago, we were reveling in the euphoria of a never-ending Clinton prosperity, matching the Coolidge prosperity of the 1920s.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_054.wav|Practically zero inflation, lowest unemployment rate in how many years, 2030, and four times as many people in the stock market, as in the joyous days of Coolidge.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_055.wav|And the market expanding and expanding, or was it just a swelling bubble ready to burst?
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_056.wav|And then dark clouds to spoil our blue skies came drifting in quickly from Japan.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_057.wav|So Japan was not the brilliant dream economy after all.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_058.wav|Worse was to follow the collapse of the economies of other Southeast Asian countries.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_059.wav|Then we had the first warnings that Brazil, the bell weather, of the South American economies, was in grave trouble.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_060.wav|And that gave the first prod to the North American optimists.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_061.wav|By last week, all the talking heads on the financial channel, experts of all kinds who tell us why and what for most of 24 hours a day, they were beginning for the first time to argue.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_062.wav|After several hundred point drops and the market going down from its 9,000 peak into the 7,000s, where we are where we are not sliding down the gattery and slope into at least a valley, if not the pits.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_063.wav|And then came the soaring Roman candle of last Monday, like a dazzling sentence out of tumwolf, bang, flesh, whoosh, up 214, a record close.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_064.wav|Next morning, no later, we had definitive explanations of where the United States now stands, of its prosperity, a better its economy.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_065.wav|I will give you briefly the two extreme views from Mr. Optimist and Mr. Pessimist, though I hope you understand both of them would claim to be objective scientific analysts.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_066.wav|The Optimist, Wall Street panicked this summer, but the sky did not fall.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_067.wav|This week the big stocks hit record highs, even junk bonds show new life.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_068.wav|There is new confidence in corporate takeovers.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_069.wav|Brazil has been bailed out.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_070.wav|Japan is taking promising steps to recovery.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_071.wav|The International Monetary Fund is saving Russia.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_072.wav|These moves and the Federal Reserve's three cuts in interest rates have done the trick.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_073.wav|The pessimist, well, has it.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_074.wav|The whole preceding argument is wishful thinking.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_075.wav|Huge stock increases with no matching earnings make the United States stock market a very risky place indeed.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_076.wav|Consumer credit is at an all-time high and worse household savings have dropped for the first time in 60 years.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_077.wav|In short, the American people cannot go on forever, spending more than they earn.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_078.wav|That is the frightening number of it.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_079.wav|These are very brief drastic summaries of arguments spun out with much impressive if incomprehensible jargon.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_080.wav|It's a happy surprise, therefore, that the more persuasive pessimist's view comes right down to what Mr. McCorber told young David Copperfield.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_081.wav|Annual income of 20 pounds annual expenditure 19, 19 and six result happiness.
wavs/cooke_1998-11-27_082.wav|Annual income of 20 pounds annual expenditure 20 pounds no shillings and six months result misery.

wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_002.wav|The bus driver must deliver his bus to its terminus, the cashier tuts up the receipts, the steel worker manks the furnaces, the nurse checks the restless patient in room 32 and taxi men or if he's a pest, gives him a knockout drop.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_003.wav|Well, journalists, commentators recognize at the end of every year a peculiar responsibility.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_004.wav|In hundreds of thousands of newspaper offices and television and radio stations around the world, men and women sat down sometime during this past week and without a second thought did what was expected of them.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_005.wav|It's the without a second thought that bothers me.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_006.wav|What they're expected to do is to survey the events of the year.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_007.wav|This we say was what happened.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_008.wav|This is the way it added up.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_009.wav|We then go home in the satisfaction of a job well done and settle down to a drink, a meal, a game, or in this day and age to a gorping vigil before the telly to watch their survey and see how they made it all add up.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_010.wav|What bothers me is not that we may look at things differently but the assumption we all make that any given year is a complete chapter of human history.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_011.wav|After all, it was we, not God, who invented 365 days as a unit of time or history and history like God moves in mysterious ways.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_012.wav|Historians know this better than journalists and they've developed their own superior form of hindsight.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_013.wav|They have a favorite image.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_014.wav|It's that of a mountain range which forms a watershed for the rivers, the rains, the melting snows, to fall one way or the other.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_015.wav|I remember an ambassador posted to Washington before he made the leap into diplomacy.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_016.wav|He was a university professor.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_017.wav|He got the reputation of being a very wise man because anyone who called on him was told that what happened last week was not really important in itself.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_018.wav|Something that happened nine months or maybe even two years ago, that was the watershed.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_019.wav|I was myself very impressed by this man until I got to know him well.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_020.wav|Every time I went down to Washington and called on him, I found that he'd discovered a new watershed.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_021.wav|After some dramatic thing had happened in Washington or Moscow or Greece or China or wherever, he'd say, this is not really important.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_022.wav|The real watershed was Hiroshima.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_023.wav|Remembering this, I look over 1981 and wonder whether the new age of terrorism really began with the attacks on President Reagan and the Pope or whether it wasn't announced by the shots that killed the Kennedy brothers or before.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_024.wav|Of one thing only, I'm pretty sure.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_025.wav|The American decision to watch and if you like police, the Middle East, as a region vital to American, to Western security, was not made by Mr. Reagan and he shouldn't be blamed or applauded for it.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_026.wav|25 years ago, on the last day of December 1956, Eisenhower's Secretary of State Mr. John Foster Dalley, announced what was to become known as the Eisenhower doctrine.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_027.wav|It was headlined everywhere as a new American policy.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_028.wav|This is the gist of what he said.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_029.wav|From now on, the United States will have to accept an increasing responsibility to assist the free nations of the Middle East, to maintain their freedom and develop their welfare, to help prevent the spread of Soviet imperialism.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_030.wav|To an area within whose orbit are the shrines of three great religions, the future is not without its dangers from Russia's rulers, who still seek success in the Middle East, where Soviet propaganda vigorously offers communism to those who want freedom and well-being.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_031.wav|Well, Mr. Dalley was accused of saber-attling as Mr. Reagan is, but people didn't get scared then about the possibility of war because then America had a tremendous edge in nuclear power, and we can now see the idea that the Arabs would deny to us or could be made to deny to us the oil that is vital to our industry, to our civilization, had simply not occurred to anybody, so far as I know.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_032.wav|I'd better say that in the middle 1960s, I'd been in the Middle East and was amazed at the range and power of Russian penetration by way of technical and military advisers, engineers, radio propaganda in many languages, easily drowning out the BBC's overseas services, the Chinese, by the way, broadcast there and in Africa in even more languages and dialects than the Russians.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_033.wav|It occurred to me then that if things went along as successfully as they were doing for them, the Russians wouldn't need their land armies or their navy, not to use directly against Western Europe.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_034.wav|If the day came when the Russians had managed to be stride the Mediterranean and exert a strangling grip on the oil fields of the Middle East, they would be able to say to Germany, France, Britain, Scandinavia, well now do you want your daily oil or don't you and go on to say, as they did after the Second War to Poland, we'd be obliged to you if you'd get yourselves the kind of government of which we can approve.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_035.wav|This request or ultimatum, whichever you want to call it, caused the first terrific route, the United Nations, which was just then being born in San Francisco.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_036.wav|The Polish delegation chosen to represent Poland at San Francisco was abandoned and a puppet delegation approved by the Russians arrived.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_037.wav|Ever since Poland has been as we all know, a Russian satellite.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_038.wav|So maybe the 1945 rau over the Lublin government, which the Russians won, was the fatal day, the watershed for Poland.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_039.wav|Against which the tragic heroics of Lech Valensse and Solidarity 35 years later were a doomed protest.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_040.wav|At any rate the Reagan doctrine is not just a repeat performance of the Eisenhower doctrine.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_041.wav|The oil we live by is the new and a cursid issue.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_042.wav|And our dire need of it is what makes the present American administration reassert its concern for the Middle East.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_043.wav|My seven year old nightmare is ever present to the men and women on the Middle East and desk of the State Department.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_044.wav|It's not a vision of Soviet arm is pouring across Europe to the English Channel and beyond.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_045.wav|It's the thought of the Soviet Union being able to convert Western Europe into a satellite without a shot being fired.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_046.wav|Well, I've been reading through exhaustive summaries in several American magazines and newspapers of the events, foreign and domestic of 1981.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_047.wav|And I'm not going to go into them for the simple reason that when you put them all together, what you've created is not the truth about 1981.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_048.wav|But what amounts to a patchwork, only parts of which will mean much to any one of us?
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_049.wav|In my favorite bed book, the nine volumes of James Ager's diaries called Ego, he makes what seems to me to be an essential distinction.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_050.wav|When the volume that covered the first year of the Second World War was published, Ager was criticized, more he was abused by his scandalized colleagues, for putting down in his diary his complaints about his asthma or a bad performance of Macbeth, when he ought to have been writing about Hitler's broadcasts or the evacuation from Dunkirk.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_051.wav|He defended himself by writing later that Hitler and the evacuation from Dunkirk were vital to all of us, but not important to him.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_052.wav|And when the great day came of victory in Europe, Ager didn't join the crowd cheering outside Buckingham Palace.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_053.wav|He wrote a furious letter to the Times, protesting against the triviality of the music being played on the radio.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_054.wav|It was a time he wrote when we ought to have transmitted on VE Day a magnificent blast of Beethoven and Bach, the best of Germany, in the moment that we saw the worst go groveling in the dust.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_055.wav|I'm sure he was right in this, at least in this distinction between what is vital and what is important to any one of us.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_056.wav|I suppose if I were challenged to do it, I could sit down and write a 20,000-word essay, a summary of the main progress of the Second World War, which I read about and covered and lived through.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_057.wav|But if you were to ask me now what I remember instantly, what was most vivid, I should have to say, the memory of the head of the British military mission in Washington, a very able general, who when America came in and instituted petrol rationing, went to the appropriate board to be issued a proper ration.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_058.wav|America did not conduct rationing through ad hoc local boards.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_059.wav|It got out and elaborate but inflexible list of requirements for anybody who claimed more than a minimum ration.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_060.wav|The general was asked, are you a doctor? Do you carry coal or ice?
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_061.wav|Do you deliver children to school?
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_062.wav|Are you disabled?
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_063.wav|He was, he did, none of these things, application denied.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_064.wav|It required the intervention of Winston Churchill to get him his petrol.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_065.wav|Or the night in Seattle when I ran into a clutch of happy munitions workers, the women with orchids pinned to their blouses, sitting up at a bar and living it up on high war workers' wages.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_066.wav|Well said one of them didn't grow so well say he wanted Americans to enjoy the more abundant life.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_067.wav|Or the terrible dilemma of a sailor I ran into in Pittsburgh who was going off to the Pacific and wanted to marry his girl.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_068.wav|His family was Polish, hers was Czech and in Pittsburgh in those days Poles did not marry Czechs.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_069.wav|This terrible family feud was far more important to him than the vital need to beat the Japanese in the Pacific.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_070.wav|And it surely so for any and all of us.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_071.wav|For all of us this is the sad year of the Pope and President Sadat, unlike Valenza.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_072.wav|And the happy festival year of the Princeton Princess of Wales.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_073.wav|But to you it's the year you lost your wife or met your girl or lost a job or got a job.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_074.wav|So let me wish you in 1982 less grief and more contentment the things that are most important to most of us and leave you only with one bit of advice.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_075.wav|If you're old enough to retire and are about to do so don't do it.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_076.wav|Men especially men who retire, heal over or they go hard in the arteries and soft in the head and become a nuisance around the house.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_077.wav|So I wish you most a healthy and active and restless and inquisitive new year.
wavs/cooke_1982-01-01_078.wav|Happiness will follow.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_001.wav|a few years ago, maybe five, ten, anyway, it was in the summer of 1931.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_002.wav|I ordered a record from the local gramophone shop and it took an awful long time to be delivered.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_003.wav|When at last it did arrive, I hustled it onto the turntable.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_004.wav|My mother was intrigued by its title, which she thought odd, not to say gruesome.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_005.wav|It was called the St. James infirmary.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_006.wav|It began with a shattering cord and a trumpet taking off like a supersonic jet.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_007.wav|Long before it was over, I took it off the machine because I saw that my mother was sitting there in tears.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_008.wav|She was not moved by the beauty of the piece or the artistry of the mad trumpeter.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_009.wav|She was frightened by it and a gasped that her son could listen to this jungle band without a blush.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_010.wav|To her in those remote days, it was as if today a mother had seen her son nonchalantly take out a needle and give himself a shot of heroin.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_011.wav|I don't suppose there is a generation left now that hates jazz, simply as such, even the flappers of the 1920s who doted on the new fan of jazz are now in their 70s.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_012.wav|But in my youth, it was the normal thing for people over 50 to be either frightened of jazz or contemptuous of it.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_013.wav|Old soldiers, doctors, schoolmasters and other establishment figures made a point of equating the word jazz with the adjectives, negroid and decadent.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_014.wav|And English magistrates rarely missed an opportunity to ascribe petty thievery and illegitimate births to the fearful influence of the saxophone.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_015.wav|Now my mother was too simple, too unpretentious a person to be contemptuous of jazz.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_016.wav|It simply scared the wits out of her.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_017.wav|Well, I was young and calo, but also I like to think responsive to all sorts of music from Mozart to Sullivan, both Arthur and Joe, not to mention Maxine.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_018.wav|And I was frankly exhilarated by this record and mesmerized by its solo trumpet.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_019.wav|I took the record back to college and never again bootlegged it into our house.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_020.wav|Even so, I should never have expected that when that solo trumpet had died, the New York Times would bow to him editorially as an authentic American folk hero, a legend in his time, or that the austere guardian of Manchester, which is now, as you know, the guardian of all England, would salute him as a great and noble artist who served the world and his people well.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_021.wav|Louis Armstrong died last Tuesday, two days after his 71st birthday.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_022.wav|On Friday, they buried him and among the poor bearers with a governor of New York State, Mayor Lindsay Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald Duke Ellington Count Basie, Bobby Hackett, Pearl Bailey, and Frank Sinatra.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_023.wav|There's no point in trying now to solve the insoluble problem of taste and fashion, though it is a problem that faces every generation and every true artist and every fake.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_024.wav|After all, Stravinsky's Rights of Spring, when it was first performed, produced a riot in Paris, and at one time the musical world was torn apart by the question of whether Wagner was a genius or a barbarian.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_025.wav|Forty years ago, the death of Louis Armstrong would have received about the same notice in the Daily Press, as in that year of 1931, the death of Bix Bydebeck did receive, which is to say no mention at all.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_026.wav|Yet Bydebeck was the first white jazz musician whom Armstrong, a man of well-developed ego, embraced as a brother genius.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_027.wav|It seems incredible now that anybody who's taste in music takes in, say, Ravel and Delius should not recognize in the lovely melancholic connet of Bydebeck one of the unique and enduring sounds in jazz.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_028.wav|I have collected Armstrong since he did a series of improvisations in I think 1927 with the father of jazz piano, Earl Hines, who happily still lives, and is still the incomparable master.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_029.wav|But when I got the news of Armstrong's death, maybe it was the memory of that rare first complement to a white jazz man, which moved me to get out an old whiteman record.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_030.wav|One of the precious batch recorded over a single winter and spring, which redeemed whiteman's lush commercialism by giving rain to the sad, firm arrangements of Bill Chalice and to a marvelous strutting trio of true jazz men, Bydebeck, Tromba and Bill Rank.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_031.wav|And I played Bix's lovely solo of Lone Limelody and somehow felt that Bydebeck had transcended and refined Armstrong's original inventions.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_032.wav|But Bydebeck died 40 years ago and never achieved the New York Times.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_033.wav|Armstrong was more than a music man.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_034.wav|He was an American folk original and he epitomizes and files away once for all a kind of black man's life in the south that will not, I think, happen again.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_035.wav|One of the fine things about him is that unlike many a poor and shifty boy, he neither glossed over his squalid origins, nor, which is harder, did he in the years of his success boast about them.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_036.wav|He was born to a father who stoked furnaces in a turpentine factory and who left his wife when Armstrong was an infant.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_037.wav|From the age of six on Armstrong lived with his mother in a ratty colored section of New Orleans, given over to gambler's pimps and prostitutes cribs.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_038.wav|Whether Armstrong once said, whether my mother did any hustling, I can't say if she did, she kept it out of sight.

wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_040.wav|Young Louis was out on the streets by day, delivering coal to prostitutes cribs, picking up his meals from garbage cans and by night hanging around the early honkytunks.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_041.wav|He used to say that the greatest thing that ever happened to me was being arrested and sent off to a Wafes home on New Year's Day 1914.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_042.wav|He had celebrated the New Year by stealing a 38-calibre pistol from one of the stepdaddies and running out on the street and firing it.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_043.wav|In the Wafes home there was a poor teacher, a colored man, who taught him to play a bugle and a coin it.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_044.wav|He got to play with the home man at funerals and when he came out he sold some more coal to make money to lose by night in the gambling houses.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_045.wav|In two hours man he said I was a broke cat, broker than the ten commandments.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_046.wav|He tried pimping for a while, he got a stab wound in the shoulder and when he was 18 he married a prostitute.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_047.wav|It didn't last, he explained a couple of years ago, for a simple reason she wouldn't give up her line of work.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_048.wav|A year later he joined a ragtime band and then graduated to a riverboat band and he began to blast himself to fame among the early black musicians so that he was sent for by the great king Oliver.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_049.wav|He went to Chicago and the rest is history, the rest being the simple crucial fact that he moved in on a kind of music which was improvised ensemble work and he cut through it like a knife through butter by creating the jazz soloist in his own person.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_050.wav|For the next 45 years jazz developed and waned and grew again simple and complicated but always along the path that Armstrong blazed with his remarkable lungs and his even more remarkable musical imagination.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_051.wav|Recently as with all black men of any sort of talent Armstrong has come to be judged not so much by his music as by his social attitudes as a successful Negro.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_052.wav|A fierce moral test to which by the way we don't equally subject successful whites was he or was he not an Uncle Tom.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_053.wav|Well in his early film appearances he was a standard variation of Uncle Tom, cousin Tom if you like, the stereotype of the jolly, rogish city Negro as step in fetch it was the more disreputable stereotype of the shiftless, witness country Negro.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_054.wav|I don't know whether Armstrong fretted over this he was I suspect much too independent, too blind to change his character at 65.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_055.wav|He knew he'd been lucky, he was adored by all but the most politically conscious blacks and whites, he could have moved to one of the expensive enclaves in Harlem or like many a black basketball or baseball player of late, he could have bought some acres in very leafy suburbia and built a small mansion but through all his fame and wealth he stayed in the comfortable humdrum house in a lower middle class section of a New York borough and he died there.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_056.wav|In 1965 though he recoiled in public from the police beatings in Selma, Alabama, he summed up his attitude quite crisply, they'd beat Jesus if he was black and marched, I'm not in the front line but I support them with my donations, my life is music, they would beat me on the mouth if I marched and without my mouth I wouldn't be able to blow my horn.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_057.wav|He certainly was never blind to the strict moris of his hometown New Orleans which today wallows in its true reputation as the cradle of jazz but does not in the publicity mention how very lately Negroes have played in public there.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_058.wav|The blacks brewed jazz in the hallhouses on sour pianos 50 and 60 years ago and when jazz broke loose from its smelly origins the boys with talent broke out of the south too and wound up in the glory days in Chicago and New York.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_059.wav|Armstrong refused ever to play New Orleans until the Civil Rights Act was passed and in 1965 he went back and he led an integrated band in the new jazz museum down there.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_060.wav|It is a riot touch that this hallowed hall which today tourists visit as they might patter into the Louvre was built around the crumbling timber of a wretched shack in which on the 4th of July 1900 Armstrong was born.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_061.wav|Even the Soviets have changed their mind about him.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_062.wav|When he made the first of several triumphant tours of Africa Moscow officially dubbed him a lackey helping in a capitalist distraction.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_063.wav|He had to reply for that.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_064.wav|I'm African descended down to the bone from my grandmemi on my mami side and from my grandpappy on my pappy side.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_065.wav|Last Wednesday Moscow gave us permission to think of Armstrong as an okay figure.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_066.wav|A symbol said his vestia of the best traditions of Negro classical jazz.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_067.wav|The huge talent of this musician his love of work and loyalty to his people enabled him to penetrate the impregnable barrier of racism in the USA and to achieve worldwide recognition.
wavs/cooke_1971-06-12_068.wav|So now it's official.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_001.wav|good morning and wonder what it must be like to be well even called the most powerful man in the world so that you have to think three times before opening your mouth in public.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_002.wav|Once the man I have in mind was getting into his golfing togs when his partner arrived in the locker room and said, how are you?
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_003.wav|only half ingest he replied, I'm not allowed to say.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_004.wav|Of course the question of who among the world's titans is the most powerful would involve us in tiresome wrangles about defining power and greatness and in no time somebody would be voting for the president of china against say, ruptured mardock.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_005.wav|Let's have a little guessing game about his identity from these clues.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_006.wav|He's slim, medium height, 71 years old.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_007.wav|He can be said according to your taste in cruelty to have thinning hair or be bald.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_008.wav|He wears always everywhere, maybe to bed, a dark suit, a nondescript dark tie, loafers.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_009.wav|We, we the people rarely see him walking or standing up.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_010.wav|We always see him sitting down bent over testifying before a committee of congress.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_011.wav|Reading a text, he's too cautious to improvise.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_012.wav|He has thick, not quite beer bottle glasses and long curling half moon of a mouth.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_013.wav|He looks in fact like an amiable sleepy elf in an old Disney movie.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_014.wav|Not by a mile what central casting would look for to play the most powerful man in the world.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_015.wav|His name is Alan Greenspan.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_016.wav|He is the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, an appointment that is at the disposal of the president of the United States.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_017.wav|But once appointed he is beholden to nobody.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_018.wav|The last time I was in London, an old friend of mine, whom anybody would call educated said,
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_019.wav|We're always hearing about the Federal Reserve.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_020.wav|What exactly is it?
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_021.wav|I could have short circuited a long, difficult explanation by saying, he's the man who decides what you're going to pay for a bank loan, or for a cotton of milk next time you go shopping.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_022.wav|Well, let's say as briefly as possible without oversimplifying how it came about, and what it does.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_023.wav|Just 90 years ago there was a panic in the world of banking and business, a world that was run in this country by what they called the trusts.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_024.wav|Combinations of companies in the same business, the oil trust, the railroad trust, the sugar trust, each run by a board of trustees that well eliminated competition and controlled the national market.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_025.wav|The government was a majestic but helpless onlooker until the 1907 panic.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_026.wav|When it came out that the sugar trust had swindled the government out of millions of dollars in customs duties, the president, Theodore Roosevelt, lashed out at the trusts as no previous president had done.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_027.wav|In a famous speech, a frightening speech to the men who had sent him to Washington because he was too much of a reformer, and a nuisance as governor of New York.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_028.wav|Roosevelt attributed the panic to the speculative, folly and flagrant dishonesty of a few men of great wealth.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_029.wav|When Teddy Roosevelt denounced anybody or anything, he didn't leave it at that.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_030.wav|He did something.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_031.wav|He asked for laws that would enforce the performance of duty by the man of property towards the man who works for him, by the cooperation towards the investor, the wayjourner, and the general public.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_032.wav|But there were good trusts as well as bad, and most trusts were so cunningly set up, if not in broad daylight, at least in the twilight zone of the law, that the trusts and their lawyers defeated Teddy Roosevelt.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_033.wav|But he appointed a commission to investigate banking practices, and eventually, six years later, there was created something called the Federal Reserve System.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_034.wav|It set up in the beginning eight federal regional banks, acting as central banks for their part of the country.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_035.wav|A board in Washington of seven members that could dictate the reserves, the regional banks must maintain against their deposits.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_036.wav|The board has many powers, but there is one which affects everybody in the country, not to mention lots of companies and shopkeepers and workers, even overseas.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_037.wav|The chairman of the Federal Reserve alone, no president, Senator Congressman, not even the secretary of the Treasury.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_038.wav|He alone can decide the interest rate that the regional banks can charge their borrowers.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_039.wav|And of course, any change in their rate is soon passed on to everybody from the regular banks to a man buying a car, a family with a house mortgage.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_040.wav|Since Alan Greenspan has been in the chair, so to speak, it seems to most of us that his great aim, this passion, has been to save the country from the demon inflation.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_041.wav|There has been miraculously little inflation for the past five, six years.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_042.wav|But four, six years, Mr Clinton likes to say only since he came into the White House, the American economy has been roaring along under full steam.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_043.wav|And when that happens for long, the experience has been low unemployment, higher wages, increased demand for everything, more spending by everybody, more confident borrowing, and inevitably a rising tide of inflation.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_044.wav|Mr Greenspan is credited on account of his hawk-like attention to the money markets, with keeping interest rates low and somehow stifling inflation.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_045.wav|So all he has to do to scare the markets and terrify the stock exchange is, quite frankly, to fall out of his professional jargon and fall into the English language.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_046.wav|He never holds a press conference, he won't be interviewed.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_047.wav|He does from time to in frequent time make a speech.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_048.wav|He made one last December.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_049.wav|So abstract and dense is Mr Greenspan's public language that I don't believe anybody at that dinner speech could possibly recall a sentence.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_050.wav|But everybody could recall two little words.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_051.wav|He suggested that Wall Street might possibly be enjoying a little irrational exuberance.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_052.wav|Next day, the industrial average on the New York Stock Exchange fell 166 points.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_053.wav|No one to his, as he says, not allowed to tell us how he's feeling.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_054.wav|Apparently he's been obsessed with numbers since he could toggle, being shown off to astonished friends by his mother when he could juggle two sets of three digit numbers in his mind.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_055.wav|I have to say when I first heard this, I must have been the only reader who was not impressed.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_056.wav|When I was about ten, the last buried in school on Friday afternoons was supposed to be a rest from work.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_057.wav|Play a little game.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_058.wav|Children, ready boys? Said the lady.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_059.wav|All my teachers were female.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_060.wav|All the men were often flanders.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_061.wav|All Mr Potamia.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_062.wav|I buy two loaves for seven pence each.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_063.wav|I give the grocer half a crown.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_064.wav|Triple the amount of change he gives me.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_065.wav|I tell you, doing mental arithmetic with LSD, which I rushed to say meant pound, shillings and pence, was quite a tough game.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_066.wav|But it did make the decimal system when you encountered it a piece of cake.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_067.wav|However, unlike most of his countrymen and women that I know, Alan Greenspan was a whisked kid at figures.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_068.wav|And some perceptive uncle is bound to have said at one time,
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_069.wav|Alan, when you grow up, if you go on like this, you'll get to be chairman of the Federal Reserve.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_070.wav|Well, so he did, so he is.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_071.wav|And so, acutely aware, he has to be of his huge undefined power over the money markets and every business and person that depends on them.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_072.wav|That the sort of English he uses before congressional committees is like this.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_073.wav|This is an actual passage from his testimony.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_074.wav|The arguments over the issue of how money standard have mirrored the deliberations on the man in which we have chosen to govern ourselves and perhaps more fundamentally debates on the basic values that should govern our society.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_075.wav|A friend who won the Nobel Prize in Economics says admiringly he has mastered the art of meaningless verbiage.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_076.wav|So why should he now come out of the twilight into the open?
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_077.wav|Why are we talking about him?
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_078.wav|Because on Wednesday morning last, he made headlines, even the New York Times, gave him one of its rare two column headlines.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_079.wav|Federal Reserve lifts a key rate.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_080.wav|First rise since 1995.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_081.wav|What had he done?
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_082.wav|He raised the rate of interest on overnight loans between banks by one quarter of one percent.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_083.wav|It was a stone dropped in the pond, a very small stone, but it will cause ripples nonetheless.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_084.wav|Apart from the increases that are inevitable on goods and services, there will be lots of institutions that will express concern for their own solvency.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_085.wav|And sending you a note of regret will tell you they've been forced to put up their prices, the airfare rates say.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_086.wav|And how about the percentage charged on your credit card debt?
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_087.wav|Credit card companies live by the delinquency of their customers, and much to the delight and the prosperity of the credit card companies.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_088.wav|The average American family today owes them at the end of each year $3,500.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_089.wav|By the way, there are one or two other things about Alan Greenspan.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_090.wav|I could have mentioned he's left-handed.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_091.wav|He plays a fair game of tennis.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_092.wav|He's crazy about baseball, numbers again.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_093.wav|Golf, no man, should be required to declare in public the quality of his golf game.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_094.wav|The only person I know who is about 25 handicapped, yet made a point of including in her biography of the phrase, expert cook and golfer.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_095.wav|Is a movie star whose great acting specialty was playing delicate, beautiful, sensitive English roses.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_096.wav|In life, she was a tough, thigh-slapping comic.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_097.wav|As for Alan Greenspan, he went to the Juilliard Music School.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_098.wav|He played as a young man for two years, clarinet and tennis exophone, and a jazz band.
wavs/cooke_1997-03-28_099.wav|I didn't mention these things because I knew that if I had, you'd have spotted him right away.
wavs/cooke_1947-01-12_001.wav|good evening.
wavs/cooke_1947-01-12_002.wav|In the year after the dropping of the first atomic bomb, it's very hard to pretend that the new year is the turning point of anything very serious.
wavs/cooke_1947-01-12_003.wav|But Americans more than most people I think like to enjoy the fallacy of free will and pretend that a new calendar means a new and better life.
wavs/cooke_1947-01-12_004.wav|It's just possible this time that history may give a boost to this old illusion.
wavs/cooke_1947-01-12_005.wav|For what would strike a stranger about the 80th Congress that has met this week, is not so much the personalities and the political program involved, so much as the hopes that Americans are sinking in it.
wavs/cooke_1947-01-12_006.wav|Even a man who couldn't read could have learned something this week from the rash of cartoons in the newspapers.
wavs/cooke_1947-01-12_007.wav|From most of them I think he would have got the notion that Americans are hoping against their own misgivings, that a Republican Congress can prove that capitalism, or more respectively it's called free enterprise, is still the white knight who will rescue a distracted Columbia from the seductive and brutal passes of other systems of economy and government.
wavs/cooke_1947-01-12_008.wav|There's a mythical devotion in all this which I can best explain this way.
wavs/cooke_1947-01-12_009.wav|Halfway down Long Island there's a fish store where I stop in summer.
wavs/cooke_1947-01-12_010.wav|The moment you open the door and go inside the air is pungent with the tang of clams and fat lobsters and writhing crabs and the glass cases that lie between the counter and the sawdust floor gleam with great slabs of swordfish and the steady gaze of striped bass.
wavs/cooke_1947-01-12_011.wav|But if you take a child in there, though he may exchange a suspicious glance or two with a staring bluefish, the thing he notices right away is a picture on the wall that dominates the whole place.
wavs/cooke_1947-01-12_012.wav|It's a very fancy colored print, about three feet long, of a desperate battle between Indians and whites.
wavs/cooke_1947-01-12_013.wav|It's a highly fanciful version in fact of the last pitch battle between them in the United States, only 70 years ago, out in Montana on the plains by the little big horn river.
wavs/cooke_1947-01-12_014.wav|Scalping and knifeing are drawn with the greatest zest, but while everybody else is fainting and shooting and scurrying his neighbor, there stands in the middle a noble soldier with a goatee beard.
wavs/cooke_1947-01-12_015.wav|He is flowed in white, a brave, not to say forgetful figure, quite untouched by the bullets in the blood, measuring his height against an American flag.
wavs/cooke_1947-01-12_016.wav|He is the immortal character, whose real character, few Americans bother to know about, known as Custer, Colonel Custer, who in one of the most stupid blunders in military history managed to go down in the massacre of his entire regiment.
wavs/cooke_1947-01-12_017.wav|However, Custer's last stand is an event and a phrase that American boys learn about as soon as they start to chew gum.
wavs/cooke_1947-01-12_018.wav|And though you can kid about him, it's as well not to make contemptuous remarks even at this late date about Custer himself.
wavs/cooke_1947-01-12_019.wav|The emotion that Americans bring to this picture, whether it's in this fish store or in the mind's eye, is much like that they bring to such phrases as democratic capitalism and a free economy.
wavs/cooke_1947-01-12_020.wav|And the heart of Americans goes out this week to the new Congress, whether their head goes along or not.
wavs/cooke_1947-01-12_021.wav|For there's a sort of secret understanding in the air, which nobody cares to say out loud, that we have taken up our position and are going to try and maintain capitalism's last stand.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_001.wav|good morning, let me throw us back to a date and an event, only a quarter of a century ago, that shocked Europe and America like nothing since, say the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, that brought the United States into the Second World War.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_002.wav|It was a current announcement from the President Nixon was going to China.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_003.wav|At that time, it was about a startling, as if right after the disaster of Dunkirk, we'd heard that Mr. Churchill was going to pay a courtesy call on Hitler.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_004.wav|Mr. Nixon had climbed into the presidency mainly because he'd campaigned all his political life against communists and communism.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_005.wav|He first got into the house and then into the Senate by defeating liberal candidates he attacked as being soft on communism.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_006.wav|He came to national fame for tracking down a Soviets by in the State Department and from then on ranged to the country, asserting that Harry Truman's administration was riddled with communists from top to bottom.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_007.wav|That charge that gave Mr. Truman what he called, conniption fits and a stream of abusive epithets about Mr. Nixon, that in modern times one politician has rarely used against another.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_008.wav|When he got into the White House, President Nixon, though, was realistic enough to know that just huffing and puffing against the Soviet Union was no sort of policy for the only other superpower.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_009.wav|He began to make up to her.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_010.wav|But China was another matter, a remote, potentially dangerous superpower of a billion people, perhaps thinking of developing nuclear power as society just as totalitarian in the treatment of its people as the Soviets.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_011.wav|We were prepared for Mr. Nixon's visit by three evenings of television, of a sort of documentary tour of China, which of course had been vetted by the Chinese.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_012.wav|It confirmed our worst suspicions of what lay outside these uniformly pretty pictures of the charm, the simplicity, the amounting joy and innocence of life among the 800 million people.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_013.wav|The last charming ceremony prepared for Mr. Nixon was a group of eight-year-old Chinese children performing a military dance in which they stabbed the air with fixed bandits.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_014.wav|What we got out of these elaborate, in-tourist travel logs was the impression that there must have been off the beaten track of the official guides a very great deal to hide.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_015.wav|Why people here asked, why should the great communist hunter go to China?
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_016.wav|Because Mr. Nixon, with the encouragement of his secretary of state Mr. Henry Kissinger, began to think of China no longer as a remote nasty enemy, but as a sleeping giant of nearly a billion people with a promising economy, hints of a nuclear program, and most of all not to be thought of as an implacable enemy of the Soviet Union.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_017.wav|Mr. Nixon, in fact, beyond all previous presidents saw into a likely future of China as a country likely to conclude a pact with the Soviets as unthinkable as the Hitler's Stalin pact that guaranteed the Second World War.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_018.wav|Nixon, we didn't realise till later, was going to China to attempt the improbable balancing act of starting a new, friendly diplomatic relationship with China, and at the same time, easing the prolonged tension with the Soviet Union by proposing in Moscow only a month later the first agreement to limit strategic nuclear weapons.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_019.wav|Well because of Mr. Nixon's later disgrace, it's a little late in the day to admit that he and secretary Kissinger succeeded brilliantly and may be credited with the start of the long defrosting of the Cold War.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_020.wav|Now there's no great surprise about President Clinton's mission to China.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_021.wav|Only in the past month one very pressing reason has appeared, which is the rather urgent American wish to help the Chinese economy stay strong and not get caught up in the wash if the Japanese economy found us.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_022.wav|This is such a new thought that only a few months ago the best fiscal minds in Wall Street or Washington would have laughed themselves silly at the mention of it.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_023.wav|It's only such a very short time ago that we'd come to think of Japan as the mighty economic power of the far east.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_024.wav|We're still getting used to the truth of Japan seeing as a rather desperately weak economy.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_025.wav|There are many other good if not so urgent reasons.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_026.wav|China is now a full blown nuclear manufacturing power and possesses missiles targeted on United States cities.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_027.wav|Washington has only likely confirmed that China delivered a whole shipment of equipped nuclear missiles to Pakistan.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_028.wav|This would be disturbing anytime but is a naughty problem indeed just when the sale of high technology equipment has become such a big item in American trade with China so much so that the scanning or monitoring of it has been transferred from the State Department to the Commerce Department.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_029.wav|Some of the President's critics say the first class blunder.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_030.wav|The United States has a trade imbalance with China of $40 billion in China's favor.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_031.wav|Now of course China has its own plans and anxieties to willed grievances.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_032.wav|It keeps objecting to the existence of the official US government radio program in Chinese, the voice of America in Asia.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_033.wav|The Communist countries of Europe always kept up a row about the voice of America in Europe broadcast in many languages on the same grounds as the Chinese.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_034.wav|That it constitutes foreign interference in a nation's internal affairs.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_035.wav|China's more serious grievance is about the treaty America has with the island of Taiwan.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_036.wav|To respect it as a separate China a treaty which carries the implication.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_037.wav|If not the direct threat of armed intervention if mainland communist China moves to invade and take it over.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_038.wav|This has been the big bone of contention with China since it became a communist nation in 1949.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_039.wav|So there are many serious things to discuss between the number one superpower and what now begins to look like the coming number two.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_040.wav|How far and candidly they will be discussed is something we may never know.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_041.wav|But the President has been persuasive enough in various little speeches and in his weekly radio address to have a solid majority of Americans approve of his visit.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_042.wav|One thing that's helped a great deal I think is the television films we've seen the preparatory tours of the new China that have been done by half a dozen different networks, little documentaries, very different from the ones that prepared us 26 years ago for Nixon's visit.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_043.wav|The syrupy source about the total joy of the populace and their wild enthusiasm for their form of government the only one most of them had known.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_044.wav|This time it was clear much of the film shot had not been censored.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_045.wav|We saw quite a bit of the poverty of the rural millions remarking wistfully that the reported prosperity of the cities had passed them by.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_046.wav|One anchorman talked in Tiananmen Square with a young dissident who wanted to present an official a petition for redress of grievances to soldiers approach, brushed him off and told him to get lost.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_047.wav|Its progress of a kind.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_048.wav|We saw a great deal of the living symbols of the new economy that is wrangling, often ignoring the old sacred doctrine on trapriners of many kinds, several interesting millionaires.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_049.wav|And one unforgettable scene, a young woman, a prosperous real estate agent who had torn down government buildings, the government couldn't afford to keep up and built condominiums.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_050.wav|She said the lifeline to her wealth and the new comfort of her tenants was a western novelty they'd never heard of before, the idea of the mortgage.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_051.wav|There is one snag to the success of the mission.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_052.wav|The insistence of some people that this visit is about nothing but China's flouting of human rights.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_053.wav|To some indeed to many public men and women in the United States, the only point of the president's mission is to stand in Tiananmen Square and lecture the Chinese about the shame and brutality of the infamous massacre nine years ago.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_054.wav|Well by now you will know what the president did about it.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_055.wav|It must have been an excruciating decision which every way he wanted to play it a true dilemma.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_056.wav|While we, the papers, the tube on practically all its channels, has been consumed with the China trip domestically.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_057.wav|There have just been issued three thundering decisions of the Supreme Court, Too Late for a sensible comment.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_058.wav|And there is the appalling plight of the state of Florida, hit by a heat wave which down there in summer means daily temperatures well over a hundred degrees coming at the end of the longest drought in 50 years.

wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_066.wav|There is a very small town there called Republic which grows fruits and vegetables until now has gone about its business without scandal or publicity.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_067.wav|Like most other cities, towns, it has a flag or a crest.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_068.wav|And republics include the small simple drawing of a fish.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_069.wav|The familiar stylized drawing in two flowing lines we all would recognize.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_070.wav|Somebody has pointed out what lots of citizens didn't know that the fish has been four thousands, two thousand years, a symbol of Christianity and Christ as fishes of men.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_071.wav|Small uproar.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_072.wav|Act lue, the American Civil Liberties Union, which will defend the free speech rights of anybody from Nazis to the Ku Klux Klan and back again, has moved in.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_073.wav|The fish defies the separation of church and state.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_074.wav|It must go.
wavs/cooke_1998-02-16_075.wav|Ho hum.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_001.wav|good morning,
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_002.wav|I'm not myself a great collector of old letters but from time to time riffling through the chaos of what I dare to call my files, I come on a note from someone I'd long forgotten and the other morning I fell on a funny shrewd letter from a shrewd, funny man who's been lost to us for much too long at time, a loss that I feel now because at a time of pretentious theories in literature and politics, this man was the sannest of English critics and a splendid slaughterer of sacred cows in England, whether of the left or right the lowbrow or the highbrow as Tom Wolf has been in America.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_003.wav|Philip Larkin,
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_004.wav|I had the privilege of keeping up a correspondent with him and what a loss turned out to be the last year of his life.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_005.wav|We exchanged ideas mostly about poetry and jazz, the word jazz being understood as only and always what we agreed to like, namely jazz from the earliest New Orleans days up through say the 1940s and there and end, the arrival of bebop was to both of us the death now, Larkin called Thelonius Monk, the elephant on the keyboard.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_006.wav|In this as it turned out his last letter there was a PS.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_007.wav|Another thing I note we have in common, you say that you play the Messiah right through every Christmas so do I.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_008.wav|Now I must not assume as people of high and indeed the previous generation always do assume that a permanent item of our culture passes on to the next and the next generation.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_009.wav|Nearly 50 years ago I had the rare weird pleasure of introducing the Messiah to Leonard Bernstein, please don't ask who is Leonard Bernstein.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_010.wav|As indeed one of the greatest living golfers once did ask me.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_011.wav|Leonard Bernstein came to fame with a national audience as distinct from the concert-growing audience when he appeared first on television.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_012.wav|The show was the first 90 minute show in this country, it was a collection collage of music, science, drama, politics, history, anything and everything and Bernstein was one of our earliest stars when he was already blazing his way from Boston to Vienna in the works of the 19th century Romantics, the Russians especially.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_013.wav|One day the small core of our staff, half a dozen of us were sitting around tossing ideas and we'd come to sketching out the Christmas show.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_014.wav|It was then I threw in what I thought was the very hack-nade but beautiful idea of having Bernstein conduct a short version of the Messiah.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_015.wav|Bernstein I remember looked up, handled, he said, with the rising inflection as if it might just as well have been Gershwin.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_016.wav|That's the man.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_017.wav|You know something said Bernstein?
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_018.wav|I don't know it.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_019.wav|Well, need I say he came to and I, as one brought up in the non-conformist north of England and therefore having known every note of the Messiah since the age of five.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_020.wav|I had the pride of standing before a television audience of two hundred and ninety stations and introducing George Frederick, a pretty old German 56 was beyond the usual span in 1742, not doing well with his concert music or operas in bad financial trouble, being invited to go to Dublin for a few weeks and for a price composed and oratorio.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_021.wav|He lived alone in two rooms in a small house but once he had this conception of writing the life of Christ not as a chronicle but as a series of spiritual musical themes.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_022.wav|He scarcely paused from dawn to midnight and his meals pushed under the door and at the end of fifteen days only during the last twilight he finished the hallelujah chorus and wrote in his journal,
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_023.wav|I felt that the Lord God Almighty had come down and did stand before me.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_024.wav|At the end, Bernstein embraced us all.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_025.wav|What a sublime work he said.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_026.wav|One of the oldest musical traditions of New York City is a performance of the Messiah given with the instruments of the original scoring first in 1770 in a church which stands miraculously today only three blocks from the mountainous rubble and ashes of the Twin Towers.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_027.wav|On the 12th of September the minister and the choir master padded in gas masks through the horrors under foot and knew that this year the old tradition was bound to be broken.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_028.wav|However, three months have passed and the ninety pipes of the old organ are still choked and the burning smell is everywhere and the church has stained us no open windows.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_029.wav|The ash and the grime and the smoke came in through the letting but last Sunday once more into an accurate atmosphere the old tradition stayed unbroken.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_030.wav|It may strike some listeners as odd the devils cities New York City which houses two million of America's six million Jews should hold to this by now ancient Christian tradition.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_031.wav|But if you knew New York City as this administration is desperately trying to have it known to the Arab world you would know this to be most characteristic.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_032.wav|Long ago the most elegant asiast of the 20th century E. B. White wrote the most admirable thing about New York is not the conflict of the races and religions but the truths they keep.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_033.wav|The word Messiah exists in many languages though it wasn't until the 16th century that translators of the Bible chose to fix its spelling with an H as sounding more Hebrew and that's the way it stayed.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_034.wav|It means as everyone knows the one who would come and set free the oppressed children of Israel and ever since it has been used in general in other languages and countries to signify the liberator of the oppressed.

wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_047.wav|Well the tale I have to tell is quite another story and shines like a good deed in a naughty world.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_048.wav|The interview came at the end of last week the final tournament of the season and it was won by the young man who is without question the best golfer in the world.

wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_050.wav|Yes it would he said.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_051.wav|His foundation he described simply as a fund with the simple aim of helping poor children of colour make something of the Missileist.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_052.wav|What asked the breezy interviewer is your main goal in life?
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_053.wav|Tiger blinked as if we just had another glimpse of the obvious.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_054.wav|I said the foundation.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_055.wav|My aim is to make it global based in the United States but taking in many many countries and that's far more important than winning tournaments.
wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_056.wav|Here is a young man just 26 who was urged only four years ago by an old well-wishing friend, an old man and a ravenous golfer, urged Tiger to stay one more year in college and quote enrich his life.

wavs/cooke_2001-12-21_068.wav|Merry Christmas.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_001.wav|good morning, one of the most touching and generally unreported incidents of the month was the decision of the Norwegian government to invite Israeli and Palestinian leaders to Oslo for a memorial service in honor of Mr. Rabin, the assassinated Israeli Prime Minister.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_002.wav|It was, I think, an inspired idea to use this service as an overture to a meeting that might walk an inch or two nearer the dishearteningly receding goal of a Middle Eastern peace.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_003.wav|The memorial service set a tone of gravity and the place was a guarantee of neutrality.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_004.wav|Something very difficult to promise when these two sides get together in the Middle East or in the United States.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_005.wav|And then the president of the United States had an idea.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_006.wav|Acting on an impulse, he decided it might help things along if he went to.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_007.wav|He signified, probably a fast email, dear Preciy, I'm coming to.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_008.wav|Mr. Clinton had in mind his own bit of diplomacy.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_009.wav|He heard that the Russian Prime Minister was visiting Oslo and Mr. Clinton thought it might offer a useful opportunity to beg Mr. Yeltsin's man to stop the war in Chechnya.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_010.wav|As it turned out, Mr. Clinton's impulse, his decision effectively gagged any hope of agreement or even useful negotiations between the two principal actors, who, like minor characters opening an opera, were scuttled into the wings while the footlights soared, the trumpets sounded, and the star.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_011.wav|The ruler of the universe took center stage.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_012.wav|That I hope is a vivid image, but it was literally true.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_013.wav|The overwhelming of a subplot, peace talks between Prime Minister Barak and Yasa Arrafat, by the appearance of the big hero, who was not supposed to be there.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_014.wav|A promising diplomatic meeting was hustled out of sight with the arrival of a suddenly alerted press circus accompanying the President of the United States.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_015.wav|Before coming to the main point, I'd better say that Mr. Barak and Mr. Arrafat were in no mood to conduct serious discussions and retired into their prepared positions.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_016.wav|But the truly disheartening story about Mr. Clinton's visit to Norway is the effect of the presidential entourage on the Norwegian establishment and the Norwegian people.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_017.wav|Only one reporter I've come across, one Alex Vardamis, put the thing in its social context, the effect on the ordinary Norwegians, and to appreciate the kind of shock that they suffered, you have to understand the social tone of their own monarchy.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_018.wav|And here Mr. Vardamis put it with praiseworthy if gruesome simplicity.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_019.wav|Quote, Norway is a country in which the king skis on public trails, and the Prime Minister rides the bus to work, citizens pride themselves on an unpretentious lifestyle.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_020.wav|What shocked the Norwegians was the imperial nature of the American delegation, the President arrived with an official entourage of, guess what?
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_021.wav|In Roosevelt's time it might be 1520, say it the most.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_022.wav|The President arrived with an official entourage of more than 700, 700 courteous and sundry retainers who appropriated an entire hotel in downtown Oslo.

wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_025.wav|The Norwegians plainly realized that other heads of democratic states do not choose to boast about their unpretentious lifestyle.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_026.wav|I do not believe there was extensive, or perhaps any, coverage of this imperial takeover on American television.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_027.wav|In fact, what shocked the Norwegians is something that probably never crosses the mind of Americans, who know one thing for sure that they belong to the greatest most democratic democracy on earth.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_028.wav|I used to notice when I went around colleges and universities and sat in on history classes, I don't ever remember any classes comparing the American system with other democratic systems.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_029.wav|I've always wished that one faculty could be established in every American university, better one weekly class in every high school, that should study what you might call comparative democracy.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_030.wav|Every country on earth with strong pretensions to democracy, including the United States, could learn something from discovering where in some things other countries are more democratic.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_031.wav|And the United States, in other things, less so.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_032.wav|The Norwegian trip was alarmingly notable for other expressions of Norwegian sentiment, which to put it mildly did not monopolize the evening news, telecoverage.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_033.wav|I think we'd better not go into the appalling emergency, the Oslo government and the police were thrown into by Mr. Clinton's sudden impulse.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_034.wav|Oslo is a quiet, easily disciplined capital.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_035.wav|Suddenly, suddenly imagine they had to fetch in hundreds of concrete barriers against terrorist car bombs.

wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_039.wav|There, at least half a dozen large and powerful groups of protesters, all anti-American for one cause or another, from people condemning the existence in America of the death penalty, to arom groups who know every terrorist agent kept in an American jail.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_040.wav|Think of any anti-American slogan, and there were angry people there to chant it.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_041.wav|But they did more than chant.

wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_043.wav|There were cars smashed.

wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_045.wav|Many wounded over 80 arrests before the mob broke up and stormed or sulked off.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_046.wav|And Oslo returned to Mayem again, its reputation as the most orderly city in Europe.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_047.wav|President Clinton in Oslo will be remembered by the Scandinavian countries long after some more lurid and riotous world events are long forgotten.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_048.wav|Well, while all this was shattering the general quiet and the Scandinavian picture of America, there was a dispatched from London that both in the papers and on the telly received on the contrary ample and marvelling coverage.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_049.wav|It was the daring act of Mr. Tony Blair in banishing all the he ready to repairs from the House of Lords, all except 92.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_050.wav|Why 92?
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_051.wav|An inquisitive youngster asked me.

wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_056.wav|666, he ready to res have to go, but 92 allowed to stay were elected by the...
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_057.wav|I thought they were all unelected.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_058.wav|Well, it was explained in the New York Times that quote, for most of the century, the House of Lords has held little real political power.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_059.wav|I thought it had none squeaked my complainer.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_060.wav|Little real political power except as a delaying, modifying influence.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_061.wav|Why delaying?
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_062.wav|How modifying?
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_063.wav|The reporter's explanation wasn't helped by a quotation from Lord Strathclyde, the Tory leader in the Lords quote,
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_064.wav|There are already some very substantive powers in the Lords.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_065.wav|No powers, substantive powers.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_066.wav|I believe that this historic move to dispossess the possesses of great land as has somebody put it.

wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_068.wav|Oh please would you be quiet?
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_069.wav|I suppose that this purge is simply the most grandiose, the most daring item in Mr. Blair's long announced program to remove the thatched cottages, the periding guardies, the pomp and circumstance.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_070.wav|All the tourists, beloved symbols of Britain, from the legacy of Britain.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_071.wav|We talked about this when Mr. Blair first announced he was going to detatch Britain's picture in the eyes of the world and substitute for it, a picture of the present day, true Britain.

wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_076.wav|Well I've said it before and I will say it again.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_077.wav|People, tourists are no different from everybody else in living by stereotypes and every minute television re-impresses them on us.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_078.wav|Tourists feel at home when they get to Paris and see the Eiffel Tower and sit in a cafe where an old man is playing a piano accordion.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_079.wav|When they have scunders and thick cremes sitting in a garden alongside a thatched cottage and see a boy slip an envelope into a scarlet round bellied mailbox, they know they're in England and they love it.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_080.wav|As for Mr. Blair's act of daring and firing most of the hereditary's, he would have done more to please Republican prejudices if he'd gone the whole hog.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_081.wav|And followed the lead of the politician who in the year of my birth campaigned up and down the land to get rid of the whole lot to abolish the House of Lords.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_082.wav|This second chamber as it is, irresponsible, hereditary absentee.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_083.wav|This reformer who dead 91 years ago to be a good deal more radical than Mr. Blair was the right honorable Winston S Churchill.
wavs/cooke_1999-11-19_084.wav|He didn't make it.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_001.wav|good morning, I once knew a Russian, I take that back, maybe it can be done today but in my day, you didn't know any Russians, unless you were a spy.

wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_003.wav|One man, however, a jolly-looking man loosened up a little by his vodka, told me two discoveries he'd made about America and I'd better say now that I never saw him again, maybe he was recalled and liquidated for daring to share a couple of secrets with a member of the imperialist fascist press.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_004.wav|He told me, this was probably a fatal slip, that the Russian delegation actually preferred the vodka made in Connecticut to their own famous brand.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_005.wav|He teased cheaper, he said, and he does not carry a perfume.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_006.wav|The other secret was more engaging.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_007.wav|He said the day he first arrived in New York City was on a mild, March day in the morning.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_008.wav|The unpacked and he went out and he walked into a corner, steakhouse for lunch.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_009.wav|Even though he was not a member of the KGB, I guess, he learned and noticed at once two revealing things about America and Americans, like all first visitors of all nations, even the most educated, what he first noticed about a particular place or time or experience was immediately transformed in his brain into a generalization about the whole nation.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_010.wav|We live and breathe by the one-case induction method.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_011.wav|I've just been rereading the diaries of the late diplomat journalist, linguist Harold Nicholson, a cultivated man if ever there was one.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_012.wav|He sales into New York, is picked up by a chauffeur and whisked off to a rich man's estate in New Jersey.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_013.wav|Within two days, he is lamenting the American inclination to turn wild country into a suburban look after a talk with one politician.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_014.wav|He writes, the odd thing about Americans is they never listen.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_015.wav|From then on, he sets down confidently, a little regretfully, quote, the trouble with Americans poor deers is anything he'd noticed about one person, one place.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_016.wav|Well, the Russian and the second of his discoveries.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_017.wav|He sat down and looked over the menu and looked over the town-tale.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_018.wav|And from observing the plates at the nearby tables, Americans eat nothing for lunch but call beef and cabbage.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_019.wav|Odders still.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_020.wav|They mostly wear bright green ties.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_021.wav|Every waiter he could see, war one, and half the diners.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_022.wav|He did not attach these oddities to the date, which would have told him everything.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_023.wav|March the 17th.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_024.wav|St. Patrick's Day, of course.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_025.wav|But another thing he'd not been briefed on when he left Moscow was that St. Patrick, not Lenin, had saved civilization.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_026.wav|He would, however, soon learn all this.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_027.wav|Once outside, he heard to the west a strange hubbub, a sort of surge in the sky like the frequent breaking of a wave.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_028.wav|It was the most conspicuous and joyous of all New York's annual parades, a tramp of the Irish up Fifth Avenue, including lots of men, especially public figures, the Mayor, Senators, Congressmen, Councilmen and Women, judges.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_029.wav|Everybody who needs or craves Irish votes.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_030.wav|Even more representative of men and women in public office or people who want to be, is the parade up in Boston, which you may remember was the American terminus of the Cunard line out of Cove.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_031.wav|Consequently, Boston became the city that landed more Irish in one place in the 1850s in the wake of the famine than any other city in the land.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_032.wav|I hear one young legal friend across the water crying, judges, buying judges?
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_033.wav|Well, yes, one way or another, buying judges is one of the liveliest exercises of political bosses.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_034.wav|And remember city and county and state judges below the courts of appeal.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_035.wav|And of course, the Supreme Court of the States are elected for this practice you have to thank Benjamin Franklin.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_036.wav|Among the myriad problems of government that came up during the making of the Constitution was the question of the integrity of judges.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_037.wav|There was a lively debate.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_038.wav|Franklin, the 17th child of a poor Boston soap boiler and an astonishingly learned man, remarked on the English belief that the best qualified judges would be men appointed by the top lawyers.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_039.wav|But he saw in this simply an old boy's network where promotion came from favors and intrigue and taking care of your own.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_040.wav|Franklin thought that throwing judgeships open to the voters would at least healthily publicize their motives and help people keep a closer watch on the courts.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_041.wav|The first trial I ever covered was of a charming old Irishman who was the head of Tamini, the Democrats' political machine in New York City.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_042.wav|In a seething bewildering city of packed slums and crumbling tenements, his type would help people settle in, meet the boats, help their teenagers out of trouble before, quote, friendly judges.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_043.wav|Get the family before an immigration inspector and after a little under the counter exchange, the inspector would declare the family ready for citizenship.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_044.wav|And in no time the family would be whisked off to democratic headquarters and registered as voting Democrats.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_045.wav|This particular Tamini chief did was accused of buying congressman city officials, not least most of all judges.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_046.wav|But he had not bought the judge who tried him in 1938 on charges of knowing and protecting one or two of the most notorious gangsters who were shaking down the city with rackets that protected your laundry or vegetables, your butcher protected from what?
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_047.wav|From a sudden unnamed villain who might set fire to the laundry, poisoned the vegetables, steal the meat, awful.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_048.wav|If you want to see in one flashing hour how it worked, don't fail to catch the old Preston Sturge's movie The Great Maginty.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_049.wav|Well, James J. Hines went to jail and he was only one example of the determination of the cocky and courageous little mayor, the immortal ferello La Guardia to smash the rackets.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_050.wav|And in the process smash the power of Tamini.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_051.wav|La Guardia ran both as a Republican and an independent fusion candidate and he was elected twice as mayor and did a prodigious house cleaning job for a very amiable corrupt city in my first days here.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_052.wav|Now you ought not from this brief account of the Democrats hold on the city infer that the Irish will the core or fire brigade of Tamini, of the bad side of Tamini.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_053.wav|Most members of Tamini were native born, an amalgam of men of Irish or Italian or Central European Jewish background.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_054.wav|But the Irish always bult large in Tamini and often in their humdrum daily way they did much good.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_055.wav|They helped new immigrants get jobs.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_056.wav|They eased their sicknesses.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_057.wav|They dispensed shoes and other necessities to the poor.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_058.wav|Indeed the Irish were the leaders in this sort of practical politics for which the resident anglos and other theoreticians of political science were privately very grateful.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_059.wav|Tamini,
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_060.wav|I should have said how the society came about.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_061.wav|Very shortly after the revolution, the war of independence, the people who'd been openly then secretly on the English side, the people who deeply resented turning into American citizens, started a society, maintained to this day called the Order or Society of St George.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_062.wav|And only a year or two later some spirited Irish they'd been coming in since the early 1800s.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_063.wav|And proud to be American citizens, they thought they had better acquire a patron saint.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_064.wav|They heard of the chief of an Indian tribe in Delaware to the south, a benevolent, greatly admired chief, a man named Tamamini or Tamini.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_065.wav|He'd do fine.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_066.wav|So they set up the first Deborah Cratt's political machine and called it originally the sacred order of St Tamini.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_067.wav|It ruled New York City politics for 150 years.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_068.wav|La Guadilla they say broke it.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_069.wav|But then we keep hearing that the mafia has been broken or even as a former governor of New York a bold good man of Italian roots said the mafia doesn't exist.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_070.wav|These are some of the thoughts that drifted through one mind, watching the colorful and boisterous and wildly good-natured St Patrick's St. Paret.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_071.wav|This year there was a problem, an embarrassment for the faithful.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_072.wav|We're in Lent and the injunction is for Catholics to forego meat on Fridays.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_073.wav|St. Patrick's Day fell on a Friday.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_074.wav|All the rest strong and no doubt legions of Catholic homes were already stacked with mountains of the sainted dish of choice on that day, corned beef and cabbage.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_075.wav|What to do?
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_076.wav|Well the solution depended on who is archdiocese you lived under and where.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_077.wav|The cardinal of New York issued a dispensation for Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_078.wav|Let beef be eaten and fast another day.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_079.wav|But the bishop who is the shepherd of the flocking queens and Brooklyn and non-long island did not grant the same permission.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_080.wav|200 miles away up in Boston the archdiocese has a tradition dating back it says to the 18th century a tradition of bending the rules.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_081.wav|Speaking of the Irish community in the northeast, the owner of a pub with the glorious name of Shamus O'Toole said for his part he would offer lots of corned beef but also what he calls Salman.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_082.wav|He recognizes a higher court.
wavs/cooke_2000-03-17_083.wav|The man above us he says we look down at us and that's in Patrick himself and say go ahead fellas it's a great day to get it.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_001.wav|good morning,
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_002.wav|I was sitting in a hotel room in San Francisco one day last week, surrounded by a litter of newspaper cuttings to remind me that California of all the states is the one that pushes more initiatives on the problems that plague us from AIDS to environmental action, from smog prevention, children's daycare to banning smoking in public places, drug treatment, bilingual education for the shows of immigrants pouring in from the far east and Mexico.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_003.wav|In California they must in some places print ballot forms in 34 languages and on and on, when one of my oldest friends dropped in on me and after a little while said, I suppose you did a memorable talk on Garbo.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_004.wav|I said no, I didn't touch her.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_005.wav|He was surprised at least, as I think most other members of our generation would have been, to whom greater Garbo was the most vivid motion picture presence of the 1930s and had turned to coin a phrase into a legend.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_006.wav|But when she died, my instant reflex was to recall a sentence of Max Birbon, who was sometime around the turn of the century when he'd taken over the theater criticism from Bernadassure in the Saturday review, wrote about the exquisite, the all-too-familiar tedium of old men rapsodizing about the talents of Mimes we had never seen.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_007.wav|I suffered from this in my boyhood, when my sainted father, from the most generous and well-meaning motives, went on about the hypnotic face of Henry Irving, the fragile beauty of Elin Terry.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_008.wav|And even I remember assured me there never would be another human voice in opera or in concert to compare with Sir Charles Suntly.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_009.wav|Unfortunately, at some point, I acquired a gramophone record of Suntly.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_010.wav|The record which I still own in some catacomb of a closet was made a last at the end of his life, when they issued from the scratchy grooves a faltering whale as of a ghost in a school play, so much for the incomparable Suntly.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_011.wav|Of course, you can say that movie stars are luckier than theater stars in that the making of a movie is in itself an act of preservation, made in the first place for the contemporary audience, but also there to pass on and be seen in its one and only original form for generations to come, so that you could say nobody, however, aged need fear that the young will be oblivious of the talent you're talking about.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_012.wav|Television has compounded this advantage by assuring that the movies of seven or eight decades will be seen long after they are likely to be revived in any theater other than something called the Museum of the Moving Image.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_013.wav|However, to accept this as an advantage, as a permanent blessed link between the generations, you have also to assume that the young maker habit of watching Old Movies on television.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_014.wav|The most comprehensive survey I know shows that they do not, that only the tiniest minority of people under 50 choose to watch the movies of the 1930s and 40s and 50s.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_015.wav|I took up the fame of Gabbo with a woman friend, practically a surrogate daughter of ours, she's 54.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_016.wav|She was impressed but baffled by the page-long obituary of Gabbo in the New York Times.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_017.wav|She said, you know, I don't think I ever saw one of her movies.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_018.wav|Understandable, Gabbo's last film was made 48 years ago when this woman was five years of age.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_019.wav|And there's an English friend of mine in New York in his late forties who is a ravenous addict of television from baseball and news, documentaries, the history of the First World War, the history of the cockroach, and lashings of old movies.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_020.wav|But I discovered that to him, old movies are ones he had seen or hadn't caught in the late 60s or 70s.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_021.wav|Last summer, both of these lively youngsters, God helped me, I suppose, I ought to call them middle aged.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_022.wav|We're staying with us down on Long Island and one evening I put on for their joy and amazement, a tape of what the late Leslie Hallowell called the classic of American sophisticated comedy.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_023.wav|It was Ernst Lubic's Trouble in Paradise.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_024.wav|They both loved it and I myself marveled that a comedy, which tends to date quicker than anything, had retained after more than 50 years its original charm and quick silver mischief.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_025.wav|I was also relieved that we hadn't subjected tender youth into one of our ancient enthusiasm.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_026.wav|Then we discussed the players, who were these people they wanted to know?
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_027.wav|Had they been famous in their day?
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_028.wav|Where were they now?
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_029.wav|Well, I calculated that C. Orbis Smith would now be 126 Herbert Marshall 100.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_030.wav|Next week, they had never seen or heard of them.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_031.wav|Or of Charlie Ruggles, Edward Everett Horton, Kay Francis, the enchanting Miriam Hopkins horrors, 98 this year.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_032.wav|Later, we took up the matter, the fame and beauty of Greater Garbo with these and other youngsters in their early 50s.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_033.wav|They divided about her beauty, some thinking her with her spectral gloom and her thin pencil eyebrows, more bizarre than beautiful.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_034.wav|The Englishman thought, yes, she was beautiful in an old-fashioned way, but they agreed on one thing.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_035.wav|Her films could not be taken seriously.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_036.wav|Camille and a Karenina, to me, Garbo at her peak, were faintly ridiculous.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_037.wav|Why?
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_038.wav|Then it came clear.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_039.wav|The generation gap, which, because it separates two different views of life, can never be spanned.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_040.wav|They confessed that the whole idea of the femme fatale and its slavish presentation in the movies from Theta Barra, over here of her, to Garbo, made them giggle.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_041.wav|Giggle at Garbo?
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_042.wav|Yes, as I could never do anything, but giggle.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_043.wav|When my father took me to see the Karl Rozer opera company in such poignant to him, dramas as Traviata and Urigaleto.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_044.wav|This alarming discovery of some views of life, attitude, romantic conventions that never can be shared between crab, age and youth, was reinforced once for all last summer.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_045.wav|When up in Vermont, I was often a jaunt to an ice cream orgy with one of my grandsons and his friends.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_046.wav|They were all around 1718.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_047.wav|On the way back singing in the car and high on sugar and the caffeine from the chocolate sauce, they felt it is disgusting, their favorite movie stars.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_048.wav|I had never heard of any of them.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_049.wav|When out of valimentary courtesy, they included me in the game.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_050.wav|I was quick enough to edit out of my memories such long, forgotten greybeards as Clark Gable, Gary Cooper, Rita Hayworth.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_051.wav|I suggested that Robert Redford might be a popular candidate and they howled with rude joy.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_052.wav|Redford, my grandson screamed.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_053.wav|He must be in his 60s.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_054.wav|I learned then that the biggest box of his star, not of this year, all last, but of the 1980s, was Kim Basinger, Basinger, Basinger, whatever.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_055.wav|Enough.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_056.wav|It had never occurred to me till then that with the movies as with political characters and heroes, we are all victims of what I call the twilight zone, through which in our youth we all stumble.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_057.wav|Names too late for the history books, too early for personal recognition.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_058.wav|But now, this week, a truly immense figure died, a giant of entertainment, and you might say a world educational pioneer whose creations, if not his name, are known to four generations.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_059.wav|Jim Hanson, this supreme puppeteer of television, who created the characters for Sesame Street, and taught the children of 80 nations to spell without tears.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_060.wav|And through the transference of these characters to the Muppets, provoked several generations in many countries to chuckle and weep over the antics of Kermit the Frog and his wild companions.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_061.wav|Jim Hanson died suddenly in New York at the shockingly young age of 53.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_062.wav|Last week, he was as sprightly as ever.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_063.wav|He developed in 24 hours a rare and powerful form of pneumonia and was dead the day after he entered the hospital.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_064.wav|He was a mississippian who moved to Washington when his father went into government.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_065.wav|He made a puppet in his freshman year in college and started a five-minute late-night television show.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_066.wav|He needed another freshman, a fresh woman, to help with the puppets.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_067.wav|And she joined him first with the puppets and then in Holy Matrimony.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_068.wav|He was only 19 when he built the frog called Kermit.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_069.wav|He put him into commercials and then very soon started Sesame Street.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_070.wav|24 years ago, he introduced the Muppets.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_071.wav|Kermit, Oscar the Grouch, Bert, Big Bird, the Cookie Monster, and with the regal appearance of Miss Piggy, the Muppets turned into a part of Universal Folk Law.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_072.wav|I met him once, a gentle, affable man.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_073.wav|He asked my permission to introduce a wobbling monstrous character sitting in a wing chair, a parody, he admitted, of my own Sunday Night Row on American public television.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_074.wav|As the host of a running series of British dramas called Masterpiece Theater, before he could catch his breath, I said yes.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_075.wav|And to this day, young children, sidle up to me on the streets in airports or are reluctantly pushed by mothers.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_076.wav|And they say, why died?
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_077.wav|Are you, Alistair Cookie, the Cookie Monster?
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_078.wav|Nobody else, I say.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_079.wav|And they either break into a giggle or run shrieking for their lives.
wavs/cooke_1990-05-17_080.wav|Perhaps my enthusiasm and sorrow for Jim Henson, there a touch of selfish gratitude that he guaranteed me, years from now, when I have crumbled, a slight hold on the affections of middle-aged people who will never have heard of me, but will recall with joy or terror, the Cookie Monster, host of Monsterpiece Theater.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_001.wav|good evening.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_002.wav|One morning last week, an airplane that had flown 8,000 miles across the Pacific, radioed into San Francisco airport for landing instructions when it was only three minutes from the end of its trip.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_003.wav|It never landed, a wingtip brushed a mountain on the misdiponensular below San Francisco and the plane blew up.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_004.wav|It killed among 19 passengers a friend of mine, which is my business.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_005.wav|But the business he was in, which was music, was very much America's business.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_006.wav|All the more so because this country is crazy about music of one kind and another, and in a country which tends to make a business in the profitable one, out of any rare talent.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_007.wav|William Capel held fiercely and unhealedingly to a view of his profession as almost a priesthood, which required unwavering devotion from dawn to midnight, unremitting practice, practice, practice.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_008.wav|An almost trembling humility before good music, ancient and modern.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_009.wav|Willi Capel was only 31, and though he'd been a child prodigy being the first to win this prize, and the youngest to get that scholarship, he shunned bump-chessness as one of the infectious diseases of childhood.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_010.wav|He was a small man with black hair and black eyes at once fierce and melancholy, an amiable, impulsive, gentle man, except when he sat down at a keyboard.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_011.wav|You could put before him a new work by Cachitorian or Walter Piston or a minueto by Mozart, and it was all the same to him.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_012.wav|He took a swift melancholy intake of breath and settled to it like a country gas station mechanic facing a repair job on a jet bomber.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_013.wav|He knew he could do it, not in the lumbering, conceited way of a rural mechanic, but in the way of a first-class craftsman who recognizes in every new job, another test of his insight and his skill.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_014.wav|He or rather his wife, a beautiful western girl who was the genuine pioneer wife through these daily audios, would throw a party, and maybe a dozen or twenty people would be there.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_015.wav|She'd have the food ready, the guests gentled into good feeling, and then somebody would mention a sonata, say of Heron Copeland.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_016.wav|Willi would sit at the piano, and his hands would start to dart over the keys.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_017.wav|The conversation of the guests would rise to match it, and Willi would pound all the louder.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_018.wav|Now this sort of contest can only go on so long, but sometimes in a room buzzing with people, the sheer weight and tension of his passion would dominate the room, and everybody stopped talking, and Willi would be thumping or rippling away, and the room would dissolve, and the place, and we were all rocking in some primeval world out of which Willi was making the first articulate music.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_019.wav|It was a shock at such times to hear dinner quietly announced.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_020.wav|The guests trooped off, his wife begged him by a tiny gesture to stay with his obsession.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_021.wav|We would all dine with Willi upstairs, fuming, swaying, beating the keys alone.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_022.wav|He had a very straight back, and no matter how long he played, he was always erect, and his delight or anger at the interactability of the music was purely a personal affair between him and the piano and the composer.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_023.wav|He didn't mind if people listened or talked or laughed.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_024.wav|An hour or more later we'd troop upstairs again, he'd be still at it.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_025.wav|And then a little later or much later, he'd get up sweating like a coal miner, but with an amiable small smile.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_026.wav|About half the guests had come in and had dinner without even meeting him, and he would glide off in the direction of his adored and adoring wife.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_027.wav|She was not around.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_028.wav|She was downstairs cooking him a separate meal, a trial which she looked on as a privilege.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_029.wav|It's hard to picture such a scene as this without suggesting a prima d'honna defying all the laws of modesty and manners.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_030.wav|And in a fundamental sense, of course, as Bernadure once reminded us, a genuine artist is such a volcanic, irreverent character that whether or not he's what they used to call a gentleman, is almost as frivolous as asking if he's a Democrat or a Mason.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_031.wav|But Willik a pal with both modesty and manly, with what energy he had left over from the exhausting daily grind of his music, which absorbed and spent all the juices in him.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_032.wav|I've seen him after day of practice, barely able to squinny out of red eyes, pale and limp, but retaining that benevolent, cocky sort of stance.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_033.wav|He was a sore trial to recording engineers, and murder on the kind of record firm that hopes to make a fast sale out of one side of Chopin and a little simple bark on the other side.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_034.wav|He would not let a record be released unless the thing reflected in every phrase and beat, the best that his talent could do to date.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_035.wav|And this happens, he once said to me, a few times a year.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_036.wav|So he would go to the recording studio day after day, week after week, and the record people who were used to tossing off a smooth record from a fine technician in a couple of hours, would begin by being queasy and end by contemplating a mountain of rejected discs and all their profit out the window.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_037.wav|I have spent this time talking about young Capell, first because it is a privilege to salute this kind of integrity in anyone, an artist who gave no quarter, who would play what he wanted to play, whether his mountain audience had ever heard of Piston or Copeland, was no matter.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_038.wav|Often an audience itching for a familiar tune would make a mental note that if this was the sort of stuff dished up by smart Alec in New York pianists, they wouldn't bother booking him again, and they didn't.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_039.wav|Agents warned him that if he insisted on playing only what happened to be challenging him at the moment, he'd ruin himself.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_040.wav|And as a popular or famous entertainer, he might very well have done that.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_041.wav|He put no money aside, because, as an example, he insisted on carrying with him one particular piano, a vast concert grand wherever he went.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_042.wav|He flew it to Australia, and he shipped it to New Orleans, and he lugged it up to the Rockies at an expense which put the freight companies in ecstasy and his managers in dementia.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_043.wav|Now this sort of single-mindedness which in some people is pathological stupidity, and in others integrity is rare in any country.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_044.wav|I don't want to wish to imply that it's the rarer in America, but this country throws the most lavish and beguiling snares in the way of it.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_045.wav|In a country with a population of 160 million, and one where the arts of communication advertising, publicity, sales promotion, are incomparably swift and efficient.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_046.wav|It is not hard for a clever man or woman in any field who takes the fancy of an influential few to get a national reputation overnight.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_047.wav|Fashion is a stimulating and hardy annual here, and the rewards of chic can be fabulous.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_048.wav|God help you next season, or next year.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_049.wav|Or chic is a morning glory, and the urge to capture it and bundle it depends on the knowledge that it wasn't here yesterday and won't be here tomorrow.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_050.wav|Well, it may very well be here tomorrow, but if the charm of its appeal is that it's new, it obviously won't be new for long.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_051.wav|Now this does have the advantage of bringing really first-rate talents, if they incidentally strike a passing fancy to an enormous audience.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_052.wav|I doubt if there is another country where such a vast number of the population are ever reading at any one time, one lucky prize-winning work by, let's say, Robert Penn Warren or Norman Mala or T.S. Eliot.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_053.wav|But the disadvantage of a civilization in which real quality sometimes gets synchronized with publicity is that the growth of talent and the requirements of publicity don't necessarily fit or mesh.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_054.wav|The talent may persist and grow when the publicity boys for their purposes had better be moving on to publicize a new talent.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_055.wav|So it happens that the first-rate artist may, as in no other country on earth, suddenly make a great deal of money.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_056.wav|When this happens, the temptation to spread his style of living.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_057.wav|Well, the Greeks were full of warnings about it and the Romans succumbed to it, and there's no point in going on about it.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_058.wav|But when it happens here, the charms of social life can be irresistible, or Americans have a brilliant knack for lavish entertaining.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_059.wav|The danger is that the first-rate man gets caught between the sweat and privacy his talent demands, and the wish to maintain the social style he's getting accustomed to.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_060.wav|It is a universal experience, as I say, but the need for an iron self-discipline is stronger in America, I think, especially in the art.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_061.wav|For America, as I said, is crazy about music and pays dear for its idols.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_062.wav|I can see some suspicious people shrugging with contempt and saying, yes, but what music?
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_063.wav|And thinking of jazz, which is certainly indigenous to this country, and has gone around the world.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_064.wav|Well, it may surprise you to know that one gramophone record in three that is sold in this country is a classical record.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_065.wav|And that more Americans pay out money to go to symphony concerts than pay out money to go to all the baseball games.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_066.wav|I didn't say pay more money on concerts than on baseball since the concert costs about twice as much as the baseball game that would be less impressive.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_067.wav|More Americans prefer to go to a symphony concert and do so through the year than all the people that go to baseball games.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_068.wav|Now, a symphony orchestra, I admit, has often been in this country nothing more than a symbol that a town had turned into a city and had graduated from shirtsleeves into the soup and fish.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_069.wav|But today, the standard of these city orchestras is very high indeed.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_070.wav|A young and distinguished English composer, who was overhear last year, told me that nothing had amazed him more in America than the ubiquity of fine music all over the continent.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_071.wav|He said that the city orchestras of places in the Midwest and West could match the metropolitan orchestras of Europe and the two of the Eastern ones stood alone.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_072.wav|He told me about visiting a small state university in the Midwest and the delight of discovering that it had two university orchestras that would do credit to any city.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_073.wav|But what particularly excites me is the great numbers of young people who, against all the current myths about America, have seemingly counted the cost and are yet determined to be first rate.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_074.wav|I've seen it in long list of loons in young jazz trumpeters, in poor Greek Americans painting their arms off and be damned to the commissions.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_075.wav|We all saw it in that moving scene in the movie of From Here to Eternity when Montgomery Cliff snatched the coin from a trumpeter's mouth and in withering contempt for the other man's easy confidence poured his soul into a 12 bar blues.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_076.wav|We saw it as writhing to give the best that sinew if it wears out your nerve ends and the best pianist America has produced in this generation in Willie Capell.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_077.wav|He died a lucky man for not many men come into middle age have been fortunate enough to go through to the end without in some forgivable way compromising their best.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_078.wav|He ended as he began a cocky humble apprentice to the master he hoped to be he left no money but when the wing of his plane touched that mountain he went out like onions, pilgrims undefeated.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_079.wav|He left his courage and skill to him that can get it.
wavs/cooke_1953-11-05_080.wav|Good night.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_001.wav|good morning.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_002.wav|Here is a little exchange of dialogue from an English novel written in 1915.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_003.wav|My dear Mr. Peters,
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_004.wav|I trust I'm not un-punctual.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_005.wav|I've been launching it my club.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_006.wav|I'd versed you to lunch here, said Mr. Peters, but you know how it is with me, and I promised the doctor,
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_007.wav|I'll give those nuts and grasses of his or their trial, and I can do it pretty well, but only when I'm alone, not with someone else eating real food.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_008.wav|1915, that was during the First World War, and what would the Germans practically submarining us into starvation two years later?
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_009.wav|It almost happened.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_010.wav|It was a good time for doctors to recommend rather frugal ways of losing weight when the voluptuous eating habits of the Edwardians were a memory.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_011.wav|Mr. Peters' reference to grasses was salads, green salads, not then a regular feature of English diet of any class.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_012.wav|Necessity turned slimming into a fashion when the First World was over.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_013.wav|Food was still rationed, and the acrobatic steps required to dance to the new American jazz could be done better by a girl as slim as a trout with a flat chest and eaten crop.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_014.wav|Nobody knew for certain how you produced or defied this womanly ideal, except that it somehow involved two new elements people had heard about proteins and carbohydrates.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_015.wav|But then they discovered the new and exciting thing called a vitamin or vitamin.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_016.wav|It needed a small alphabet of vitamins.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_017.wav|The doctors, the scientists, were hard put to it to say exactly what a vitamin was, but they touted it far and wide as a great way of chasing away excess fat.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_018.wav|And they're sprouted all over, so-called health food shops, marketing strange new elixirs like dried fruits, grated carrots, and all sorts of nuts.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_019.wav|By the late 1920s, dieting was practically a national hobby, and the miracle ingredient the vitamin was widely recommended both for taking off weight and then by the 1930s for putting it on.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_020.wav|In 1927, the most authoritative British medical journal caused a stir.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_021.wav|When in a learning piece, it warned that the diet alone consisting of protein, carbohydrates, and yes, even the miraculous vitamins, was not enough.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_022.wav|If you did not, how shall we put it explicitly?
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_023.wav|Keep this food moving vigorously.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_024.wav|There was one essential of what we'd now call additive.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_025.wav|Ruffage.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_026.wav|Ruffage was the word for at least a quarter of a century, till it was redefined as brand, a brand product.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_027.wav|We all started eating brand cereals.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_028.wav|I suppose in my time I've watched the ecstatic leap and the weary collapse of maybe 30, 40 miracle diets.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_029.wav|However, a year or two ago, the whole field of diet for obesity and diet for heart condition exploded under the impact of a medical doctor who in a reputable journal told the profession that in the matter of losing weight safely and permanently and in its counseling for heart patients, it was 180 degrees wrong.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_030.wav|He turned their prescriptions upside down.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_031.wav|Not only should you not avoid saturated fats but a cream luscious meat, you should endorse yourself in those very foods.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_032.wav|What you should avoid was bread, potatoes, pasta, carbohydrates, of all sorts.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_033.wav|Of course, this was precious news to most people, not already under a specialist's care.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_034.wav|Well, the debate it had become a feud will die down.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_035.wav|But what has alarmed the Atkins people and is likely to go on doing so is something else.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_036.wav|An official report issued this week by the orange growers of Florida and California.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_037.wav|They are being buffeted right and left.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_038.wav|They've already suffered from the advice of many cardiologists to their heart patients, to avoid orange and grapefruit juice.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_039.wav|On the grounds that a scormic acid tends to harden the arteries, but the burden of the orange growers protest is that the Atkins dieters warn you to lay off oranges because the sweet taste is the taste of to the late Dr. Atkins a dread carbohydrate.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_040.wav|This week the orange growers say the general demand for orange juice has made their harvest receipts drop 17 percent.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_041.wav|A depressing figure.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_042.wav|The orange growers plight nudges me with the reminder that one doesn't know what I meant the other week with my offhand mention of one of the assignments I covered during the Second War.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_043.wav|When in Florida I watched the process of concentrating orange juice as I said for shipping to British children.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_044.wav|It was certainly one of the happiest of wartime assignments.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_045.wav|In a very small town done Eden on the west coast of Florida, the Department of Agriculture had suggested I take a look at a man they called our mad scientist, a chemist from the mountains of state New York, a true stereo of the fictional type.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_046.wav|Spiky hair, goggly glasses, clothes like an unmade bed, high nervous enthusiasm.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_047.wav|He had caused for enthusiasm.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_048.wav|He had just solved a nasty problem that Britain had presented to the United States Department of Agriculture in America's early days in the war.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_049.wav|The Nazi submarines had got well into their underwater stride and were sinking allied freighters and tankers, even as far west as the Florida Keys.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_050.wav|Britain was already feeling the squeeze of tight food rationing.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_051.wav|In particular the children were short of sources of vitamin C.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_052.wav|Florida had all the oranges in the world, but thousands of whole oranges would take up too much room in ships bottomless, meant for war material and essential goods.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_053.wav|Our doctor Spiky found a way, putting into very small cans the concentrated juice which could be watered down at the other end to make whole oranges juice five times the volume of the original.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_054.wav|Concentrate plus five cups of water that was the formula.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_055.wav|Hugely exploited commercially right after the war to the credit, but not the bank account of the government's doctor Spiky.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_056.wav|During our earlier discussion of dieting and medicine, I should have mentioned the universal comical situation long before proteins and vitamins and special diets were ever heard of.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_057.wav|From the early 19th century on, self treatment consisted of buying anything that was advertised as a magic cure, a cure for anything and everything.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_058.wav|It would take the better part of a century for our countries to set up a government authority to police the claims of patent and acclaimed magic midsens.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_059.wav|Even as late as my boyhood, I remember a famous bottle with a famous name.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_060.wav|Let's say withering gaze long tonic, that's all.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_061.wav|You had tuberculosis or lung cancer, just take a good nip of the lung tonic and ah, that's better.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_062.wav|Can you believe it?
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_063.wav|In the very middle of the 19th century, 1850 exactly, the Empress of cure all tonics, one Miss Lydia Pinkham, brewed her first magical remedy in Lin, Massachusetts.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_064.wav|You would have thought she got the ingredients from the witches in Macbeth.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_065.wav|Finneau Greek seed, pluracy root, black co-bush, unicorn root, water and a secret ingredient.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_066.wav|It was sold and consumed by women young and old all around America.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_067.wav|Lydia Pinkham's vegetable compound, made especially one advertisement wrote for the troubles which beset our sex.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_068.wav|Lydia wrote many of the advertisements herself and they had a unique dignity in delicate matters.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_069.wav|Have you ever had a feeling of fullness around the fundament?
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_070.wav|This is efficacious and pleasant to the taste.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_071.wav|Lydia Pinkham was in her person and in the likeness which adorned all her bottles, a woman of impeccable respectability and was endorsed by many public figures, including the treasurer of the women's Christian Temperance Union.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_072.wav|The assistant let the doctors alone, Lydia Pinkham's compound is better than any and all doctors for it cures and they do not.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_073.wav|What was so bracing, so curative about the compound?
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_074.wav|It just happened to be the secret ingredient, not remarked on especially by the treasurer of the women's Christian Temperance Union.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_075.wav|It was alcohol, 22% alcohol, which is a couple of stiff snorts of the demon itself.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_076.wav|The government eventually, delicately, required her to reduce the percentage to 13.
wavs/cooke_2004-02-13_077.wav|Still, her vast success, especially 30 years after her death during the era of prohibition, was due, an old friend of mine wrote, to her combining the morals of a saint with the business practices of a bootleger.
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_001.wav|for several weeks now, I've been hearing in my mind's ear a voice, it is my voice, it is speaking to you at this moment and it's saying,
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_002.wav|I am standing in a harshly beautiful landscape, in a dry land spiky with the plants that get along with little water, the sauerot cactus and the pineapple cactus and the feathery, pamper's grass.
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_003.wav|And I'm looking at stone carvings, the ruins of an ancient civilization that yet have a kind of dramatic life in the towering figures and the grimace of gods as forgotten as the people who worship them.
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_004.wav|I am in Mexico and I don't know much and for the moment care less about what is happening 1,500 miles or so to the north in Washington, D.C.
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_005.wav|Well, that voice hasn't troubled me much in the past week or so.
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_006.wav|It's rather literary tone was rudely shattered by the voice of Richard M. Nixon ordering the attorney general to fire the special Watergate prosecutor, Mr. Cox by the attorney general's refusing to do it and then resigning by Mr. Nixon then ordering the deputy attorney general to fire the prosecutor and getting the same answer and the second resignation.
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_007.wav|Then finally the president's telling the solicitor general that he was now under the law, the acting attorney general and that he should get rid of Mr. Cox, the solicitor general did it.
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_008.wav|Whereupon president Nixon abolished the investigating team of the special prosecutor along with his job and put under lock and key the vast file of evidence that had been compiled about Watergate and related skull degree by Mr. Cox and his 80 legal assistance.
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_009.wav|In other words the suspect locked up the police.
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_010.wav|Need I say that the harsh ruins of Mexico and the grimace of such guards as Quetzalco Atel will have to wait.
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_011.wav|I am sitting here in New York pondering the harsh orders of President Nixon and contemplating the grimaces of a Congress talking about and taking the first deliberate steps towards impeachment.
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_012.wav|Well, I have a friend who says he wishes that all news stories in the papers would begin with the sentence, Richard Nixon is a rat and then having vented that downright bit of emotion they might go on to report as unemotionally as possible the facts.
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_013.wav|My friend has a point.
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_014.wav|There is at the moment there has been for many months a huge amount of wishful thinking you might say wishful hating in the press mixed in with the running account of what is happening and what under the constitution could happen and could not.
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_015.wav|I know that this diligent mixing of fact and opinion is no news to you.
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_016.wav|It is if anything more common in European reporting than anywhere.
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_017.wav|And the fact is that most American newspapers are still as responsible as any in keeping the reporter and the editorial writer as far apart as possible.
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_018.wav|But before yield to the pressure of our bubbling prejudice whether it is to look on Mr. Nixon as a tyrant or to look on him as a man greatly wronged I think it is necessary to review as simply as possible what has happened and to try and see what went wrong in the view that the Congress took of the job that Mr. Archibald Cox was to do when Mr. Nixon set him up as a special prosecutor to look into the Watergate affair.
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_019.wav|You may recall that last spring the United States lost its chief law officer Attorney General John Mitchell.
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_020.wav|He resigned under the fire of mounting evidence about his possible complicity in covering up the Watergate burglary of the Democratic National Headquarters in Washington.
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_021.wav|He was later indicted by a grand jury on another matter a case involving financial fraud and he's now awaiting trial.
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_022.wav|President Nixon then attempted to restore public confidence in the office of the Attorney General by nominating Mr. Elliot Richardson.
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_023.wav|This was a move welcomed by both parties for Mr.
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_024.wav|Richardson had been an intelligent and humane secretary of health education and welfare and a responsible secretary of defense and as so many shabby and devious men who had worked in the White House began to resign or be fired or find themselves under indictment Mr. Richardson stood out as an honorable man of great intelligence the one figure in the Nixon administration that all the Democrats could trust.
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_025.wav|Now the president nominates that's to say he chooses cabinet offices and Supreme Court justices and ambassadors but under the Constitution the Senate has to hold hearings questioned the nominees and in the end decide to confirm or reject them.
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_026.wav|Long ago Mr. Nixon smarted from the Senate's rejection of not less than two of his nominees for the Supreme Court.
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_027.wav|There was never any question about the confirmation of Mr. Richardson there was no question but there was a careful pause during which the Senate committee looking into his credentials the Senate Judiciary Committee a exacted from him a promise and the Thunderbolt of a week ago the resignation of Mr. Richardson was I believe sparked by that promise.
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_028.wav|During the confirmation hearings last May the Judiciary Committee got Mr. Richardson to promise that the special Watergate prosecutor Mr. Cox would be allowed in his investigations to be absolutely free to subpoena evidence from any source including even the president himself.
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_029.wav|Mr. Cox Mr. Richardson promised would be free of any supervision by the Attorney General's office the Department of Justice and would indeed have full authority even to challenge and fight any claims the president might make to what we now call executive privilege which Mr. Nixon has taken to mean is the president's privilege to keep to himself and release to nobody not to a congressional committee not even to the courts any presidential papers memorandre records of conversations which he the president might deem to be confidential or related to national security it is not a graceful thing for a commentator even to whisper
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_030.wav|I told yourself and I hope I'm not doing it but way back there in May I remember wondering on what authority the Congress could give to any officer of the executive the presidential branch of government the power to command the president himself I looked over the constitution and saw that in the 25th amendment the Congress can set up a body to judge the fitness literally the physical or mental fitness of a president to remain in office but I couldn't remember or find anywhere else a constitutional grant of power to the Congress to get from the Attorney General or any other employee of the president a promise to be independent of his boss however lawyers and congressmen said that it was valid since mr. Nixon himself had concurred in the notion of Mr. Cox's absolute independence by the way I'm still fishing for the document the letter or the speech in which mr. Nixon laid this guarantee on the line well anyway at the time there's no doubt Mr. Nixon was extremely eager to prove that the White House was not covering up the Watergate mess or covering up the earlier cover up he wanted to show that he had nothing to hide and undoubtedly one way or another he assured mr. Richardson that special prosecutor Cox was a man on his own free to delve and dive into any evidence he came up with on this understanding the Senate confirmed mr. Richardson as the Attorney General and mr. Cox went to work with his 80 assistants
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_031.wav|the earlier chapter of the plot is familiar enough but may have dimmed in memory
wavs/cooke_1973-10-26_032.wav|the Senate select committee that was set up to probe into Watergate came to the conclusion that the great question which harried the country for many months was the president implicated and if so how much could best be answered by listening to the tape recordings of nine conversations held in the White House several of them between the president and mr. John Dean the former White House aide the man who more than any other had accused the president of knowing about Watergate and helping to cover it up a federal court decided that it had no power to release the tapes to the Congressional Committee but the same judge did order president Nixon to release the tapes to the court which would pass on what it took to be relevant to mr. Cox and his team the issue is now and only one remove from the judgment of the Supreme Court the president could turn over the tapes or he could refuse and bow as he promised to bow to the final ruling of the Supreme Court at this point the president did neither he proposed to compromise whereby the tapes would be heard in private by a certain senator senator John Stennis a southern Democrat a friend of mr. Nixon but a man allowed by all parties to be of unimpeachable honesty he would decide what concerned Watergate and would let mr. Cox see the full transcript he would also decide what concerned national security and he would pass on a written summary of that without the text the senate Watergate Committee was willing after several backings and fillings to go along with this but special prosecutor Cox was not nor was judge Sirica the chief judge of the United States District Court in Washington who ordered mr. Nixon to turn over the tapes to him through all the seething speculation and legal arguments and newspaper comment the White House made its defiance of the courts very clear indeed when illegal aid to the White House crisply summed up the president's position which was that the president cannot be convicted of a crime and cannot even be indicted so long as he's in office and has not been impeached by the House and then removed from office by a two-thirds vote against him in his subsequent trial by the senate that was the moment when impeachment became not a threat but a practical possibility when the congress came back from holiday a week ago many impeachment resolutions were offered in the House and the senate judiciary committee has started looking into the justification if any for starting the formalities of impeachment suddenly the president changed his mind and the country stirred under a huge sigh of relief he will let judge Sirica hear the tapes in full for a day or two it did look as if we had a president who like some general of a revolutionary hunter was going to declare as the Supreme Court of Chile declared last week that henceforth the law would be what the general said it was but the press exploded and so did the American Bar associations the congress had had enough and most important of all judge Sirica did not quail he was ready to cite the president for contempt and the president came in there are from all indications many more black storms ahead for Richard M Nixon but after this first one a senator Irving likes to say the country is not in ruins the constitution is in effect and the republic still stands
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_001.wav|good morning, the president shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_002.wav|This little regarded and rarely quoted sentence in the Constitution defines a topic that has been shocking our senses during the past few weeks to the exclusion to put it brutally.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_003.wav|I've much public interest in the doings and proposed policies of the new president, the situation I've never, ever known before.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_004.wav|Well, even though the shock hit us a month ago about the manner of the Clinton's departure from the White House, the scandal of several pardons, the looting of the White House furniture, I have been reluctant to talk about it, walking around it in the hope which the Democrats, indeed the Democratic Party as a whole, share the hope that it would go away.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_005.wav|My reluctance to talk about it springs honestly from a fact that very rarely confronts a reporter who tries to tell a story that's fair to all sides.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_006.wav|The trouble with this story is that there doesn't seem to be more than one side.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_007.wav|You must have guessed by now that I'm talking about what has variously been called the squalid Clinton exit, the shrinking ex presidency, and about which the Washington Post, which has been a steady admirer of Mr. Clinton for most of eight years, wrote regretfully last week.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_008.wav|The defining characteristic of the Clinton's is their incapacity to feel embarrassment.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_009.wav|Before we go into what is so shocking or bizarre about the Clinton's exit, it might be useful to look at the normal procedure, the normal behavior of a president leaving the White House on the day of the inauguration of his successor.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_010.wav|I've looked through the comings and goings of the presidents for the past hundred years, for the 20th century only.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_011.wav|Briefly then, in that time, during that century, there were 17 presidents before Clinton.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_012.wav|Looking for the norm, you have to discount quite a few of them.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_013.wav|Two were assassinated, two died in office, three, Coolidge, Truman, Lenden, Johnson, announced early on that they would not seek another term, so they had no further ambition to nurse or promote.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_014.wav|One was impeached and resigned, rather than face a trial.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_015.wav|He knew he would lose.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_016.wav|Two retired to their homes, but remained the titular leaders of their party until a new one would emerge.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_017.wav|Two had served the maximum terms under the new two-term rule, and so joined the remaining five, who went home to a dignified or unpublished retirement.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_018.wav|They, I believe, established the norm, and they included in our time presidents, Eisenhower, Carter, and Ford.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_019.wav|What they did on the election of the incoming man was to do what had been done since the middle 19th century.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_020.wav|They accompanied the new man to the capital, until 30, 40 years ago in an open car, saw him sworn in and quietly left with their wives, and went back to the homes they had left.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_021.wav|So really the normal behavior comes down to what the majority of the people expect or have come to expect about how a president leaves the White House.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_022.wav|The best thing I can do is to recall a memory of the most typical presidential exit I can remember.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_023.wav|A bright, mild day in 1953 in Washington.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_024.wav|The usual date, January the 20th, the day of the inauguration of the former general Dwight D. Eisenhower.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_025.wav|The departing president was Harry Truman.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_026.wav|It was a simple story.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_027.wav|By the afternoon, about a hundred people of every sort had gathered on a street in Georgetown, the old Georgian suburb, where the departing president was the guest of Truman's Secretary of State, Mr. Dean Achism.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_028.wav|The small crowd simply waited until the lunch was over in order to watch Mr. Truman and his wife come out of Mr. Achism's house and leave for the last time.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_029.wav|He came out.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_030.wav|His large glass is delinting in the sun.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_031.wav|He shaded his eyes, saw the small crowd, put his hand up for quiet and said two sentences.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_032.wav|He said, you're coming out here means more to me than many enthusiastic meetings I had as president.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_033.wav|Now I am Mr. Truman, private citizen.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_034.wav|He got in a car with his wife and he left for the railroad station and there he stood on the observation platform of the train and waived and smiled and the train pulled out.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_035.wav|Next thing we learned from his diary.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_036.wav|After he arrived in Independence, Missouri where he was born, he went to the only house he'd ever owned a modest two-story house on a side street.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_037.wav|And he wrote, first thing I did was to take the suitcases upstairs like the old days and that was it.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_038.wav|The first misgiving, shall we say, about Mr. Clinton, was that when he left President Bush to the inaugural luncheon in the White House and the following parade, he went to the airport and spent two hours with a crowd of friends and supporters, complete with microphones and television cameras.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_039.wav|He flew to New York, the White House plane for the last time.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_040.wav|Where it turned out he'd invited 10,000 people to see him land at Kennedy.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_041.wav|The weather was atrocious, only about 1,000 came to here.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_042.wav|But mainly to hear the new senator, Mrs. Clinton, make a political speech.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_043.wav|What Mr. Clinton was doing was swiping the limelight not only from the new president but from the forgotten vice president gore and proclaiming himself still leader of the Democratic party.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_044.wav|Next day he appointed a friend and big money raiser as chairman of the Democratic National Committee, not by custom the privilege of an ex president.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_045.wav|There was a pervasive mutter in the media that this performance was immodest.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_046.wav|Well, not in the best of taste.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_047.wav|And then only days later we heard that the Clinton said walked off with something like $190,000 with the White House furniture.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_048.wav|At first this was not to be believed.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_049.wav|But then came the stupifying, the more incredible story of the pardoning of Mr. Mark Rich.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_050.wav|All presidents in the last days of their term exercised this constitutional privilege of pardoning people who one way or another have committed offenses against the United States, usually who violated ethics rules of Congress, prisoners whose guilt is dubious.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_051.wav|Rarely if ever I believe men indicted as Mr. Rich was or convicted of training with the enemy or as other Clinton pardoned felons of drug dealing or money laundry.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_052.wav|President routinely checked with the Department of Justice to see the seriousness of the offense.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_053.wav|Mr. Clinton did not.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_054.wav|But he said the three lawyers approved Mr. Rich's pardon.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_055.wav|Next day all three said they had never approved any pardon for Mr. Rich.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_056.wav|And all three had turned out had been Mr. Clinton's defense lawyers in his previous troubles.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_057.wav|So what had Mr. Rich done?
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_058.wav|He'd been indicted for a raft of criminal charges here in New York 17 years ago by Mr. Giuliani, New York's mayor who was then the United States Attorney.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_059.wav|Mr. Rich apart from charges of massive tax evasion and money laundering traded with Libya in defiance of the embargo, with Iran while the American hostages were held there, with Iraq through the Gulf War and with South Africa in defiance of the United States embargo against the apartheid government.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_060.wav|Then came up the news that Mr. Rich's former wife had given $450,000 to the coming Clinton Library, three millions to Democrat fundraising lunches, 10,000 to Mr. Clinton's legal defense fund.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_061.wav|Well, once was the time in the long ago when even civil servants in several Western countries were not only expected to do now wrong.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_062.wav|They could be fired for giving the appearance of doing wrong.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_063.wav|Today a great majority of Americans, including many Democrats in and out of Congress, and a host of liberal commentators, believe that Mr. Clinton has given the appearance of doing wrong.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_064.wav|Stronger language has been used most recently, even an ex-president and a Democrat, Mr. Jimmy Carter, has called the Clinton behavior simply disgraceful.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_065.wav|Every day it gets worse.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_066.wav|The United States Attorney in New York has instituted a criminal investigation into the history and circumstances of Mrs. Rich's gifts, and that is where I think for the moment we ought to leave it.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_067.wav|A public question which was asked almost two years ago and comes up again is, did Mr. Clinton degrade the presidency?
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_068.wav|Well, certainly we can say now he degraded his presidency, but we should remember that during the long Roman decadence there was from time to time the interruption of a virtuous emperor.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_069.wav|The presidency is there and new and decent men will come to inhabit it.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_070.wav|And then there is the curious evidence of the polls that still about 40% of the people can see no fault of law in Mr. Clinton as president.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_071.wav|How about as a man?
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_072.wav|Well, the polls say almost 70% now agree he is and this was put to them dishonest and untrustworthy.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_073.wav|But doesn't this affect his standing as president?
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_074.wav|To many people apparently not.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_075.wav|Such people certainly don't believe with Franklin Roosevelt that, quote, the president is assumed to be the moral leader of the nation.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_076.wav|There's finally the fatalist view that Mr. Clinton is not a notable sinner but merely reflects the morality of our time.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_077.wav|Such a fatalist was Edward Gibbon who could write about Rome in decay what might well have been his epitaph on the Clinton presidency.
wavs/cooke_2001-02-23_078.wav|The people became insensitive or indifferent to the debauches of the emperor provided he repaired the roads and remitted taxes.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_001.wav|there was once an English newspaper editor who from time to time would send out a cable to one of his foreign correspondents who'd been working long and steadily at his job.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_002.wav|The cable read simply, go fallow, go dogo.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_003.wav|The idea behind this order or advice was that the man, they were always men in those days, that the man had been too close to the politicians, the people, the life of the country he was writing about, and might have developed a little near sightedness about it.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_004.wav|At any rate, nothing but good, at the least nothing but useful misgivings can come from a break from the bacteria you've had under your microscope all the time.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_005.wav|Well nobody asked me to go fallow or to go out to pasture, which at my age would be a very risky procedure.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_006.wav|Since I noticed long ago nothing is commoner in the world of business and the professions for a keen and vigorous man to say to his wife, complaining about the constant postponement of a long break.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_007.wav|Mildred, the day I'm 65 or whatever, I shall lock up this desk and we'll take off for a trip around the world or wherever.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_008.wav|About a month after the birthday party, the man keels over in Bangkok or Blackpool or some other wonder of the world and to tell a writer to take a holiday is like telling him to stop thinking.

wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_010.wav|Just as the appalling explosion in the marine base in Lebanon was happening and just before the little war broke out to save democracy and Grenada, something came up in Washington that got squeezed out of the running commentary, though it can rightly be called historic.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_011.wav|The decision on the part of the Congress and then on the part of a rather reluctant president to proclaim for only the second time in the history of this republic, a man's birthday as a national holiday.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_012.wav|The man, as you probably know, is the late, the murdered, reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_013.wav|Who during the 1950s in the South and during the 60s throughout all the country was the most unflagging crusader against all the ills, the discrimination, the injustices that black Americans had for over 350 years suffered from.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_014.wav|It all started for him and in the long view for the country in December 1955, when a solitary black woman, no agitator but a comfortable, motherly, sought, refused to follow the immemorial tradition of taking her proper place in a public bus in Montgomery, Alabama.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_015.wav|That proper place was the back of the bus.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_016.wav|I suppose she wouldn't have dared or thought of making her little protest if the year before this supreme court had not reversed its age-old ruling that Negroes were entitled to separate but equal treatment under the law.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_017.wav|The great reversal came on the appeal of a small black girl in Topeka, Kansas, who had to work a couple of miles, including a tuddle across railway lines, in order to get to her black school when there was another public, but all white school practically round her corner.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_018.wav|A lawyer for the little girl, whose name was Brown, challenged the local board of education on the ground that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which guarantees the equal protection of the law to all persons born or naturalized in the United States, was a guarantee that contradicted and overrode the practice of separate schooling.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_019.wav|So in the spring of 1954, the supreme court heard her case immortalized now as Brown versus Board of Education of Topeka, and ruled that the separate but equal doctrine was unconstitutional, that the Constitution is colorblind, that in a word the segregation of blacks and whites in the public schools was illegal under federal law.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_020.wav|We all know by now that in the intervening 30 years the new ruling came to apply, not only to schools, but to theaters, public eating places, trains, planes, employment, and on and on.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_021.wav|However, the first adult challenge to the idea of separatists came from that motherly lady who decided on a day in November 1955 not to sit in a separate place reserved for blacks at the back of the bus, but to sit up front.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_022.wav|She was made to leave the bus.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_023.wav|Other blacks tried to do the same.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_024.wav|They were ejected.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_025.wav|There were small rallies, and there came intimate gamma, the young handsome black figure of one reverend Martin Luther King.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_026.wav|He organized a boycott of the bus company, and there were so many blacks who normally used the buses who just went on walking everywhere, that in the end the bus company gave in.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_027.wav|During that boycott I went down to Montgomery and listened to both sides.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_028.wav|The company's side was that the boycott had been engineered by a minority of blacks, and that most of them were happy enough with the old custom.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_029.wav|I found, by the way, a surprising number, but no majority truly did not want to raise a fuss about it.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_030.wav|Then I went the only white person into a service in Montgomery's Zionist African Methodist Church, one memorable evening.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_031.wav|When this extraordinary young man, in his early 30s, this confident black man, preached in a strangely hypnotic language.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_032.wav|I'd heard only once before from a black preacher in Beale Street, Memphis, an easy, eloquent, earthy idiom that derived from nothing but the Bible, and the poignant repetition of the folk wisdom of the blues.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_033.wav|He certainly hypnotized that swaying, shouting congregation, and even then he was talking about the day of deliverance, such as Moses brought to my people Israel.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_034.wav|We all remember, after that, the years of the Reverend King's leadership, when he became to the blacks, a figure very like that of Gandhi.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_035.wav|He went everywhere, he led marches and protests, he went to jail, he was at the head of rallies, small and huge, that suffered from police dogs, from being hosed down from stonings and other humiliations.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_036.wav|He curbed the hotheads among his flock, and everywhere preached nonviolence.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_037.wav|And on a day at the end of August 1963 held a peaceful and never-to-be forgotten rally of a quarter of a million blacks and whites in the shadow of the Washington Monument in the capital.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_038.wav|I recalled that rally when it was commemorated 20 years later, a couple of months ago, but this time by over half a million people.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_039.wav|Well, the move to have a national public holiday in honor of Martin Luther King started quietly, shortly after his assassination in Memphis in the spring of 1968.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_040.wav|But it was a small, exclusively black movement, and if anybody had publicized it much at the time, I'm sure there would have been millions of Americans who'd have thought of it as a cranky crusade.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_041.wav|The thing must have been gathering momentum down the years without our knowing it, because quite suddenly and surprisingly to most of us, a bill was proposed in Congress, and before we knew it it appeared to be a serious bill.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_042.wav|And a great deal of support was promised to it by senators and congressmen of both parties.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_043.wav|It's still something of a mystery.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_044.wav|How a bill should come to the floor of both houses, the Senate and the House of Representatives, to do something for the Reverend King, which was never done for Thomas Jefferson, for Benjamin Franklin, for any of the colonial worthies, nor for Franklin Roosevelt, not even for Abraham Lincoln.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_045.wav|I'd better remind you now that there are only four national holidays so ordered by federal law.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_046.wav|George Washington's birthday, Memorial Day, Columbus Day, and what used to be called Armistice Day, Veterans Day.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_047.wav|All federal office buildings are closed, including post offices and the banks and most businesses follow.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_048.wav|Independence Day and Thanksgiving Day are holidays not by law, but by presidential proclamation, and of course very few people have been known to challenge their right to work on them.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_049.wav|But the glaring novelty that stands out from these celebrations is that only George Washington is by national law, accorded a national holiday.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_050.wav|You may wonder about Abraham Lincoln, many people have wondered.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_051.wav|There was a movement years after the Civil War to have his birthday proclaimed, at least proclaimed, a national holiday.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_052.wav|But the feeling in the south that Lincoln was not so much the savior of the Republic as its betrayer remained deep-seated, and to this day no southern state observed the Lincoln holiday except Florida, which for so long has been a remote bedroom suburb in the south, for retired or refugee northerners.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_053.wav|So now Martin Luther King, the bill passed with scarcely a descent in the House of Representatives, and in the Senate only two southerners of four nays voted against it.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_054.wav|One was the indomitable Senator Jesse Helms from the Carolinas, who wanted the FBI's file on the Reverend King, started by the way at the instance of Bobby Kennedy when he was Attorney General, wanted that file opened up now to reveal according to Senator Helms that King was a Marxist.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_055.wav|The file was sealed by agreement between the King family and the Department of Justice for 35 years.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_056.wav|And when the President was asked by a reporter if he thought King was a Communist, the President made the astonishingly imprudent reply, well, we'll know in 35 years, won't we?
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_057.wav|He afterwards apologized to the Reverend King's widow.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_058.wav|It can be held that the Congress voted cynically because in the coming presidential election blacks are going to register to vote in unprecedented numbers.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_059.wav|One Senator indeed said if the vote had been based on phone calls, I'm not sure there'd have been any votes at all.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_060.wav|Certainly nobody running for president dared have come out against the bill.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_061.wav|But there was not a whisper of a popular protest movement against the vote.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_062.wav|For the reason I think the Wall Street Journal gave, everybody now knows that since Lincoln's emancipation proclamation, black citizens have not been free.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_063.wav|And the reason everyone knows it's true is that Martin Luther King made America see it.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_064.wav|It was, I believe, put better than anybody by Senator Dole, a Republican.
wavs/cooke_1983-11-11_065.wav|He said it is simply a symbolic acknowledgement that the work of the Declaration of Independence is unfinished.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_001.wav|one day last week an official of the Nixon administration said to a reporter, I don't know why any citizen should ever again believe anything a government official says.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_002.wav|The man might have thought twice if he'd known he was going to be quoted in print, but his bitter remark goes to the root of what is most disturbing about the Watergate affair.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_003.wav|Anxiety.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_004.wav|Now a general anxiety over whether this administration or perhaps any that comes later can restore the faith of the people in a system of government that has taken many beatings in the past and in one historic upheaval was renounced by a whole section of the country, but it has survived and the majority of the people have always been in the long run able to distinguish between the system and the abuse of it.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_005.wav|We hear a great deal today in all self-governing countries from which I hasten to exclude those dictatorships cynically called people's republics about the evils of the system and very often we hear it from people who are abysmally ignorant about how their system of government is meant to work where and when it worked well or even brilliantly or badly and how and when it was betrayed.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_006.wav|The American system includes a great deal more than two political parties elected by majority vote and a large bureaucracy surrounding and advising the presidency and 50 state governments similarly divided between the power of a governor and the power of their legislatures.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_007.wav|It also includes a supreme court to judge the fairness of all their doings.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_008.wav|It defines the proper balance of authority in a long and meticulously written constitution which one of the greatest of English prime ministers called the most wonderful work of intellect ever struck off at one time by the brain and purpose of man.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_009.wav|Well allowing for the parliamentary rhetoric of the Victorians we can still take up that constitution written nearly two centuries ago and read it carefully and apply its precise generalizations to any problem that hurts us today in our local or national government.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_010.wav|It provides for every sort of dispute that can happen between a citizen and his township, his state, his nation, the courts, his employer.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_011.wav|It was no visionary blueprint.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_012.wav|It was a present possibility of tyranny and it foresaw that its own articles would be administered by men of the usual frailty.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_013.wav|It allowed for all sorts of calamities including the supreme calamity of a president who might betray his office through high crimes and misdemeanors.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_014.wav|It set up the procedure in fact for the impeachment of the president of the United States.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_015.wav|In the past week or two the word impeachment has been tossed around rather freely especially by the foreign press and maybe I ought to tell you how it can happen and how it did happen once.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_016.wav|The constitution provides that if the behavior of a president is thought by some congressman to verge on high crime or misdemeanour, he may bring before the House of Representatives the lower house a resolution of impeachment and the House thus acts as a grand jury.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_017.wav|Perhaps it would be useful to point out that the grand jury system existed in Britain until I think it was 1933 when it was abolished, though it had given way to magistrate's hearings about 20 years before that.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_018.wav|At any rate the magistrates, the grand jury in a presidential impeachment case, the House of Representatives sits to decide if there is a case and if it decides by a majority vote that there is then the Senate, the upper house is called upon to sit as a trial court and if it votes by a two-thirds majority to find a crime then the president is pronounced guilty and relieved of his office and the vice president takes over.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_019.wav|It is a very long step from the secret hearings of a grand jury such as we are now seeing in the Watergate case to the arousal of the whole House of Representatives to a resolution of impeachment to the actual trial before the Senate.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_020.wav|It happened to the man who succeeded Lincoln after his assassination Andrew Johnson, a tailor, a Democrat from the rebel state of Tennessee.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_021.wav|He was a weak if stubborn president and he caused that he the president held under the Constitution like his power as commander-in-chief of the army and his power to dismiss federal officials without anybody else's say so.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_022.wav|He defied them by trying to remove his secretary of war and he was impeached.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_023.wav|The Senate failed by one vote short of the necessary two-thirds majority to throw him out.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_024.wav|Well you'll see from even such a mini account of his troubles that they bore no relation to Mr. Nixon's.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_025.wav|There is no possible analogy between the audio of Andrew Johnson and the audio of Richard Nixon.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_026.wav|But there are analogies in the administration of president Harding during the first years of the 1920s.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_027.wav|Those unprecedented scandals involved several of Harding's cabinet offices, the Secretary of the Interior for one, and the deputy head of the infant FBI who turned out to have been in the first war a German spy.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_028.wav|But mostly the scoundrels who fattened their pockets on government oil leases and industrial patents and on the funds of the veteran soldiers bureau secretly and illegally.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_029.wav|These were the so-called Ohio gang, the hometown and home state buddies that Harding had brought into the White House as advisors.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_030.wav|Well the question that now springs to mind is not whether President Nixon's Watergate gang is or is not a shady as Harding's Ohio gang, but whether they have deceived Nixon as completely as the others deceived Harding.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_031.wav|There is very little doubt today that Harding was politically naive and a ruinously indulgent judge of character who assumed that his poker-playing buddies were as honorable in the conduct of their public office as they were lovable in private.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_032.wav|There is alarming evidence already that the Watergate gang in the White House thought of itself as a team of crafty public relations men determined to sell Richard Nixon to the voters by foul means or fair.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_033.wav|Most of them were not politicians, they would have been far more discreet if they had been.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_034.wav|They had come from the worlds of advertising and public relations and real estate and cosmetics.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_035.wav|They were fixers.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_036.wav|And so far there's precious little evidence that the majesty of the Constitution or the glory of the American system was much on their minds.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_037.wav|The original crime, the bugging of the Democratic Headquarters by a handful of simple-minded men who feared Fidel Castro's threat to the United States.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_038.wav|This now looks like something too wild and schoolboyish to be believed.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_039.wav|When these men were caught and indicted and tried and thrown into jail, it did look as the president implied that it was a crude and ludicrous plot properly punished.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_040.wav|When the Washington Post began to dig and hint at a possible cover up by people in the White House, the head of Mr. Nixon's committee for his re-election accused the paper of, in New Endo, third person hears a unsubstantiated charge as anonymous sources and huge scare headlines which the Post knows to be false.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_041.wav|On the post knew no such thing.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_042.wav|It was on to pay dirt and it knew it.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_043.wav|The president assured us all eight months ago categorically he said that no one in the White House staff, no one in this administration presently employed, was involved in this very bizarre incident.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_044.wav|But the president found himself after his sorrowful and stumbling speech to the nation last week, walking afterwards to the press and forlornly hoping that I am worthy of your trust.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_045.wav|It's a hope we must all share.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_046.wav|But the frailty of that hope is at the heart of the case.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_047.wav|For who was involved?
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_048.wav|Who has resigned?
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_049.wav|Who are now highly suspect?
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_050.wav|The president's own White House lawyer, his chief campaign fundraiser.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_051.wav|A former secretary of commerce who encouraged businessmen to contribute hugely to the re-election with large and secret campaign funds, four personal White House assistants, most of all men at the very top of the White House hierarchy, the White House chief of staff and the president's chief advisor on domestic affairs, Holderman and Ehrlichman.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_052.wav|Two of the finest public servants, the president said only last week, it has been my privilege to know.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_053.wav|But now it comes out that these two fine public servants ordered the burgling of the files of a psychiatrist who had treated Ellsberg, the defendant in the Pentagon paper's trial.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_054.wav|Meanwhile, we heard that the judge in that trial had been approached by the White House with the suggestion that he might like to become the head of the FBI.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_055.wav|It's almost too monstrous to take in.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_056.wav|Not to mention the fake letters sent out under the fake letterhead of the Democrat Senator Musky.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_057.wav|And the so-called citizens' telegrams composed in the White House and quoted by the administration as proof that the people were behind the president in his bombing of Hanoi.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_058.wav|Is it conceivable that Mr. Nixon knew nothing of the Watergate bugging, the elaborate cover-up planned by his own top staff, the fakery of the telegrams, the enormous slush fund, some of it illegal, being raised on his behalf.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_059.wav|He says it is so, that he is a man more syndicates than Warren Harding.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_060.wav|But now, in the moment of seeming contrite, he's ordered all his past and former advisors to refuse to talk to a grand jury or a congressional committee about any conversations on Watergate that they held with him.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_061.wav|Why, if he's innocent, should he do this?
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_062.wav|What he has now done is to prod into new life, new defiance, Senator Sam Irvin's Senate Committee that begins to investigate Watergate, in televised hearings, in mid-month.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_063.wav|Yet, I think that we must, for the time being, give the president the benefit of the doubt, for to believe that he knew all about it is to say something worse than that Mr. Nixon is a disastrously gullible judge of character.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_064.wav|It is to imply that a vast majority of the voters are morally numb.
wavs/cooke_1973-05-05_065.wav|And if that were so, then the days of the Republic would be numbered.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_001.wav|good morning, a poll taken by a serious New York City magazine.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_002.wav|I don't know how statistically pure this poll was, but the result was so much more astonishing than anything the editors had guessed at, that they felt bound to publish it.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_003.wav|It was taken in and around New York City.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_004.wav|The question, how often do you watch the news or any of the proceedings connected with the impeachment of the president?
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_005.wav|The answer, 94% said they'd had it up to here and made a point of seeing and hearing no more.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_006.wav|It's my hunch merely that this is probably true of most listeners and viewers around the world.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_007.wav|So I shall hold on my shaky vat as they offer the topic until it's about to be resolved.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_008.wav|I must however mention a turn in the plot that makes us seem to be living through a motion picture by the director who did such wickedly funny things in the lady Eve and the great Maginty and Christmas in July.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_009.wav|Remember Preston Sturges.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_010.wav|Consider first the sheer grotesqueery of the Congress being called for a formal joint session to listen to a political sermon by a leader who is at the moment on trial for high crimes and misdemeanors.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_011.wav|I mean the almost hilarious ceremony last Tuesday evening of the annual State of the Union address the most ceremonial evening of any presidency.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_012.wav|With first the members of the House flocking in, then the Senate, then the cabinet, then solemnly trupping one behind each other the Supreme Court, then up in the strangest gallery ambassadors and various distinguished guests, and finally to a standing ovation the defendant.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_013.wav|Now a fine Sturges twist.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_014.wav|A week or more before this great occasion the Republican leaders in the Senate suggested to the President that in view of the unusual circumstances, he being an indicted criminal at all, perhaps he'd rather postpone his annual address to Congress, or why not put it all together.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_015.wav|Had they forgotten whom they were appealing to?
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_016.wav|Well, Mr Clinton's response to the Republicans, you've got to be kidding, and he went ahead with the thing he does best, with a brilliant all-embracing review of the problems of the USA, the world, the universe, a performance, given a wonderful air of spontaneous intelligence and erudition by the invisible device of what's called the three-way wrap-around teleprompter.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_017.wav|What's called in Britain, I believe, an AutoQ.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_018.wav|Anyway, you know that politicians and television actors have had for 50 years or more a professional lifeline in the prompt of the text of their speech printed out on a running belt of paper.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_019.wav|It used to be just below the lens of the camera they were looking into.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_020.wav|Just one text running from left to right, that you could spot the speaker's eyes following it like suspicious little mice scurrying from one shoulder to the other.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_021.wav|By now though, the new device is an absolute godsend, to people who are not hot at spontaneous, extemporary speaking.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_022.wav|Ronald Reagan was a prime example.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_023.wav|They have three teleprompters, or rather three scripts running continuously from the far left, nine o'clock, say, to the far right, three o'clock.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_024.wav|In an ever-moving semicircle, so the speaker can turn, pause, drop his head, wherever, and whenever he looks up, there's his speech in three versions.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_025.wav|The beauty part is the whole device is invisible to the audience.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_026.wav|And during Tuesday evenings, performance even skeptical or scowling Republicans sitting on their hands there must have mumbled with the watching millions, and still the wonder grew that one small head could carry all he knew.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_027.wav|Result.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_028.wav|Next day, one of the most dependable of public opinion polls showed Mr. Clinton's popularity rating had gone up from 67% to 76.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_029.wav|One of his most powerful opponents, the Reverend Pat Robertson, the conservative television evangelist, who has been bain for Mr. Clinton's resignation throughout the past year, announced the president has hit a home run.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_030.wav|He thought if the trial went on, the Republicans would pay a terrible price in retribution at the election next year.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_031.wav|They might, he said, as well, dismiss the impeachment hearing and get on with something else because it's over as far as I'm concerned.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_032.wav|This is the most astounding turn around of any of the president's political enemies.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_033.wav|It sent bitter shutters through the Republican leadership in both houses.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_034.wav|Meanwhile, the television reporters and commentators Gamely told us that we were witnessing the most historic trial of the 20th century, even as millions were turning it off the moment it came on.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_035.wav|However, there was something happened last Monday, which along the whole stretch of American history may turn out to be more historic, a more conspicuous landmark in the American journey than any trial.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_036.wav|Last Monday, we celebrated the only national holiday named after a human being.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_037.wav|There is no Thomas Jefferson Day or Franklin Roosevelt Day or Thomas Edison Day.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_038.wav|No more George Washington's birthday or Lincoln's birthday as separate sacred holidays.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_039.wav|Their birthdays have been combined on a day in between and called President's Day.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_040.wav|An unfortunate blur for hero worshipers.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_041.wav|But we have the very odd day in the calendar once a subjective controversy and now taken for granted after only 12 years.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_042.wav|Last Monday, all the federal government offices were closed.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_043.wav|The stock market suspended trading, many offices and banks and most schools closed.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_044.wav|It was Reverend Martin Luther King Day.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_045.wav|It is sort of startling to realize after a lifetime of pauses and parades in honor of Washington, Lincoln, of Columbus, and in the south of Robert E. Lee, that at the very end of the 20th century, the one human honored exclusively with his birthday set aside as a national holiday should be a young black minister from Atlanta, Georgia, who saw it into public fame at the age of 26 when he just started his ministry.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_046.wav|His life had been the straightforward humdrum routine of a family, father and grandfather, both Baptist ministers.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_047.wav|He followed the Pious Well-Worn Path, Public School, College, Theological Seminary, Boston University, Co-Pastor of a Church.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_048.wav|When on the 1st of December 1955, the blacks of Montgomery, Alabama, the capital city of the old Confederacy staged a boycott of the City Bus Service.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_049.wav|It had been arranged by the famous black organization, the NAACP, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_050.wav|The middle-aged, young middle-aged black woman was chosen to refuse to give up her seat in the white section of a bus.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_051.wav|The bus driver asked her to move in accordance with the city law of separate seats, which, if defied, could put the company out of business.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_052.wav|The lady still refused, and the driver had to call in the police and arrest her.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_053.wav|Suddenly, the doorsteps of colored homes throughout several sections of the city were littered with thousands of printed hand-bills mysteriously dropped within the hour.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_054.wav|The boycott began.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_055.wav|The stories up north were all of a piece, a spontaneous revolt of blacks against the ancient, now insufferable, separation of the races in public places, which the Supreme Court only 18 months before had outlawed everywhere.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_056.wav|I went down to Montgomery in the middle of the boycott, and in the evening went, as the only white, into a black rally at the Mount Zion African Episcopal Methodist Church, where 35 black pastors hummed and chanted and awaited the coming of their savior.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_057.wav|I couldn't guess who he might be, but when a side door of the vestry opened and a compact young, solemn, ebony black man gliding in, I wrote at the time it was like the relief of maficking.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_058.wav|His name was Martin Luther King.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_059.wav|He rose to a silence as he meant as the ovation, and he read out to them what he called a constitution for our cause.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_060.wav|Now in view of the aftermath, you'd think it would have been as memorable as they get his burger dressed.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_061.wav|Weirdly, it was written in federal or company jargon, about the internal and external attachment in terms of organizational structure and implementing all sorts of things with respect to transportation.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_062.wav|It never crossed my mind then that this man could possibly become the inspired and inspiring leader of the whole integration movement, but he soon changed his tune.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_063.wav|He learned to proclaim with ringing simplicity.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_064.wav|He led marches.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_065.wav|He was despised and abused and stoned and wounded and went to jail.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_066.wav|Till the disgust of militant blacks and the vast relief of whites everywhere, he led massive and massively peaceable marches on Washington against discrimination and against the war in Vietnam.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_067.wav|I think it's fair to say that no other leader could have led so many millions of protesters with so little bloodshed.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_068.wav|And then in his 40th year he was shot and killed in Memphis, Tennessee.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_069.wav|15 years later, there was a move in Congress spurred by blacks, of course, to make the Reverend King's birthday a national holiday.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_070.wav|There was widespread opposition, but the legislation eventually went through Congress.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_071.wav|President Reagan at first resisted, but eventually signed it and proclaimed the third Monday in January as a national holiday.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_072.wav|A question nobody has noticeably asked to this day is why, considering the long parade of national heroes of all degrees and statues, statesmen, soldiers, humanitarians, inventors, why?
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_073.wav|It is a delicate question to put because it instantly suggests to some nervous people that you're suggesting it shouldn't have happened.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_074.wav|It's still worth thinking about, and I honestly don't know the answer.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_075.wav|Being murdered has something to do with the hollowing of a good man, of presidents especially, the halo drops on them.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_076.wav|For Dr. King I think collective white guilt could mean something.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_077.wav|The relief after the city's blew up, that the Reverend King alone had been responsible for the following and widespread uneasy peace.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_078.wav|I think his naming was an act of gratitude.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_079.wav|So, the third Monday in every January is a reminder that the great promise of the Constitution in its first sentence to form a more perfect union has still to be worked on.
wavs/cooke_1999-01-22_080.wav|Come to think of it, perfect would do.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_001.wav|good morning.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_002.wav|Last Thursday was Thanksgiving, the first truly American festival.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_003.wav|And the one that sets more millions of Americans in a turmoil of transit, criss-crossing thousands of miles to join long separated families, at a feast of turkey, cranberry sauce, sweet potatoes, and pumpkin pie.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_004.wav|The strange unknown foods that the native Indians introduced to those starving English men and women and children who'd landed 380 years ago on the bleak and unfruitful soil of a Massachusetts cape.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_005.wav|This festival was inspired by a letter from America written by a Yorkshireman, son of a farmer, written as a report on his first transatlantic voyage, along with other mostly humble folk who sought a new land across the ocean in order to practice a religion freed from the corruption in 1620 of the Church of England.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_006.wav|They had none of our advantages.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_007.wav|So William Bradford's writing is bereft of parliamentary English, congressional English, business English, advertising English, or the lawyers English we've been exposed to for the past fortnight in the case of Gore versus Bush.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_008.wav|This company of very mixed social types, just over a hundred of them, had been 64 days out of England and meaning to settle at the mouth of the Hudson River and start a trading post.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_009.wav|However, this is William Bradford's account of what happened.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_010.wav|I thought it might be a refreshment.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_011.wav|But after they had sailed that course about half a day, they fell among dangerous shows and roaring breakers and they're with conceived themselves in great danger.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_012.wav|But the wind shrinking among them with all, they resolved to bear up again for a cape to the north, later to be known as Cape God and thought themselves happy to get out of those dangers before night overtook them as by God's providence they did.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_013.wav|And the next day, they got into the Cape Harbor where they rode in safety.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_014.wav|Being thus arrived in a good harbor and brought safe to land, they fell upon their knees and blessed the God of Heaven who had brought them over the vast and furious ocean and delivered them from all the perils and the miseries again to set their feet on the firm and stable earth, their proper element.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_015.wav|During the relentless battle between the vice presidents' flock of lawyers and Governor Bush's flock of lawyers, 72 in all, a foreign friend called me to wonder if life still went on in the United States.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_016.wav|The question was not a naive man, but when it comes to picturing life in a troubled world spot, we're all inocents.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_017.wav|I remember during the civil uproar in Beirut writing to a friend they're wondering if she was safe and sound.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_018.wav|She sent back a colour photograph of herself with friends in swimsuits stretching by the poolside at one of Beirut's swankier hotels.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_019.wav|One, of course, still intact.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_020.wav|And I recall how in the 1960s how many anxious friends in London would ask in letters if we stayed off the streets, if we too had been mugged.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_021.wav|True at the time, about once, sometimes two, even three people a week were mugged in New York City's eight parks, but that still left seven millions of us unmarked.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_022.wav|If you've read the nightly television stories about our crisis in civil aviation, the desperate flight controllers, the airports are drifted with thousands of stranded travelers.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_023.wav|I have to tell you that my wife and I have just survived with ease two cross continental trips.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_024.wav|Thanksgiving Eve, the worst airline travel day of the year, has come and gone with a record low in accidents, flight delays and general misery.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_025.wav|So to quote one of my favourite columnists on Turkey feast morning, whichever way it goes, we live with it, no armageddon yet.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_026.wav|Well, we left William Bradford and his crew on their knees giving thanks to the god of heaven for having saved them from the vast and furious ocean.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_027.wav|But that's not what Thanksgiving is about.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_028.wav|Within 24 hours, they had good cause to be mown the place they landed on.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_029.wav|They had intended.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_030.wav|When they left Plymouth two months before to land in Virginia, Earth's only paradise wrote in English poetry, who'd never been there, where nature hath in store foul, venison and fish and the fruitfulest soil.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_031.wav|But they missed the southern coast of Virginia.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_032.wav|Storm sent them up 500 miles north, kept them from the Hudson channel, blew them another couple of hundred miles.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_033.wav|And on Cape Cod, found what?
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_034.wav|No friends, no houses, no inns.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_035.wav|But I quote from Bradford, a hideous and desolate wilderness full of wild beasts and wild men.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_036.wav|Well, it was as I hinted those wild men who saved most of the puritans with their introduction of the unknown to Europeans, Turkey, potatoes, and a red berry they'd never seen either, which was the only fruitful growth on the Cape.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_037.wav|The cranberry bogs produced this red berry, which, as an accompanying source, is, as one of the Bush go lawyers might say, considered mandatory at the family's Thanksgiving dinner.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_038.wav|I'd better say at once that cranberry source is, to me, one of those things you must be born to, like peanut butter and drum majorets.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_039.wav|Today, cranberry juice has become a mad fashion in this country as a health drink of choice recommended strongly, even by cardiologists, heart doctors.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_040.wav|Since the recent large, and I believe first long term clinical trial, of vitamin C pills, which reported that whatever else vitamin C supplements may do, they are first rate producers of hardening of the arteries.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_041.wav|Consequently, an eminent cardiologist predicts that the retreat from orange juice will be as fast as the advance on cranberry juice.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_042.wav|All I can say with the Japanese who they say started this fashion is rots of rock.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_043.wav|I deduced, I think you believe correctly, that there were four dishes that saved the puritans life, not to mention, of course, the cod swimming by.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_044.wav|The cranberry is the one that would most interest most listeners, since most of them today have known about turkey and potatoes for centuries.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_045.wav|Not long ago, I ran into an old English lady who said, turkey escaped from America.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_046.wav|What rubbish, why my grandmother had a turkey every Christmas?
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_047.wav|That was in the middle of the 19th century.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_048.wav|I hope I made it clear at the start that William Bradford ate his first turkey in 1621 when he was 43, but many of the puritans did die from starvation during that first winter.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_049.wav|It was in the late summer of 1621 that they had their first harvest.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_050.wav|They'd learned too about planting the crop known from the Canadian border to the tip of Chile as corn, but in England just to be different as maize.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_051.wav|I often wondered how that early maker of breakfast cereals would have done if they tried to popularize maize flakes, which is what they are.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_052.wav|Well, it was someday after the first harvest was in and the Bradford crew knew that they were in made up a hymn.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_053.wav|The one we see now is a 19th century invention and gave up a public prayer of Thanksgiving.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_054.wav|That's what we'd like to say is the origin of the continental blowout that took place last Thursday.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_055.wav|In dry fact, it wasn't until the middle of the 19th century.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_056.wav|When somebody thought it would be a charming thing to have a national day of Thanksgiving, really to congratulate each other on having settled in America or having been born American.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_057.wav|This year you'll gather, there are in some places, some misgivings.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_058.wav|Anyway, it wasn't until 243 years after the supposed event that Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a national day of Thanksgiving.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_059.wav|Many, if not most, states paid no attention.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_060.wav|But gradually over about 80 years, it dawned on people.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_061.wav|It was yet another excuse for another day's holiday.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_062.wav|Finally, Franklin Roosevelt not only proclaimed it, but read it over the radio and put in a little sermon of his own about William Bradford in company.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_063.wav|And by 1940, it had become an immovable feast celebrated by act of Congress on the third Thursday in November.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_064.wav|Forty years ago this weekend, there was a terrific national panic that blew up.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_065.wav|When a month or so before Thanksgiving, the pure food and drug administration, which passes on the safety of all crops and new drugs, but out a general warning, the cranberry crop set aside for Thanksgiving had been found, well, two shipments anyway, to contain a weed killer, poison, amino triazole.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_066.wav|The secretary of Health, Education and Welfare was instructed to go through the entire Thanksgiving reserve to see how much threatened the survival of the nation.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_067.wav|Two small bags of cranberries were found to be suspect.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_068.wav|The recessed of the seven million pounds he searched were safe, home free.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_069.wav|On the Wednesday evening before Thanksgiving, an enterprising reporter asked if President and Mrs. Eisenhower were going to serve cranberry source as usual.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_070.wav|None of your business, the White House, replied in the days when you could say such things.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_071.wav|Quite right.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_072.wav|A little later, your own enterprising reporter made inquiries.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_073.wav|President Eisenhower, the American hero of the Second World War, served Apple source.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_074.wav|Everybody wondered this weekend what they ought to be thankful for.
wavs/cooke_2000-11-24_075.wav|Miss Gail Collins, the New York Times' light-hearted columnist, said New Yorkers ought to give thanks that they live in a Chad-free zone.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_001.wav|thinking about the British election this week, which for reasons we'll go into a lot of influential Americans were doing,
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_002.wav|I had a sharp memory of the first press conference John F. Kennedy held when he was only President-elect.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_003.wav|In other words, he'd been elected in the November of 1960 and would not take office till the end of January.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_004.wav|It's always, if not a carefree time, a happy, confident time.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_005.wav|The new man takes a holiday around Christmas time and baskets in the glory of his new eminence.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_006.wav|No president can ever really take a holiday, but Kennedy took off for Palm Beach where his father had a spacious house and for a couple of weeks or so it was the winter white house.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_007.wav|Well, Kennedy had not been there many days before.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_008.wav|He called a press conference.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_009.wav|Wherever he travels, the core that's the reporters assigned by their papers to the White House travel with him.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_010.wav|And there were this time about 20 of them, including one foreign correspondent, me.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_011.wav|We were all taken under Secret Service escort to Old Joe Kennedy's house and Kennedy settled in to talk for an hour about the domestic policies he was going to propose and then after a break about foreign policy.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_012.wav|In the second hour, he said,
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_013.wav|I remember that one of the first things he wanted to do was to call on Mr. Krushchev.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_014.wav|He had the refreshing attitude that it didn't matter whether Mr. Krushchev came to Washington or he went to Moscow.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_015.wav|The great thing was to try and halt or regulate the nuclear arms race.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_016.wav|This was almost 23 years ago, as it was they met in Vienna.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_017.wav|He also thought he must have a meeting in Paris with President De Gaulle.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_018.wav|And as a Catholic, a fact of his life he'd been careful to insist during the campaign was secondary to his duty as President of the United States.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_019.wav|As a Catholic, he'd like to call on the Pope and he had an urge to visit his great-grandfather's village in Ireland.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_020.wav|Now in those days, at Presidential press conferences, the foreign press did not put questions, a convention that I noticed is now dwindling.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_021.wav|So I waited till it was over and back at our hotel I button-holded one of his two or three closest advisors, an old Boston buddy of the several that then carried the affectionate title of the Irish Mafia.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_022.wav|I said to him, how about London?
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_023.wav|Isn't he going to London?
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_024.wav|The man looked at me with almost paternal tenderness.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_025.wav|London, he said.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_026.wav|Well, he might go to Berlin and of course Moscow, he said in Paris, but he knows that Britain doesn't really count anymore.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_027.wav|Sure, he may pay a courtesy call on Old Macmillan, which he did, but the so-called special relationship has simply ceased to exist.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_028.wav|It was something that Britain's took a long, reluctant time to realize.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_029.wav|I suppose it's acceptable to everybody today.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_030.wav|Or should I say yesterday?
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_031.wav|Because today, during the past couple of weeks, many of the most powerful of America's pundits, I mean newspaper columnists and television commentators, have transferred their base of operations from Washington to London, and been telling us what to think about the British election.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_032.wav|There have been more of them than usual because I believe that whatever else Mrs. Thatcher has or has not done, she has committed herself so strongly to the United States as Europe's defensive shield and becomes such an uncompromising ally and friend of President Reagan, the dogged economic policies they share have a lot to do with it.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_033.wav|That she has for better or worse, revived the special relationship.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_034.wav|Britain is today thought of in Washington, and of course in particular in the White House, as America's most dependable ally, which means among other things that the people who fear or oppose the reinforcing of American medium-range missiles in Europe are, in both countries, the identical types, who get out and parade and protest.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_035.wav|Most other people, the many millions who are not happy about planting more and more missiles against the Soviet unions, planting of more and more missiles, accepted.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_036.wav|However, there's another point.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_037.wav|I don't think there's any question that the episode of the Falklands, though it's nothing like as green and vivid a memory as it is in Britain, was a surprising reminder that a head of government can set a course, a dangerous one, and fight it out.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_038.wav|Among all the Americans I talked to, Mrs. Thatcher's policies are either dimly understood or not talked about at all.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_039.wav|They think of her as a leader, and the Western world seems to pine for leaders.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_040.wav|Now this may be a good or a bad thing.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_041.wav|Leadership in a democracy in peacetime has to be by the very nature of our system, a compromise with the strongest elements in two or three parties.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_042.wav|It's not very dramatic.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_043.wav|Lyndon Johnson, I think it will be seen in time, was a remarkable democratic leader.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_044.wav|He had the cunning to guess what was the most he could get.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_045.wav|He had the Blani to cajole and seduce his opponents.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_046.wav|When he took over from the gallant figure of John Kennedy, there were about 90 of Kennedy's proposed bills, languishing or dying in one or other or both houses of Congress.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_047.wav|Within three months of Johnson's presidency, more than two-thirds of those bills had been acted on and passed.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_048.wav|It's not an exploit that has earned Johnson much of a name as a famous leader.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_049.wav|But mention Mrs. Thatcher and people think of the spunk required to fight the Argentines.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_050.wav|They don't think of the cost, then or the appalling cost that's going to have to be paid to maintain 1800 people on an island 8,000 miles from home.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_051.wav|Well, all this and much more about Mrs. Thatcher's character has been stressed these past weeks, the American commentators dispatched to London, confessed themselves bewildered.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_052.wav|They don't understand how a country with the heaviest unemployment since the Great Depression, a people paying more taxes than they did four years ago, with industrial productivity down 10%.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_053.wav|Can somehow seem not to let these things count when it comes to picking the next Prime Minister?
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_054.wav|They've reported carefully and well about the appeal of the Liberal Social Democratic Alliance, and about the fatal contradictions and squabbles in the Labour Party.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_055.wav|But also, more than at any other time, they have all gone out on a limb and not merely predicted a whopping victory for Mrs. Thatcher, but assumed it.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_056.wav|Mr. James Reston, the old Scott, whose 60 years in America have not scraped the Calvinism from the marrow of his bones, he's about as canny a reporter as you can find.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_057.wav|He's followed American and British politics for well over 40 years, and he does not tip his hand till all the cards are on the table and the game is called.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_058.wav|But a week before the election, he sent back a piece to the New York Times with the title, How Maggie Did It.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_059.wav|His piece began.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_060.wav|The British election has been the best play in London this season.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_061.wav|It should be called Maggie, or how upstairs tamed downstairs and made them like it.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_062.wav|He put her success down to toughness and to luck, especially to her being lucky in her political opponents.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_063.wav|He saw Mr. Foot as a man who forgot that the age of his kind of socialism, like the age of chivalry, was over.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_064.wav|In his own dimension of issue, as Reston remarked, what will Maggie do now that she's got it?
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_065.wav|Nobody here knows except that she has probably kept the British from getting out of the common market in Europe and breaking with the United States on the defense of the Western Alliance.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_066.wav|For this there is general but uneasy approval and yet admiration for Maggie.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_067.wav|He ended with this, moral of the fable, never underestimate the power or luck of a woman.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_068.wav|It may be since you're hearing this after the event that you won't think Mr. Reston took any risk at all.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_069.wav|He has never called an American election before the returns were in.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_070.wav|But I ought to tell you that I am recording this talk deliberately 24 hours before the election.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_071.wav|Commentaries that are wise after the event are tenor penny and do nothing but contribute to the self-esteem of the commentator.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_072.wav|Some time ago I went through some yellowing files of two famous British weaklers, which as profits and recorders of events were at the top of the heap in the anxious years of the 1930s.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_073.wav|One was not what we then called right wing, it was decently, prudently, thoughtfully conservative.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_074.wav|They are there was frankly left wing, bold, fearless, much like the American magazine in the New Republic.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_075.wav|Every week sounding, frightening and very impressive warnings about where Europe was held.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_076.wav|Look at their editorials and their predictions today and they were both not dead wrong, only about 90% wrong.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_077.wav|Life, hearing itself so noisily described and advised, simply tipped toad out of hearing and went its different way.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_078.wav|It reminds me of the roofal remark of the old Baltimore newspaper man, HL Minkin, who once said,
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_079.wav|After sitting in on the editorial conferences of my paper for over 30 years, I reeled out into the daylight wondering how God had got along all these years without the New Republic and the Manchester Guardian.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_080.wav|So for me, even at the 11th hour, I'm doing no predicting.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_081.wav|I'm the man who on the first Tuesday in November 1948, the very morning of a presidential election, had a piece in the Guardian, a big piece on the leader page.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_082.wav|It was called Harry S. Truman, portrait of a failure.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_083.wav|24 hours later, the failure went roaring back into the White House.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_084.wav|And as for British elections, in June 1970, I telephoned a friend in England and said,
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_085.wav|Put 10 pounds for me on the conservatives.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_086.wav|My dear friend, he replied, You don't know what you're doing. It's going to be a labor landslide.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_087.wav|The odds are about 7 to 1.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_088.wav|Put 10 pounds on Heath, I said.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_089.wav|Of course I was an ignoramus, taking a flyer.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_090.wav|Next day I called him, crowing down the line.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_091.wav|70 pounds, I believe.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_092.wav|Dear Alistair, he said,
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_093.wav|What am I to say?
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_094.wav|I simply didn't want you to throw your money away.
wavs/cooke_1983-06-10_095.wav|I didn't place the bid.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_001.wav|in the presidential election of 1916, the Democrats did what the party who his man is in the White House always does, it re-inominated the incumbent.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_002.wav|He was President Wilson.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_003.wav|The Republicans chose an associate justice of the Supreme Court, one Charles Evans Hughes, a graceful, bearded man with a striking resemblance to God as he was perceived in those days.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_004.wav|Apart from his presidential physique, Hughes appeared to have united his own party and the progressives in a suspicion that Woodrow Wilson was preparing the country to enter the First World War.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_005.wav|On election night, when the word came in that Hughes had carried the two most popular states, New York and Pennsylvania, and Indiana, the bell-weather of the Midwestern vote, it was clear that he'd been elected.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_006.wav|Wilson went to bed, a defeated man, and next day he began to make the necessary arrangements for the transition transfer of power.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_007.wav|True, California had not been heard from, but California was not in those days the giant of the Electoral College.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_008.wav|Two nights later, shortly after midnight, the telephone rang in the home of Justice Hughes.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_009.wav|It was a news agency reporter wanting to speak to the justice.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_010.wav|A sleepy butler answered, I'm sorry sir, the President has gone to bed.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_011.wav|Said the reporter, well, wake him up and tell him he's not President anymore.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_012.wav|It was true, California had gone for Wilson and tipped the scale.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_013.wav|It took three days, though, to be sure of it.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_014.wav|Last Tuesday evening, at a quarter to six, three hours before the polls had closed in California, the telephone rang in Mr. Reagan's house in Pacific Palisades, a lush, movie star colony that lies between Beverly Hills and the Pacific Ocean.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_015.wav|The call came from President Carter.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_016.wav|He was calling to concede defeat and congratulate Ronald Reagan on a fine victory.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_017.wav|How could this be?
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_018.wav|Before the polls had closed in most western states and several in the Midwest, Luizas always grind their teeth and weight and weight usually until the early hours of Wednesday.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_019.wav|But Jimmy Carter with one dying kick set up one new record.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_020.wav|No presidential loser has ever conceded so early.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_021.wav|Of course, the states don't report their vote as a whole.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_022.wav|It's the election district, the hundreds of them within a state that make their tally separately.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_023.wav|And in the cities especially where the mechanical voting machine is long established and accumulates the total as it goes, the votes of even very popular districts can be delivered within minutes of the polling deadline.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_024.wav|This nearly universal device would not, however, be enough to tell us on the basis say of five percent of a state's vote who had carried that state.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_025.wav|But for over 30 years now we've been living in the age of what we first called the big brain and now called the computer.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_026.wav|I remember many years ago going into Midtown Manhattan to look at IBM's first demonstration model of the big brain, an electronic marvel, an enormous room with winking lights and walls riddled with looping wires, an electronic spaghetti factory.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_027.wav|Today the Japanese have reduced these marvels to the size of a fingernail.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_028.wav|Put together the voting machine and the computer and plug them into a television network and you have a lightning reporter who can be guaranteed to short circuit the suspense that used to keep us on a knife edge of anxiety through the long evenings and the nights of the first Tuesday in November.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_029.wav|Last Tuesday night was unreal.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_030.wav|You have friends in for a drink or two in time to hear the seven o'clock news which on presidential election nights starts the nonstop coverage of the networks.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_031.wav|Normally for many years the seven o'clock news provided one unchanging item that produced a ribbled joke or two about the networks with all their electronic gear and their maps and their experts dripping expertise.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_032.wav|Seven o'clock strikes and this mountainous organization groans and delivers a mouse.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_033.wav|The first return always from the same village in New Hampshire, total vote 11.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_034.wav|I remember in 1948 the Ancomand saying eight votes for Dewey, three for Truman.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_035.wav|Well there it is but I guess you could hardly call it a trend.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_036.wav|As that we would all chuckle through the delivery of several other mice and go into dinner and come back about ten o'clock when you could begin to get some idea of how the eastern states had gone and the Midwest was going.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_037.wav|Not last Tuesday.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_038.wav|NBC which admittedly was a bolder profit than its rivals maybe its big brain is bigger or more audacious.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_039.wav|NBC positively gave Florida to Reagan within 15 minutes of the start of the program.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_040.wav|On the basis of 10% of the vote in a crucial county here and 5% of a divided city there NBC was announcing at 7.30 that Ronald Reagan was going to have a very considerable victory.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_041.wav|They switched to their reporter at the White House and it might have been Wednesday noon.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_042.wav|She reported bleak faces, the president's aides looking for lawnly at their cluttered desks and one or two of the Carter family close to tears.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_043.wav|A few minutes later a couple of our friends arrived and the man said can we still have dinner?
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_044.wav|Before we'd finished dinner a brave chair went up from the telly and there was Jimmy Carter telling us he'd called Governor Reagan and promising us the smoothest transition from one administration to another in the history of the presidency.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_045.wav|All that happened then was the rapid and unhindered movement of the landslide.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_046.wav|First in the south then through the Midwest then into the northeast and finally across the West to make the map one sheet of uniform blue.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_047.wav|A week ago it seemed to some of us though that was no time for me to say so that the so-called presidential debate had given the last flick of the whip to a Reagan who sprint in the last stretch was unapproachable.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_048.wav|If in the famous first debate in 1960 John Kennedy looked like a knowledgeable choir boy and Richard Nixon like Boris Karloff.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_049.wav|In the 1980 debate it seemed to me Ronald Reagan looked like an affable salesman and Jimmy Carter like a nervous iceberg.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_050.wav|May not seem like much of a choice for the leader of the free world but one fact we have to face from now on is that the television image of two political opponents is not a human reflection of two political positions.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_051.wav|It's a show all in itself like a studio photograph of a bride or the commissioned portrait of a university president or a bank manager.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_052.wav|It's undoubtedly meant to be the man himself but he's tamed and tailored by the medium into a performer.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_053.wav|From this limited and theatrical view of the two candidates we did not see anything in Jimmy Carter that we had not seen a thousand times.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_054.wav|He was grave, judicial, verbose in a technical way, he licked his lips, he trusted as a debater to misreading some of Mr. Reagan's acts as governor of California and he kept on calling him dangerous.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_055.wav|But then we'd look across to Mr. Reagan who is a professional, a professional good guy in front of a camera and the last thing he appeared was dangerous.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_056.wav|He appeared engaging, good humid, his brow wrinkled, sorrowfully at Mr. Carter's misinterpretations.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_057.wav|He recited in the idiom of ordinary American speech his devotion to peace, to the workers, to the families of America, he longed for the old days of decent folk and lots of jobs.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_058.wav|And he clinched this simple appeal to half the population with the sunny but deadly question,

wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_060.wav|Do you think America is stronger than it was four years ago?
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_061.wav|Simple, artful and if you like unfair appeals, for nobody's better off and nobody maintains that America has, for the past twenty years, let alone the past four, made any show of strength that has impressed the world.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_062.wav|But these two questions turned out to be right on target.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_063.wav|For last used in night NBC undertook a novelty, what it called an exit poll.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_064.wav|They set up many thousands of interviews with people across the country, people leaving the polls in election districts statistically chosen as a cross section of the people's mood.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_065.wav|Voters were simply asked what issues had forced them to vote the way they did.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_066.wav|Overwhelmingly, the answer was two issues, the state of the economy, which means inflation, unemployment, the cost of housing, and the fear that America is not as militarily strong as it ought to be.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_067.wav|Now these issues of course concern politicians of all stripes, not least Jimic Carter.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_068.wav|And most people I think know in their bones that nobody, except perhaps the West Germans and the Japanese, seemed to be able to stop inflation.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_069.wav|Why then should Jimic Carter have to take the blame?
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_070.wav|First, a simple reason, but one loftily overlooked by election pundits, Jimic Carter is in the position of the president, but what emphasized his incumbency was nobody but Jimic Carter himself.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_071.wav|Instead of doing what Franklin Roosevelt did in four elections, never mentioning the name of his opponent, he decided to make Ronald Reagan and his character the issue, the tactic backfired.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_072.wav|The actual sight of Reagan in the debate obliterated the nuclear button pressing Dr. Strangelove of Mr. Carter's fancy.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_073.wav|This is a well-known and fatal tactic in courtroom trials.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_074.wav|When the prosecutor paints two gordier picture of the defendant as villain and the defendant sits there looking inoffensive, the jury starts to grow suspicious of the plaintiff, the man who's doing all this frantic finger pointing.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_075.wav|And in the end, all the bewildering complexity of the issues that were no more than touched on and the great array of issues and solutions that were never mentioned, all of them in the end, I believe, came to focus on the human image of Jimic Carter.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_076.wav|He is the curator of the mess we're in, if that's what we're in.
wavs/cooke_1980-11-06_077.wav|And maybe the country said we should hand the ball to the conservatives who've been moaning and groaning since 1964 and goldwater's defeat about the bankruptcy of liberal Democrats and big government.

wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_001.wav|good morning.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_002.wav|Firestorm is a colorful word, a metaphor.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_003.wav|And like most colorful words, it's overused by journalists and politicians.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_004.wav|But for once it would be correct to say that figuratively speaking, Washington, last Monday morning, was engulfed by a political firestorm.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_005.wav|A firestorm is literally defined as a fire started by a bomb that intensifies and spreads across the landscape by the in-rushing winds created by the strong draft of rising hot air.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_006.wav|Well, Monday morning in Washington was comparatively calm and bright.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_007.wav|The big, the hotening topic over the weekend was Mr. Gorbachev's response to President Bush's moves towards nuclear disarmament.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_008.wav|The newest from the United Nations inspectors in Iraq made many people who'd been hot for sanctions against Saddam but cold about fighting him, changed their minds, shuddering in hindsight at the thought of sanctions going on for years while Saddam developed an atomic and a hydrogen bomb arsenal.

wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_010.wav|And President Bush, having heard some nasty things about the civil rights abuses of Haiti's exiled president, declared that his return to power was no longer to be considered the same thing as restoring democracy.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_011.wav|And then, some time before noon, a very small bomb exploded way off in the southwest in Norman, Oklahoma, a town so far unknown to worldwide fame, though the University of Oklahoma founded there is about to celebrate its hundredth anniversary.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_012.wav|And it was on the campus of the University that the bomb dropped.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_013.wav|Since it was dropped on television, it took no more than half an hour for the shock waves to be felt everywhere and the rising hot air of indignation from women's groups to set the shocking topic ablaze throughout Washington.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_014.wav|The Senate abandoned its normal business, government departments pretended to work as usual, ordinary people across the continent from presidents of corporations to moral players and truck drivers looked for the nearest television set or cut short their day and hurried home.

wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_017.wav|Well, now time to identify the dropper of the bomb.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_018.wav|A very unlikely terrorist, a pretty young black woman 35 years of age, a professor, a professor of law, no less, at the University.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_019.wav|She called the press conference and surprisingly the room was packed with the media.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_020.wav|Now, what was the word that had got them there?
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_021.wav|Well, you've all heard of public television, the National Network, non-commercial television network.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_022.wav|There is a parallel public radio network and it has without question the best radio news in the country.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_023.wav|And on Monday morning, it carried a bullet into the effect that this woman, law professor Amis Anita Hill had charged Judge Clarence Thomas with sexual harassment.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_024.wav|Judge Thomas is the 43 year old black man, judge on a federal appeals court, who is the president's choice to succeed a retiring justice on the Supreme Court.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_025.wav|And in accordance with the now well-established custom, he appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee for five days.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_026.wav|He was followed by witnesses for another nine days, distinguished people, unknown people, experts, friends, lawyers, some for him, some against him.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_027.wav|Few nominees I can remember have had such a thorough, almost pitiless going over by the Senate Committee that's required to question all presidential appointees as judges, that is.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_028.wav|The Committee of 14 then votes to approve or reject the nominee and pass its verdict onto the whole Senate.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_029.wav|Whatever the verdict is, the 100 members of the Senate then vote and a simple majority either way will confirm or reject the president's choice.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_030.wav|On Judge Thomas, the Committee wound up with a tied vote, seven to approve, seven to reject.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_031.wav|The ones against him, all Democrats, complained that the judge had renounced the opinion seat published in speeches and lectures, or that he revealed no principles at all, or that he was not sufficiently impressive as a legal scholar to be voted onto the Supreme Court.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_032.wav|The vote of the whole Senate was set for Tuesday, last Tuesday, October the 8th at 6pm.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_033.wav|But as I say the day before, Miss Anita Hill appeared in Norma, Oklahoma, and in Washington, political hell broke loose.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_034.wav|How had National Public Radio got the news of her charge?
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_035.wav|The leaker has not been positively identified, but as you'll see it was bound to come out.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_036.wav|In the beginning, another Senate Committee, the Labour Committee was on another matter, interviewing people who had worked for Judge Thomas and aimed to Senator Kennedy, who is on both committees, interviewed Miss Hill, that was on the 5th of September, and she was asked if there was any truth to rumors that at some time in the past, she'd been sexually harassed by Mr. Thomas, when he was head of the EEOC, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which is the government agency that looks into discrimination in the workplace, racial, sexual, ethnic, whatever.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_037.wav|So of course, the moment we heard Miss Hill's charge, the irony bloomed that the government's agent to police and punish discrimination of any kind should have been charged with of all things, sexual harassment.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_038.wav|At this point you may be anxious to know what exactly or vaguely is sexual harassment.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_039.wav|Well, that's the question, the answer to which we'll concern, baffle of frightened millions of American men, when this confrontation between Miss Hill and Judge Thomas is over and done with.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_040.wav|We're at the point where Miss Hill is being questioned by one of Senator Kennedy's staff, and she replies, apropos of the rumors he heard about sexual harassment when she worked for Mr. Thomas.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_041.wav|She doesn't want to go into it, she'd like to think it over, which she did.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_042.wav|She was then telephoned by some unidentified aide to a senator, some senator on the Judiciary Committee, and then she decided she would make a statement and sign it as an affidavit.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_043.wav|In it she said that way back there 10 years ago, she'd been sexually harassed by her boss, by which she meant.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_044.wav|She'd been invited out to dinner by Mr.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_045.wav|then, Thomas, and when she refused, he discussed sexual preferences with her and described or recounted pornographic movies that he'd seen.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_046.wav|That was all in the original complaint.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_047.wav|Miss Hill stressed that there'd been no attempt at physical contact, not even touching.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_048.wav|She also stressed that she'd not come forward on her own, but been called by the committee.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_049.wav|Miss Hill's statement was circulated among the members of the Judiciary Committee, and the chairman, Senator Biden, who of course is a Democrat, and the senior Republican Senator Thurmond agreed to have the FBI do a private investigation.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_050.wav|I say, of course, Senator Biden is a Democrat, to remind you that the Democrats are the majority party in the Senate as in the House, and therefore all committee chairman are Democrats.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_051.wav|Anyway, the FBI completed its report, which involved naturally talking to Judge Thomas and Miss Hill separately, and to any other people who might be relevant witnesses.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_052.wav|By the way, when Miss Hill made her affidavit, she asked that the whole matter be kept confidential, that her name be kept secret that Judge Thomas should not be told.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_053.wav|Well, pretty soon several senators reminded her, the law professor remember, that under the law an accused person has the right to know the accusation and the name of the accuser.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_054.wav|So that's how the whole thing eventually got out.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_055.wav|The Judiciary Committee had spent over two weeks publicly hearing legal and other relevant testimony about Judge Thomas, and also in private wondering what to do with Miss Hill's affidavit in the FBI's report.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_056.wav|Fatally, they decided to keep an underlock in key, and the vote on Judge Thomas went forward, seven, four, seven against.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_057.wav|Then the vote went on to the whole Senate, which, as I say, was to vote in all innocents so far as the sexual charge was concerned, last year's the evening.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_058.wav|I just said fatally, once the word was out on National Public Radio, and then in every other news medium, the firestorm across the country was caused by the in-rushing indignation of women and women's groups of every sort, lawyers, feminists, nurses, office workers, unions, housewives, columnists.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_059.wav|The senators on the committee were by this Friday, getting as many as 3,000 letters a day each.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_060.wav|In print on the radio, on television, the Senate, the whole Senate was being forcibly bitterly sarcastically reminded that the Senate consists of 98 males and two females, both of whom joined in the lamenting chorus, that 42% of women working for the government declared in a hasty poll that at some time or other they'd been similarly victimized,

wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_062.wav|Miss Hill gave that, as the reason for waiting 10 years before speaking out.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_063.wav|The Senate, and I guess the rest of the male population, was also reminded by a regiment of women lawyers, that more than 50% of the people who vote in this country are women, and that sexual harassment under a law passed in 1964 and refined three years ago can entail anything from rape to certain forms of flirtation, from quote unwelcomed advances to creating by word or deed for the victim quote a hostile environment.
wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_064.wav|The Senate vote for and against Judge Thomas was now a wash in uncertainty, so the Senate agreed to put it off for a week till next Tuesday.

wavs/cooke_1991-10-11_066.wav|That is the background story that led us, us being by calculation, more than half the population, to sit and settle down for the weekend hearings for what is historically the first big governmental effort to define for the public what is meant by sexual harassment.

wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_007.wav|Swift contributed a damning suggestion in a famous pamphlet, which was called a modest proposal for preventing the children of poor people from being a burden to their parents and to the country.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_008.wav|His modest proposal was simply that they should be fattened and eaten.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_009.wav|Now 200 years ago, satirists of this quality ran a constant risk of imprisonment on no other grounds than that they had offended the government in power.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_010.wav|Today, in spite of a general howl on both sides of the Atlantic about the rush to curtail our liberties, we certainly, it seems to me, have more freedom to spout any opinions at all, even to spouting the need to kill your parents if you consider them to be bourgeois fascists.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_011.wav|More freedom, I should say, than any two self-governing people have ever had in history.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_012.wav|Art Buckwald, a name I hope is now to you, has been called the modern Dean Swift by no less than intellect than Mr. Dean Atchison, the former Secretary of State to President Truman, who even in his late 70s continues to look like a Spanish grandee in the full prime of his powers.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_013.wav|Mr. Atchison does not exaggerate.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_014.wav|Art Buckwald is a small, chunky, roly-poly man of swarthy complexion, black hair and eyes, glasses like goggles, and a sort of cocky, rolling gate, like a sailor just come ashore and up to no good.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_015.wav|Mr. Buckwald came to our attention in the years after the war when his paper sent him to Paris, and he wrote a column whose line was that of a latter-day Mark Twain, an American innocent abroad.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_016.wav|But like Mark Twain, Buckwald was very far from an innocent, but he had hit on a humorous device of pretended innocence and bewilderment, which at one at the same time satirized both the American in Europe and the Europeans themselves.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_017.wav|This has been a fairly constant vein of American humor.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_018.wav|I remember Mark Twain, for instance, saying that the English were quite right not to have a laundry delivery service because your shirt was so starched that it walked back into your hotel room unated.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_019.wav|And there was Will Rogers, the old cowboy innocent.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_020.wav|He was another at the height of his fame, which was, I suppose, in the 1920s.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_021.wav|He was invited by the then Prince of Wales, the present Duke of Windsor, to go to Lodz and watch a cricket match.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_022.wav|Rogers saw the players eat a large and nourishing breakfast, and then get down to business about 10-30 in the morning.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_023.wav|He was just beginning to pick up the elements of the game when the players walked off the field, and he wondered what had happened, and he was told it was the lunch interval.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_024.wav|To an American, a game is the furious contest, if not a bloody battle, and the sight of an American football or baseball team going off the field for refreshment.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_025.wav|Well, it would not be more surprising than the men in the Normandy invasion pausing on the French coast to have a hot dog and a coke.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_026.wav|However, Will Rogers settled down again to his cricket lesson at about 2.15, and then at 4.15 he was astonished to see the players walk off again.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_027.wav|It was, of course, the tea interval.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_028.wav|When the day was over, the Prince of Wales asked him what he thought about the game.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_029.wav|He replied, Your Highness, I think it's just fine, but if I were in charge, I'd line them all up before the game began and say, Now listen, fellas, no food till you through.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_030.wav|Well, Art Bacquole for many years had a glorious fun with the French and with himself as a supposedly and permanently bewildered American abroad.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_031.wav|Then his paper switched his assignment to Washington.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_032.wav|Everybody with any experience of daily journalism knew at once that it was a mistake.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_033.wav|It may be alright for powerful authors like Ernest Hemingway to say, find out what you can do and then do something else.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_034.wav|But most first-rate journalists do one thing very well, and I think should devote themselves till the brain gives out, trying to do it supremely well.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_035.wav|You know what happened?
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_036.wav|Bacquole took a month or two to get the feel of Washington and the complexities of the political system.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_037.wav|And then he was better than ever.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_038.wav|He has the acutist sense of irony and a gift for quite simple comic ideas which he then writes straight without any verbal decorations and adjectival-folderals, the very opposite of high-brow wit.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_039.wav|It was Bacquole, who first suggested, oh three, four years ago, that the way to end the Vietnam War was simply to declare that the United States had won proclaim a victory celebration and bring the boys home to the of happy bands.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_040.wav|I don't know how long it was after the Second War, 10, possibly a dozen years, I should guess, that he wrote a column containing his own modest proposal to bail Britain out of her recurring money crises and to save the United States the periodic embarrassment of having to put up the cash.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_041.wav|What we should both do, he said, was to contrive as soon as possible World War Three and arrange to lose it.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_042.wav|That way, supposing we were fighting the Russians, they would then put up the money to reconstruct our entire industrial plant, which they destroyed along the most modern lines and they would advance the loans or the outright gifts and send us productivity teams to teach us how to out-produce them.

wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_045.wav|Mr. Nixon's 10% surcharge on imports has dealt a blow to the Japanese, which is at once an open embarrassment and a secret relief to American businessmen.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_046.wav|We've all weakened up too late to the fact that the Japanese were not merely constructing a co-prosperity sphere in Asia, but a Japanese prosperity sphere of the entire globe.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_047.wav|In the guileless years, a decade or so ago, we all found ourselves buying small, beautifully designed little radios of Japanese manufacturer and then television sets.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_048.wav|And saying to ourselves in a still comfortably condescending way, smart cookies, those Japanese, today there are full-blood-in American patriots who could go through their kitchen and their living room and their garage and find that most of the products they need and use are either Japanese imports or are assembled in the United States from Japanese blueprints.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_049.wav|Ten years ago, I went down to West Virginia to watch the making of a movie about John Brown, the liberationist who armed Negro slaves was captured at Harpers Ferry and executed.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_050.wav|He's the same John Brown, who so they say, goes marching on.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_051.wav|Harpers Ferry is now a compulsory tourist stop and attached to the inn.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_052.wav|There's a souvenir shop.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_053.wav|I remember picking up a tiny gun and a Confederate hat, looking at them casually and seeing printed on them.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_054.wav|What is, by the way, printed on the decorative ash trays used on all American aircraft carriers made in Japan.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_055.wav|So even then, the Japanese had taken out a patent on American history, both ancient and modern.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_056.wav|Well, we were astounded to hear three weeks ago that the United States takes over 30 percent of all Japan's huge manufacturing industry.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_057.wav|Nobody needs to be told also that Germany is the second most prosperous nation.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_058.wav|No wonder I got the answer I did at a lecture before a California university audience a year or two ago.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_059.wav|When I asked the assembled students which were our most dependable allies in the Second War, something that was over about five years before they were born, in a flash, a bright boy stood up and said,
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_060.wav|Germany and Japan.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_061.wav|And he wasn't being funny.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_062.wav|It was an honest slip, but as profound as all such spontaneous slips are.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_063.wav|Well, now Mr. Buckwald has written another column about the recent visit to China of one of the most distinguished, possibly the most influential of American journalists, Mr. James Reston of the New York Times.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_064.wav|Mr. Reston had no sooner arrived in Peking.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_065.wav|This is the fact, not Buckwald's invention.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_066.wav|Then he was seized with appendicitis and he was whipped off to hospital and had it out.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_067.wav|The name of the hospital is the anti-imperialist hospital.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_068.wav|It does not require any cynicism at all to guess that Mr. Reston was treated as tenderly as Chairman Mao himself would be if he fell into the hands of his own medical butchers.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_069.wav|Mr. Reston wrote several ecstatic pieces about the technical skill, the meticulous nursing care, the kindness and general charm and dedication of the hospital staff for which we should all be grateful.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_070.wav|He was restored to the outer world in fine shape and such high good humour that his enthusiasm for Chinese medicine extended over several weeks to the people and the system.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_071.wav|It's not unkind, I think, to suggest that Mr. Reston was given the full, interiorist treatment.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_072.wav|His pieces brought balm to the souls of American liberals who begin to believe that the Chinese are, after all probably, just American Puritans three centuries later.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_073.wav|It also brought great iron to the souls of the Republicans and conservatives.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_074.wav|Mr. Buckwald, as usual, knew precisely what had happened to Mr. Reston and gave us cause to forgive him.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_075.wav|The Chinese surgeons, Mr. Buckwald said, had inserted in Mr. Reston's stomach a tiny tape machine which whenever Mr. Reston was inclined to make nasty bourgeois comments on communist China would cause him involuntarily to recite the thoughts of Chairman Mao.
wavs/cooke_1971-07-10_076.wav|This explanation has released a gale of happy laughter in Mr. Reston's critics, dissolved their bile, absolved Mr. Reston of all charges of fellow travelling and made us grateful yet again for the healing wit of Art Buckwald.

wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_002.wav|For nobody, except North Vietnam is jubilant.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_003.wav|Her chief negotiator, Laduk Toh, said it is a very great victory for the Vietnamese people and if you qualify that to read for the North Vietnamese, the Viet Cong and the Soviet Union, he's undoubtedly right.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_004.wav|All that President Toh could do was to make the kind of chin-up speech that leaders do who are unsure of their jobs and fear the worst.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_005.wav|He broadcast for 40 minutes to the people of South Vietnam and tried to tell them not to take one but that they had nobly withstood a kind of Lenin grad.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_006.wav|After 18 years of savage fighting he said the Communists have been forced to stop the conflict, our people have truly destroyed the Communist troops that have come from the North and we have valiantly fought the forces that are in the South.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_007.wav|The Communists have been forced to recognize two Vietnam's.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_008.wav|Well have they?
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_009.wav|President Nixon said the settlement has the full support of President Toh and his government which could be an interesting play on words.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_010.wav|Apparently there was not much else that Toh could do.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_011.wav|In the first agreement which nearly came off in October, Toh absolutely refused to leave his own government to whatever fate the North Vietnamese might decide.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_012.wav|He wanted it put down on paper that North Vietnam would let Toh and his government stay in power until an election.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_013.wav|This it seems is something that the North Vietnamese absolutely refused to do.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_014.wav|Hence President Nixon's supporters say the sudden outburst of bombing in North Vietnam.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_015.wav|If this was the reason for it no wonder Mr. Nixon gave no explanation to the Congress or the people beyond the doggy assurance of the Pentagon press officer that the bombing was restricted to military targets.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_016.wav|We know of course that whether on orders or by accident the bombing did some ruinous damage inside Hanoi.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_017.wav|And it's arguable that Mr. Nixon acted after being confronted in miniature with Mr. Truman's problem over the use of the first atomic bomb.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_018.wav|As to say the enemy said no no cease fire.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_019.wav|As the Japanese said no no surrender.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_020.wav|The alternatives with Japan were to continue the air and ground war and maybe lose half million or one or two million men by invading the Japanese islands or bomb the Japanese into surrender with that new and terrible weapon.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_021.wav|And to put it bloodlessly it worked.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_022.wav|Mr. Nixon evidently decided to bomb North Vietnam back to the negotiating table and it worked.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_023.wav|He must have recalled the equally interminable and weirous some negotiations with the Chinese and the North Koreans 20 years ago.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_024.wav|President Eisenhower, like Mr. Nixon, came into the White House on a promise to end the war.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_025.wav|Eisenhower eventually came to the end of his patience with the communists, Chinese torture form of negotiation, which we have seen in a polliter but no less tedious form at the United Nations.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_026.wav|A form of nitpicking, tea-crossing, hair-splitting examination of every word and letter performed with tireless, poker-faced patience interrupted at long intervals by outbursts of righteous indignation and war cuts.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_027.wav|Well, after months and months, Eisenhower threatened the communists with the use of tactical atomic weapons and they came back to the table and signed.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_028.wav|And so now have the North Vietnamese having promised to respect the South Vietnamese people's right to self-determination while leaving President Tuyen office.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_029.wav|Now this has been said in other countries before and once having been said it has been ignored or violated.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_030.wav|The North Vietnamese we are told are now seeking to set up their own capital in the South, which does not bode well for President Tuyen's self-determination or his survival.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_031.wav|While Leduc Tau was hailing what he called a moment of joy and President Nixon was telling us that President Tuyen gives everything his full support, President Tuyen himself was telling his people this is only a ceasefire agreement not more or less.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_032.wav|In the days to come we'll see if the communists will observe the agreement.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_033.wav|His skepticism is surely well-founded, not merely on the fact that he's the head of a government from which the United States will now withdraw all its armed support.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_034.wav|He would simply have to be like a friend of mine, a man who has made a hobby of reading signed communist agreements from Yalta to Korea.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_035.wav|And even if the communists proceed in their usual manner first to promise free elections and self-determination and then to go ahead on the assumption that no such promise has been given even if the usual script is followed.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_036.wav|The Vietnam agreement expects an awful lot of goodwill on the part of two commissions it has set up.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_037.wav|The first is the International Commission which is meant to supervise the release of prisoners, troop withdrawals and elections.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_038.wav|This commission has a force so-called of only 1160 men with troops from four nations, Canada, Hungary, Indonesia and Poland.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_039.wav|One you investigate and report violations of the prisoner exchange, the troop withdrawals and the elections.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_040.wav|And this commission consists of forces from the United States, South Vietnam, North Vietnam and the Vietnam Kong.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_041.wav|So that is a standoff of two from each side.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_042.wav|I don't know precisely how many free elections have ever been held in countries occupied by the communists since the Second World War but the answer depends on what you mean by free.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_043.wav|In all the communist elections I can recall the people are free to give 99.9% of their votes to one man.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_044.wav|It is true that 18 years ago in Southeast Asia the United States jibbed at holding free elections from the fear that the communists would win them.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_045.wav|And this may have been a first-class political era but the fear was well taken.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_046.wav|I should hate to be a reporter with those 1160 men scattered all over Vietnam trying or pretending to say whose forces jumped on a village after the ceasefire, who crossed the demilitarized zone and why, how many troops and who's have retreated into Laos and one of the two.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_047.wav|Whether the mayor of this town and his buddies are truly North Vietnamese regulars or South Vietnamese who decided to see the light and switch sides as a patrol of Indonesian, Hungarian and Polish troops approaches.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_048.wav|I shouldn't care to be a North Vietnamese on the military commission conscientiously reporting to the International Commission violations committed by the North Vietnamese.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_049.wav|Now the words what's required of these two commissions is a scrupulous and high-minded performance of their duty worthy of the Supreme Court and 11 of the 12 disciples.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_050.wav|In the hope that they will so perform, let us pray.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_051.wav|Talking of the Supreme Court last week it brought great grief to the leaders of the Catholic Church and great joy to a lot of other people with a sweeping decision which overruled the laws of every state that prohibits or restricts the right of any woman to have an abortion during the first three months of pregnancy.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_052.wav|Since the whole controversy started about who owns a woman's body, who has the right to stifle a new life, whether or not a beginning fetus is indeed alive at all.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_053.wav|Since then 46 states of past laws of varying degrees of permissiveness and prohibition.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_054.wav|Many state legislatures only just assembled for a new session were drafting bills either to prohibit abortion at different stages of pregnancy or to permit it or to set up all sorts of restrictions that would allow abortion but prevent some big city becoming a free abortion mill or, and this is problem in most big cities, straining the regular medical services with queues of women asking or getting abortion on demand.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_055.wav|The New York state legislature was priming itself for another big debate to abolish or rewrite its permissive abortion law which passed last year by only one vote.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_056.wav|Well the Supreme Court has now frustrated or squashed these plans and bills and debates and it laid down a very precise definition extending through the nine months of pregnancy of a woman's constitutional rights in the matter of having a baby or not having a baby.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_057.wav|From now on no state may interfere in the first three months with the judgment of a woman and her doctor as to whether she shall be aborted.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_058.wav|During the next six months of pregnancy a state has the right to interfere but only to guarantee the woman's physical or mental health by setting standards licensing and such for the people who perform the abortion.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_059.wav|In the last ten weeks when a fetus is normally self-sustaining that's to say has become a life that would survive normally.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_060.wav|A state may prohibit abortion unless there is approved hazard to the health or life of the mother.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_061.wav|If this is a judgment of what is loosely called Mr. Nixon's new conservative court and three of Mr. Nixon's nominees vote him for it while Mr. Nixon himself has steadily expressed his antagonism to voluntary abortion then it's a judgment that's going to take a long time to overturn.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_062.wav|Yet again we have seen men appointed to the court to express the strength of the president's convictions and they have seen themselves independent for life of the president and the voters and of wage slavery and have expressed their own convictions.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_063.wav|And now what have we left for Lyndon Johnson who dropped dead on Monday?
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_064.wav|What can I say that I have not said many times about a president who stature I believe was crippled by Vietnam and whose humanity was soured by his country manners.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_065.wav|He carried the social revolution of Franklin Roosevelt beyond Roosevelt's imagining.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_066.wav|He took the promises that John Kennedy bravely recited and turned them into 95 laws.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_067.wav|He redeemed the mediocre second term of Eisenhower by forcing through the Congress the first civil rights bill in a hundred years.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_068.wav|And once in the White House he remained one powerful and salty southerner absolutely converted to the vision of black people eating, riding, voting, schooling, working, teaching, living as they had never done before.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_069.wav|He brought on the racial turmoil by showing the shameful gap between America's preaching and America's practice.
wavs/cooke_1973-01-27_070.wav|And history will raise him, I believe, far above our present judgment of him.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_001.wav|good morning, maybe you've heard that this letter marks a special occasion for a series of talks that started 50 years ago this Sunday.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_002.wav|Somebody had the odd idea that I should repeat the very first talk, I looked it over and it seemed a happy idea.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_003.wav|So here it is.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_004.wav|But I think I ought to fill in a background, the dark, bleak background of Britain in early 1946, otherwise you'll wonder at the obsession in this talk with food and clothing and food and the desperate ways of procuring them.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_005.wav|In Britain, the winter of 1945-06 was the hardest to bear of any of the war years, not only because of ferocious weather, but because during the war the American government under President Roosevelt's prodding had voted to send to Britain millions of tons of food and billions of dollars in loans to finance the making of all the weapons of war.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_006.wav|But the day after the Japanese surrendered in August 1945 and the whole Second War was over, President Truman suspended all this so-called lend lease aid.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_007.wav|So Britain, already bankrupted of its own resources, was now deprived of the American helping hand.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_008.wav|My trip over to London to set up this new series of non-war talks was frankly a shocker.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_009.wav|Waterloo station, where I came in from the boat train, was as dark as a catacombe.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_010.wav|There was everywhere a dire shortage of heat and electricity, coal, food, soap was a luxury.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_011.wav|Napkins at meals, long forgotten, shoes worn thin, worn through.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_012.wav|And a usually dapper friend of mine sat next to me the first evening, raised his index finger and ran it reverently down the crease in my trousers.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_013.wav|He said, I haven't seen that for five years.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_014.wav|Well now, purged of the obsessive detail about food and clothing which would today drive you mad, here is the body of that first talk.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_015.wav|Oh, by the way, a GI bride was a British girl who had married an American soldier while he was camped in Britain.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_016.wav|I want to tell you what it's like to come back to the United States after a sobering month in Britain and say what daily life feels and looks like by comparison.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_017.wav|I sailed back on the Queen Mary with a couple of thousand GI brides and I recall now the great liner thundering its great horn as we slipped away from the dock at Southampton.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_018.wav|All the mothers were clinging to the rail and all the babies were clinging to their mothers along the entire curving length of the ship's main deck.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_019.wav|The handkerchiefs fluttered in an unbroken line like Washington, Manchester.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_020.wav|And then a small coast guard cut a scutted along like a playful puppy.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_021.wav|A sailor stood at the cutters bow, he cupped his hands and yelled, you wouldn't like to come back with you and the young mothers and wives weeping like mad yelled, no!
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_022.wav|The ship turned about, we headed into the channel, England faded into the night and we all went below.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_023.wav|For the brides who just done dabbing their eyes, there was a first small shock of Americana.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_024.wav|A meal with meat and a veg double not easily recognizable.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_025.wav|No wonder it was not Brussels sprouts.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_026.wav|It was a cooked mixture of limer beans and corn, translation maize, an American Indian favorite christened by them, succotash.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_027.wav|At the breakfast, next day there were eggs and bacon and sausage patties and pancakes and maple syrup.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_028.wav|The butter was fresh and plentiful and the oranges were to take away.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_029.wav|This went on for five days and it struck me by the second day out that few iron-as-of-peace can be so delicate as the sight of GI brides comparatively famished for five years, refusing most of these goodies, not because of just the rolling wave, but because their stomachs over five years had shrunk.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_030.wav|Towards the late afternoon of the fifth day we were moving slowly up New York Harbor and slowly out of the mist rose the towering cluster of the downtown skyscrapers, crowned with the small cloud of smoke and fog.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_031.wav|Some bright girl wondered why they should be when all around was blue water and the sparkling sky.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_032.wav|It was the first reminder of New York as in a minor way a war casualty.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_033.wav|Before the war, Manhattan was a sparkling island both by day and by night, because the city had a law forbidding the burning of soft coal anywhere for more than ten minutes today.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_034.wav|But in 1940 when neighboring factories turned into war factories for 24 hours a day the law was suspended and it's never been put back.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_035.wav|By now a whole fleet of little freighters and tugs were piping out as we rode by and from time to time the Queen Mary terrified the children by roaring back three thunderous blasts.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_036.wav|Especially charted ferryboat, tagging along by our side, played jazzed up versions of why did I kiss that girl and here comes the bride.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_037.wav|The captains of the tugboats would look sky high and wave at the brides and soon we saw great signs painted on piers and docks, welcome home and well done.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_038.wav|A soldier friend of mine told me of the lump that came in his throat when he heard the bands and saw the signs.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_039.wav|Full of pride and bounds he went down the gang plank to meet New York and its grateful citizens.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_040.wav|He was far from home and he started to look for a hotel room.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_041.wav|Nothing had been built during the war and the hotels were crammed.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_042.wav|Then he looked for just a room anywhere.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_043.wav|He wound up by begging a man who ran a Turkish bath for a sheet just for the night.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_044.wav|It was his due a fame for a job well done.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_045.wav|I soon noticed other floors in everyday life that only a month before I'd taken for granted as the war had worn on.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_046.wav|The taxi that took me home had one door tied with string and that evening in another cab the driver couldn't use his first gear which had given up shortly before VE day.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_047.wav|He also couldn't go in reverse so if he scuttled past your destination he had to drive around the block again to land just right.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_048.wav|This is a useful money making device I offer without fee or patent.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_049.wav|Next morning outside my office was a long queue about 80 yards long.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_050.wav|Most live women as sprinkling of men shifting a little guilty from foot to foot.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_051.wav|It was a queue for nylon stockings.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_052.wav|Well by now there are in theory enough nylons to provide most women with a single pair.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_053.wav|A promise that signals what might be called operation greed.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_054.wav|People get afraid they'll miss their assigned pair of stockings.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_055.wav|So a woman queues up for one pair and her husband nonchalantly disguised for another.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_056.wav|Need I say there are also in these queues smooth looking gents and crummy looking youths with fake ration certificates who have no personal use for nylons and no wife or girlfriend to be a hero for.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_057.wav|They're just doing the rounds of the queues by way of running their own modest black market.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_058.wav|Nylons are not a unique case since I got back here.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_059.wav|I've only once had butter offered to me in a restaurant.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_060.wav|But here again and I mean over here a wholesaler who serves any big city.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_061.wav|Here's there's going to be say a shortage of butter.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_062.wav|Maybe only for a few days but the black market if it's to keep its custom can't depend on a long shortage.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_063.wav|So it corners the market and jacks up the price.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_064.wav|The big hotels and the restaurants are reluctant participants in this game.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_065.wav|They can't afford to go two days without butter.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_066.wav|So they're thinking of the prosperous peacetime patronage to come.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_067.wav|They lay in extra supplies, pay more for them and in the end everybody is the loser.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_068.wav|And now the city fathers tell us that worse is to come soon we'll be eating brown bread.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_069.wav|The fact that brown bread which preserves the wheat kernel, the whole grain is far more nutritious than the white bread that has been bleached of it, is not over publicized.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_070.wav|In both countries it seems white bread has for a very long time been thought tonia.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_071.wav|So now what?
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_072.wav|Good housewives rush around buying up stacks of white flour which in turn produces a flour shortage.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_073.wav|This panic is basically a fear in a land of plenty that you may go short and become help like Europe.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_074.wav|The fear was very lively during the war.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_075.wav|The consequence was that Americans consumed more meat than ever before in their history.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_076.wav|And eventually these contrived shortages affect the farmer and what they call his mule feed, the residue from milling which farmers feed their cows and chickens.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_077.wav|And this means in another month or so we're told, fewer chickens, an unnecessary egg shortage and a beer shortage, something America hasn't seen since prohibition.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_078.wav|So whenever you're inclined to grumble at your lot, at the controls you live under, think as the Prophet says on these things.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_079.wav|And consider how hectic it can be to be a housewife in this country where the government is not buying the food in the first place, where controls start mainly with the bewildered retailer.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_080.wav|I hope the next letter will be more cheerful than this one.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_081.wav|But I thought you'd like to know how it feels to have left austere, shivery, old England and got back to the land of the free and the home of the brave.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_082.wav|Well, that was the first of, I'm allowed to see 2,458 letters.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_083.wav|Down the years I've heard often enough not to be coy about it, that some of my personal pleasure has passed over to listeners and very many of them have written to say so, from it seems every land on earth.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_084.wav|I thank them here and can only say I've been wishing for 49 years, I could reply to more than a fraction of them, among the far flung audience that radio makes miraculously possible.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_085.wav|Just recently a British journalist who seemed to have a gift for making mischief where he couldn't find it.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_086.wav|Ask me if anybody in the BBC had ever asked me to retire and was I going to do so anyway?
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_087.wav|I said the answer was no and no.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_088.wav|I've noticed if you retire you'll keel over.
wavs/cooke_1996-03-22_089.wav|The day of retirement from this assignment, which was given to me 50 years ago by the BBC official who bore the grand title of director of the spoken word, the day of retirement is up to the Lord of Us all, the great time keeper in the sky, the true director of the spoken word.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_001.wav|for the third year in succession, New York is full again of sun-tanned young beauties from the west coast, girls who have given up struggling up the Hollywood ladder, and have come to New York or come back to New York, whether a jobs galore for them in television.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_002.wav|They have a little corner in a single column with the stations opening for business around five in the afternoon and going off at 10.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_003.wav|Now, they start at nine in the morning with a program called Morning Chapel and the news and then end at midnight with the news.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_004.wav|These new habits sneak up on you so slightly and quickly that it's rather hard to realize what morons we were a couple of years ago.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_005.wav|In those primitive days, a housewife had to make her own mind up after breakfast, wear to shop and what to buy, but now, after Morning Chapel comes the television shopper.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_006.wav|There was a time too when housewives busy sweeping and washing dishes and vacuuming used to have to amuse the baby on the side, but presto, 10 am, the baby sitter show meant to rivet the baby's wayward attention while mother gets on with the chores.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_007.wav|The conscientious housewife, once she's through the daily dusting and cleaning, used to look over a couple of mixing bowls, an egg beater, and whatever meat was in the ice box, and think about the old man's supper.

wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_026.wav|But here's good news for you people on the lake shore.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_027.wav|He sweeps his brush right across the western half of the nation and lets it stop short of Lake Michigan.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_028.wav|Seems he says, with a foxy smile, there's a high pressure belt, just an itsy-bitsy high pressure belt stuck somewhere north of Milwaukee down to Indiana.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_029.wav|It's gonna hold off that blizzard, may even divert it north for a day or two.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_030.wav|So you folks here in town or up in Wisconsin, you don't have to worry about a thing till I see you again.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_031.wav|It's snug inside that high pressure belt.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_032.wav|Isotherms and equinoxes are just a couple of baby bears to this man and I swear that he teaches more people, adults as well as children, more about how weather is made than all the textbooks they never looked at.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_033.wav|He saves the mean punchline.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_034.wav|Just before he goes off, he remembers something.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_035.wav|Oh yes, he says, the temperatures.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_036.wav|Well, let's see now, through the Midwest it'll be around 20 degrees tonight.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_037.wav|That's 12 degrees of frost.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_038.wav|A form of expression never used by the way in the United States.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_039.wav|A number means above zero, thus 30 or 12.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_040.wav|10 below means below zero.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_041.wav|Then he rattles off a few significant figures.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_042.wav|Chicago, 12 tonight, up around 30 in the day tomorrow.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_043.wav|Little higher way across New England.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_044.wav|In the northern great plains, it'll be between 20 and 25 below zero.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_045.wav|Great Falls, Montana, somewhere down around 45 below.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_046.wav|Miami, he says, 85 by day, around 70 at night.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_047.wav|Good night.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_048.wav|Television, as you may have noticed, is a great thing to kick around and have fun with.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_049.wav|But I think I'd better tell you that although for hours, it is possible to drown in mediocrity.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_050.wav|There are by now quite a lot of first rate programs.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_051.wav|Not so much plays and ballets, which are obvious stuff, but nonetheless fascinating, if done thoroughly with lots of rehearsal.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_052.wav|Something that American television doesn't go in for so far.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_053.wav|The really outstanding things in American television are group discussions of all sorts big and small, news programs and comedy shows.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_054.wav|The best comedy shows are not necessarily the ones done by comedians who were famous in radio or on the stage.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_055.wav|Though two or three of those big evening shows are incomparable.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_056.wav|For another animal, the television has thrown up is the young man, usually in his early 30s, who is glib in consequential in a groucho-mark sort of way, and very much at home with a microphone wandering around a big studio audience.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_057.wav|There are people, and sometimes the crew, the television crew, talking back at them, insulting them.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_058.wav|Now there's no point in my mentioning any names because they would mean nothing to you.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_059.wav|They meant nothing to us six months ago.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_060.wav|There are about a half dozen of them, Spray, Easygoing, Irreverent, who just have a natural sense of irony and rely on it to fill a nightly hour or half hour with a studio audience.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_061.wav|One of them the other night had no set routine, couldn't think what to do with his audience, and just ordered his dinner up.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_062.wav|It came in with real non-actor waiters, and he sat and ate it for half an hour and thought aloud and kidded the waiters in one of the funniest things I've ever seen.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_063.wav|I told this by this time the television is murder on anybody who must rely on a writer, on a script, and just as the talking picture doomed to sudden death the beautiful profiles with rasping voices, so television has already registered a high mortality among actors and actresses and comedians who must learn lines.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_064.wav|The race is to the quick-witted, and there's already a fine crop of such.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_065.wav|The news programs I think are just about the best achievement of television so far.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_066.wav|The news commentators are beginning to throw away their news tape and talking about the news, some of them swiftly, easily, and accurately without script.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_067.wav|In 15 minutes one network opens with its news announcer, he gives you the main headlines, and then they switch to Washington for a movie of Congress that morning, and then to a studio in Washington for a couple of minutes with a couple of senators thrashing over the topic of the day.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_068.wav|Then back to New York for spoken news, read against still pictures, maps, and diagrams of Korea, then a three-minute shot of Korean newsreels flown in that day, and then out to Chicago for movies taken last night of a blizzard, a mind disaster, the British ambassador making a speech or whatever, and then back to New York for the late flashes and so on end.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_069.wav|There has been quite a bit of comment here in the last week or two on Mr. TS Eliot's comment that Britain should be aware of television as a grave threat to, least not his words, but I think his sense, as a grave threat to leisure, to intelligence, and culture in general.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_070.wav|The great question, what will it do to our children, rocked around the nation last year?
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_071.wav|A lot of us sympathize with Mr. Eliot, but honestly see the facts going against us.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_072.wav|For instance, mediocrity practically doesn't exist to a child.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_073.wav|Mediocrity is in the eye and the judgment of the beholder, and I would hesitate to say what is good or bad for a 10-year-old.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_074.wav|I know what's educational, but I don't think that's necessarily the same thing as what is good or bad.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_075.wav|However, to the dismay of us conscientious, culture conscious, and perhaps slightly hyper-condriarchal parents, Northwestern University has just published the results of its survey on what television does to the child, and its answer is nothing.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_076.wav|Nothing that hadn't already been there or been done before.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_077.wav|Television, it seems, is a reflector of what's in the child, not a poisonous snake infecting him from outside.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_078.wav|They found, for instance, that the amount of time spent on television by anyone or any hundred children has no sort of correlation with their marks in school.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_079.wav|Perhaps it does, after all, go in through one eye and out through the other, causing no pain, and I must confess a lot of pleasure.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_080.wav|The rising generation, then, is going to the dogs just as fast or as slow as you are knighted.
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_081.wav|Remember, it's a hard world for us moralists, isn't it?
wavs/cooke_1951-11-01_082.wav|Good night.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_001.wav|good evening.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_002.wav|Last week we saw for the first time a film made in Japan exactly 25 years ago about what happened on that fine hot day in August to the town of Hiroshima.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_003.wav|It was enough to lacerators and start up again the controversy which I suppose will never settle about President Truman's decision to drop the bomb.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_004.wav|I don't want to get into that either as an argument except to say that I noticed how few of the humane men who now thought or had thought all along that it was a moral mistake.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_005.wav|How few of them, if any, had responsibility for the waging of the war against Japan once the Germans were licked.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_006.wav|Without offering my own opinion or raising more dust over the bleached bones of Hiroshima there is one reminder I want to contribute that the handful of men who had to make the decision President Truman probably, and certainly General Marshall and Henry L. Stimson, were men just as humane and tortured as you and I.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_007.wav|But that in the end it came down to a gruesome choice which I for one would not have wanted to have to make for all the offers of redemption from all the religions in the world.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_008.wav|What the President and his advisors did not know what we rather confidently know now is that the Japanese in August 1945 were at the end of their rope.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_009.wav|The plans were going forward with awful misgivings on the part of Marshall and his staff for a step-by-step invasion of the Japanese islands.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_010.wav|The best estimate was that it would take 5 million American men and could not succeed till the end of 1946.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_011.wav|The probable casualties of Americans, Japanese and Japanese civilians went from about one and a half million to three millions.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_012.wav|Was there an alternative?
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_013.wav|The atomic scientists in New Mexico reported we can propose no technical demonstration likely to bring an end to the war.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_014.wav|We see no acceptable alternative to direct military use.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_015.wav|And with this bleak answer in its hands, the small band of presidential advisors led by old Secretary of War Stimson and General Marshall began again to assess the power of the Japanese to resist an invasion.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_016.wav|They studied the problem for a month and at the end of it they reluctantly decided that the alternative was between killing say 200,000 Japanese now or two million Japanese and a million Americans later on.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_017.wav|I suppose we must all have wondered in a distraught way at some time or other how it all started.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_018.wav|To be painstakingly scientific about it you could of course take it back far beyond Einstein and Rutherford and the quantum theory.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_019.wav|If you really got going you could find yourself back in the 5th century BC with empedacles who worked on the assumption that an atom is the smallest indivisible particle of matter.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_020.wav|But let us leap say 23 centuries forward to the slowly dawning idea that a bomb could be made and what first occurred to a scattered band of Jewish refugees in 1939 that the bomb might get into the wrong hands.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_021.wav|It was perhaps Hitler's most decisive as well as his most obscene error to persecute and drive out the Jews.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_022.wav|Well, it began on a drenching hut day in mid-Summer 1939 with two men, two refugees getting up in the morning and getting out a map and deciding to drive to the end of Long Island.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_023.wav|In more ways than one this is a letter from Long Island.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_024.wav|I've meant to tell you at various anniversary times about this never publicized little excursion.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_025.wav|I know about it by the sheer accident of living in the place they were driving to.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_026.wav|A point of land, a two mile peninsula that drops like an arrowhead from the north fork of the two forks that divide Long Island and enclose a large bay known as Piconic Bay.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_027.wav|Later on I wrote the two men who took the trip and checked on the facts.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_028.wav|Well, at the end of July 1939 these two refugees, both Hungarians, who had been run out of their labs in Germany, heard through the underground of their old friends who had fled to various countries of Europe, two things.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_029.wav|One was that there had been a secret meeting of German physicists in Berlin.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_030.wav|And the Germany had quite suddenly and secretly forbidden all exports of a certain kind of ore from the occupied country of Czechoslovakia.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_031.wav|These two refugees wondered if the American state department had any notion what the coincidence of these two items could signify.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_032.wav|They were both highly intelligent men, obviously passionately anti-Nazi, and they set up nights in their modest digs in New York and wondered how to make their information known.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_033.wav|If they had gone in person to the state department or the White House, they would quite likely have been waived away or locked up as nuts.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_034.wav|Let us call them Mr. W and Mr. S.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_035.wav|Mr.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_036.wav|S suddenly remembered the old man, another refugee, but better known he might carry a little weight.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_037.wav|That was it, get to the old man, tell him what was meant by the equation one secret meeting plus one export man.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_038.wav|But where was the old man?
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_039.wav|Well, one of them had heard that he was down at the end of Long Island, summering in a cottage rented from a local doctor.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_040.wav|Dr. Wait a minute, more, that was it, but now the place.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_041.wav|Mr.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_042.wav|W who remembered all this couldn't recall the name of the nearest village.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_043.wav|Now Long Island is 120 miles long and full of place names.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_044.wav|And the English names might be forgettable enough to a couple of Hungarians, but how about the Indian names, Acrobat, Noyac and Matituk and Rung Conkama and Apacquog and the like.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_045.wav|It was spelled, said Mr. W with a P.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_046.wav|They saw a name, 90 miles down the island on the map in red letters, Pachock.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_047.wav|That's it, that's the one.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_048.wav|So they drove off.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_049.wav|And they got out and they asked in stores and petrol stations, anybody know the whereabouts of Dr. Morris Cottage?
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_050.wav|Nobody'd ever heard of him.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_051.wav|They got into the car again and sweated over the map.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_052.wav|Could it be, said Mr. S, looking up to the bay to the north of them?
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_053.wav|Pecanic.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_054.wav|That's it, cried the other now I remember.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_055.wav|So they drove north and east along the north fork and came to the minute town of Pecanic, which to this day is one small saloon, one shop and a battered railroad station.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_056.wav|Dr. Moore, please.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_057.wav|Dr. Moore was unheard of.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_058.wav|It was one of those hideous days of a grey, leaden sky and the heat up in the 90s.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_059.wav|And the map was like a towel in their hands.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_060.wav|They were irritable and in despair and they turned to drive the hundred miles back to the city.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_061.wav|But less than two miles from Pecanic on the old two-lane highway you have to go through another one street town called Kachag.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_062.wav|They stopped at the drugstore to get some trifle they don't remember now, what?
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_063.wav|And one last try, they mentioned again the name of Dr. Moore.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_064.wav|Nothing.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_065.wav|Well, how about simply asking where the old man lived?
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_066.wav|They saw a boy about seven years of age standing on a corner with a fishing rod in his hand.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_067.wav|The old man was a great fisherman.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_068.wav|Sure said the little boy, he lives in Dr. Moore's cottage and he climbed in and he led them there.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_069.wav|The old man came out in his slippers and they told him their news and they had a hot hour explaining to him what it all meant or could mean.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_070.wav|They thought at first it would be better to write to the Belgian government who had the only other source of this particular ore and then send a copy to the State Department.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_071.wav|So they drove back to New York and there they had more misgivings.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_072.wav|The letter might vanish in the yawning files of the State Department.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_073.wav|They began to tremble at the awful possibilities of a long delay.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_074.wav|Maybe they should get the old man to write even to the president of the United States.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_075.wav|Now these young Hungarians were tense types but they were scientists.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_076.wav|They were not by any means used to this peri-mason sort of caper.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_077.wav|They made discrete inquiries of other friends, other obscure refugees and a German newer banker who was a personal friend of Rosefelt.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_078.wav|Maybe he could be the courier.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_079.wav|So they sat down and they drafted a bold and simple letter.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_080.wav|The great thing would be to get the old man to sign it.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_081.wav|And so on the 2nd of August they drove off again.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_082.wav|Not the same couple.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_083.wav|Mr. W had to go to California and Mr. S couldn't drive.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_084.wav|So he invited another Budapest refugee, Mr. T.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_085.wav|They drove the 100 miles with no fears this time of losing their way.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_086.wav|Not Pachog with a P, not Piconic with a P but Kachog with an Og and easy mistake to make our visiting friends do it all the time.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_087.wav|The old man was in his slippers again and they went inside into his small living room and they read a German draft and an English one.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_088.wav|And at last the old man nodded.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_089.wav|And he put his pen to it.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_090.wav|Next step onto the banker on the White House.
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_091.wav|It read,
wavs/cooke_1970-08-08_092.wav|Nassau Point, Piconic Long Island, August 2nd 1939,
