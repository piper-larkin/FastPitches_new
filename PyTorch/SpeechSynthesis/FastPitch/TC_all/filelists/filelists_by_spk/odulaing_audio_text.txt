wavs/odulaing_1966-07-15_009.wav|Religious observances then as now were scrupulously attended by the country people, and there was one, as indeed there is one today, which is dear to the countryman's heart, which is attendance at funerals, but then it was an occasion of a seemingly more colorful nature than of today.
wavs/odulaing_1966-07-15_010.wav|But all religious affairs were not garbed in solemn black, and the country within imagination could not be bounded or constricted by a prayer book or a mission or a stricture.
wavs/odulaing_1966-07-15_011.wav|What did other residents think of late 19th century Brory, Michael Soppel?

wavs/odulaing_1992_019.wav|And now that you're retired, what, what are you?
wavs/odulaing_1992_020.wav|In 1992, you know, is it?
wavs/odulaing_1992_021.wav|How do you pass the time?
wavs/odulaing_1992_022.wav|And you're on CDs now, I think.
wavs/odulaing_1992_023.wav|They have been able to, whatever they do, technically with things.
wavs/odulaing_1992_024.wav|Did you ever come across people like John McCormack?
wavs/odulaing_1992_025.wav|When, when you sang in Dublin, who would have accompanied you on those occasions?
wavs/odulaing_1992_026.wav|Did you like Ireland?
wavs/odulaing_1992_027.wav|You obviously had to keep yourself very fit.
wavs/odulaing_1992_028.wav|Were you feeling very nostalgic that night in Yarmut?
wavs/odulaing_1992_029.wav|I suppose it was hard living early on, was it?
wavs/odulaing_1992_030.wav|And that of course success can change all that.
wavs/odulaing_1992_031.wav|And they obviously liked, how long did you last as the anonymous radio singer?
wavs/odulaing_1997-02-07_001.wav|and tonight we'll remember him.
wavs/odulaing_1997-02-07_002.wav|We'll remember the strolling vagabonds, the entertainer, the vaudevillian, music hall artist, opera star, always top of the bill, and my memories go back a long way, back to Charlevin and County Cock, when as young lad I sat near the wireless and heard this voice,
wavs/odulaing_1997-02-07_003.wav|and I had my image of the man in the hat and the coat and the stick and the songs and the open road, and then I had the great happiness of meeting him in 92, 1992, and tonight we look back on that, and this is our tribute, these are our memories, your memories too,
wavs/odulaing_1997-02-07_004.wav|of Kevin O'Connor.
wavs/odulaing_1997-02-07_005.wav|Kevin O'Connor was born in Nottinghamshire, his father was a Dublin man, he was what you call a journeyman painter, but the young Kevin was not a single across the start, in fact he went working very early.
wavs/odulaing_1997-02-07_006.wav|Kevin O'Connor with the original recording of Hear My Song via Letter, he was of course the strolling vagabond on the stage, but before that it came into the radio when the BBC's head of variety, Eric Mashfits in 1935, taught up a program called The vagabond Lover, and he was this great singer allegedly unknown, but of course as always someone blew the gaff.
wavs/odulaing_1997-02-07_007.wav|The voice of Kevin O'Connor,
wavs/odulaing_1997-02-07_008.wav|I suppose when I hear him tonight I think of all the times, like I said, the hell of memory on the BBC on the light program when it's a child that listened to his songs and pictured him there, and then to meet him was a supposed one of the greatest events of my own life.
wavs/odulaing_1997-02-07_009.wav|I wonder how many of you are listening this evening, how does Salk Kevin O'Connor perform in Ireland in those days when he was here, or what years was he here, we're not so sure.
wavs/odulaing_1997-02-07_010.wav|I know that when he mentioned Cork Elian, he talked of one pat, and the pat to the best of my knowledge, the pat with the red hair was Pat Navin, Pat Navin, with an orchestra with a double bass player, I remember I had never seen a double bass player then, and I'm not sure what happened past, or where he is, or where the orchestra.
wavs/odulaing_1997-02-07_011.wav|My abiding memories I say apart from the BBC light program, which was a great found for singers in those days, will be the hallway, the dark hallway in The O'Connor's apartment in London, with the old walking stick, and the jaunt he had laid by, laid by to take to the high road another day.
wavs/odulaing_1997-02-07_012.wav|I thank especially Mrs. O'Connor, without whom, indeed, we might have had these memories, because Kevin was not just a reticent, he was very reticent, extremely so, and kept referring me to an article about his life, saying it's all there, and then of course that on his 78 records, we only got around to some of those, maybe someday, someday soon, we get around to more of them.
wavs/odulaing_1997-02-07_013.wav|He really embodied for me radio, communicating, warm, inviting, and timeless.
wavs/odulaing_1997-02-07_014.wav|A voice, indeed, for time and eternity, a man of many names, my friend,
wavs/odulaing_1997-02-07_015.wav|I'm glad to say Kevin O'Connor.
