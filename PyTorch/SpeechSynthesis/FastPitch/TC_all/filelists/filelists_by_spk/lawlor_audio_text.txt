wavs/lawlor_1995-10-18_002.wav|After a high court action last year, travelers were moved off an illegal halting site, but the county council was ordered by the court to build an official site for travelers.
wavs/lawlor_1995-10-18_003.wav|So for the past nine months, hundreds of residents from the new housing estates near the proposed site have run a 24 hour picket on the wine town road.
wavs/lawlor_1995-10-18_004.wav|They don't want a halting site near their homes.
wavs/lawlor_1995-10-18_005.wav|One man told me why he was giving up his time to join the protest against the travelers moving in.

wavs/lawlor_1995-10-18_007.wav|He doesn't pull his punches when he talks about the attitudes of some of the protesters against the halting site for his people.
wavs/lawlor_1995-10-18_008.wav|Jim McCullough also argues that races at the heart of the problems between travelers and settled people in Ireland.
wavs/lawlor_1995-10-18_009.wav|But the wine town protesters feel their way of life is being threatened.
wavs/lawlor_1995-10-18_010.wav|They say they're not racist, but they have a right to live with neighbors who shared their values and their way of life.
wavs/lawlor_1995-10-18_011.wav|John Boyle is chairman of the Action Committee.
wavs/lawlor_1995-10-18_012.wav|The reality seems to be a growing divide between the settled community that feels it's had enough, and the traveling community that feels the time has come to speak up for its rights.
wavs/lawlor_1995-10-18_013.wav|Jimmy Power took a local hotel to court because they barred him simply for being a traveler.
wavs/lawlor_1995-10-18_014.wav|He won his case and he's proud of it.
wavs/lawlor_1995-10-18_015.wav|And unless some way is found to bridge the bitter divide between the two communities, Jim McCullough believes the problem will get worse.
wavs/lawlor_1985-10-10_001.wav|uh, per month.
wavs/lawlor_1985-10-10_002.wav|And how many years did you work?
wavs/lawlor_1985-10-10_003.wav|And it'll be January before you get another check.
wavs/lawlor_1985-10-10_004.wav|In all your work and life, did you think you'd end up when you, when you, you know, when you weren't working anymore when you were retired?
wavs/lawlor_1985-10-10_005.wav|Did you think you'd end up with that little money and that little money being text?
wavs/lawlor_1985-10-10_006.wav|Now, were you contributing to a pension fund when you were working?
wavs/lawlor_1985-10-10_007.wav|And did you think, you know, I mean, did you imagine that you'd be getting as little as seven pounds a month?
wavs/lawlor_1985-10-10_008.wav|Did you think it'd be a lot more?
wavs/lawlor_1985-10-10_009.wav|And is there anything else about pensions that annoys you as well?
wavs/lawlor_1985-10-10_010.wav|Or like yourself, the puts in 37 and a half with a pound a week.
wavs/lawlor_1985-10-10_011.wav|And what about a time like Christmas because that must be financially a worrying time?
wavs/lawlor_1985-10-10_012.wav|Do you find it hard to accept that now?
wavs/lawlor_1985-10-10_013.wav|I mean, after you know, work in all your lives and to be reduced to telling your Unis is nephews, look, I'm sorry, I can't manage Christmas.
wavs/lawlor_1985-10-10_014.wav|That, that must upset you.
wavs/lawlor_1985-10-10_015.wav|But do you think that the issue of pensions is one that both workers and their unions and indeed their employers should pay a lot more attention to?
