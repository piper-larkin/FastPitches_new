mels/magee_1988-06-09_018.pt|pitch/magee_1988-06-09_018.pt|And then when you got a check on what was going out of their stores, you then went to the main shops around the country.|13|53
mels/magee_1988-06-09_019.pt|pitch/magee_1988-06-09_019.pt|I mean 30 and 44 calls a week and got a common average around the thing and worked out the charts.|13|53
mels/magee_1988-06-09_020.pt|pitch/magee_1988-06-09_020.pt|And I said that the one, the the most accurate chart that has ever been.|13|53

mels/magee_1988-06-09_026.pt|pitch/magee_1988-06-09_026.pt|Or just a little later, little later than 1962, I did the first ever late night radio program on radio and when I was open every night until 12 o'clock, it used to close earlier than that, except for occasional things.|13|53
