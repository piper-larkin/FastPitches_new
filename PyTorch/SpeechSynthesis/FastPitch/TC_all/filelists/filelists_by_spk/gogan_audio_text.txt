wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_001.wav|get your boots on, the first single from you two's latest album No Line Under Your Eyes and I'm joined by Larry Mullen himself.
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_002.wav|This is your twelfth studio album?
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_003.wav|Is it?
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_004.wav|So I think it's something.
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_005.wav|Now your last one, how to dismantle an atomic bomb, sold over nine million copies and after such incredible success, how do you go about preparing for a new album?
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_006.wav|Have you, all the songs ready when you go into the studio?
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_007.wav|Well, maybe we have a listen to moment of surrender now because I think it is a really beautiful song.
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_008.wav|I'm here chatting with Larry Mullen from you two and you'd several different producers on this album, Mary.
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_009.wav|I think we listen to another track now.
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_010.wav|Have you any particular track you'd want to hear yourself?
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_011.wav|Well, you know the biggest rock band in the world and apart from talent, a lot of hard work comes into that as you've been telling us there.
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_012.wav|Have you any advice to give young bands starting out?
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_013.wav|Well, any band starting out has a lot to develop too.
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_014.wav|You were the first band to sell a million CDs.
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_015.wav|The first have five consecutive number one albums in America.
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_016.wav|You've sold over 120 million albums of 22 Grammys, six in one year, that is, goes on and on and on.
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_017.wav|And the only non-UK act to win a bridge for outstanding contribution to British music.
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_018.wav|So I'd say anyone starting out is going to have a hard job.
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_019.wav|Are you going to tour this year?
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_020.wav|How do you prepare for a tour?
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_021.wav|What about the stage show now?
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_022.wav|Lately, to be kind of stripped back of it, is that the way there'll be in future, do you think?
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_023.wav|Larry, it's only a new two number that you look forward to playing.
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_024.wav|Well, any time I tell any girls I'm going to meet you, they always ask you the same question.
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_025.wav|How do you keep fit and how do you keep so young looking?
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_026.wav|Did you always want to be a drummer?
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_027.wav|Did you always want to be in a band or did you have other ideas of what you'd like to do with your life?
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_028.wav|What kind of music did you listen to then and what kind of bands did you listen to when you were young?
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_029.wav|Do you think now that's room for another band to become another you two, room for another big band like yourselves?
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_030.wav|I was actually going to ask you, you're together over two years, do you still get on?
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_031.wav|And what do you see your position in the band?
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_032.wav|Well, we hope to get to know you better now if are you going to appear in Ireland, Dublin and this tour or when you date yet for it?
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_033.wav|Well, no matter where it is, we'll be there.
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_034.wav|Thanks very much, you did Larry for talking, I know you're very busy and you're very good to come in and talk, thanks a lot.
wavs/gogan_2009-03-08_035.wav|What's the track from the album would you like us to finish on then today?

wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_003.wav|Grace, which I did tell me where you're from, my part of our and you're from, first of all.
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_004.wav|Is that why you told me to call you Sean O'Shaunasey?
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_005.wav|I always thought your name was Grace O'Shaunasey.
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_006.wav|For Grace, um, how did you, uh, become, uh, a model first of all?
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_007.wav|I, I talk about the ideal woman part later on.
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_008.wav|I'd like to find out something about you first, how you got into the business originally.
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_009.wav|You, you train there to be a model would you?
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_010.wav|Does this take a long time?
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_011.wav|I mean, to train, the training course.
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_012.wav|If you wait, uh, tall and thin, is this right?
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_013.wav|There's no fat models at all either.
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_014.wav|Why is this then?
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_015.wav|I mean, do plump girls not, I mean, there are plenty of plump girls in the world surely, you know, and they must make clothes to fit them, you know.
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_016.wav|Well, this certainly look when a new Grace this morning anyway.
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_017.wav|I really, I really play record for you first of all, I'm come back again to you.

wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_022.wav|Well, how Grace, can you tell us how you became the ideal woman of Europe?
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_023.wav|How did it all start?
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_024.wav|Started here in Ireland, first of all, I suppose.
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_025.wav|Who organized this thing in Italy?
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_026.wav|And what happened then?
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_027.wav|There, I mean, what do they look for in you, for instance?
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_028.wav|You had, you had a special dish there.
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_029.wav|We, um, I read about it in the paper actually.
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_030.wav|Well, since you won this, this contest, Grace,
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_031.wav|I mean, uh, the world is at your feet more or less, isn't it?
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_032.wav|I mean, everybody is clamoring for you, I'd say.
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_033.wav|But we know, uh, have you got any offers from abroad or anything like that?
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_034.wav|Have you been away at all?
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_035.wav|Well, we'll talk a little bit about New York, maybe in a minute.
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_036.wav|We play another record, I think, now for you.
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_037.wav|What, what would you like this time, Grace?
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_038.wav|Well, no, Grace, you mentioned to us, eh, just there a few moments ago, that you were in New York last week.
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_039.wav|What was your reason I'm going to New York?
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_040.wav|And did you do any work over there, any modeling over there at all?
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_041.wav|Well, I'm afraid Grace, it's time for us to leave this beautiful place, because our time is running out.
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_042.wav|It's been a very, very great pleasure talking to you this morning.
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_043.wav|Thank you very much for coming along.
wavs/gogan_1965-01-01_044.wav|Great pleasure Grace.
wavs/gogan_1999-12-21_001.wav|well, I, I, I, one of the, uh, poems in the book is something I know, a pint of plain is only man from flano brine.
wavs/gogan_1999-12-21_002.wav|I'm sure you would, yeah.
wavs/gogan_1999-12-21_003.wav|I do, I do. I do.
wavs/gogan_1999-12-21_004.wav|When things go wrong and will not come right, so you do the best you can.
wavs/gogan_1999-12-21_005.wav|When life looks black at the hour of night, a pint of plain is your only man.
wavs/gogan_1999-12-21_006.wav|When money's tight and it's hard to get and your horse has also ran,
wavs/gogan_1999-12-21_007.wav|when all you have is a heap of debt, a pint of plain is your only man.
wavs/gogan_1999-12-21_008.wav|When health is bad and your heart feels strange and your face is pale and warm,
wavs/gogan_1999-12-21_009.wav|when doctors say that you need a change, a pint of plain is your only man.
wavs/gogan_1999-12-21_010.wav|When food is scarce and your larder bear and oh rushers grease your palm,
wavs/gogan_1999-12-21_011.wav|when hunger grows as your meals are rare, a pint of plain is your only man.
wavs/gogan_1999-12-21_012.wav|In time trouble and lowzy strife, you've still got a darling plan.
wavs/gogan_1999-12-21_013.wav|You still can turn to a brighter life.
wavs/gogan_1999-12-21_014.wav|A pint of plain is your only man.
