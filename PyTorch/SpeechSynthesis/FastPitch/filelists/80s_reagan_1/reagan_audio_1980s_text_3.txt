wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_001.wav|Ladies and gentlemen, I'd plan to speak to you tonight to report on the state of the union for the events of earlier today have led me to change those plans.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_002.wav|Today is a day for morning and remembering.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_003.wav|Nancy and I are paying to the Corps, but the tragedy of the Shuttle Challenger.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_004.wav|We know we share this pain with all of the people of our country.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_005.wav|This is truly a national loss.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_006.wav|19 years ago, almost of the day, we lost three astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground, but we've never lost an astronaut in flight.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_007.wav|We've never had a tragedy like this.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_008.wav|And perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the Shuttle, but they, the Challenger 7 were aware of the dangers, but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_009.wav|We mourn seven heroes, Michael Smith, Dixkobe, Judith Resnick, Ronald McNair, Alison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis and Christomick O'Lough.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_010.wav|We mourn their loss as a nation together.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_011.wav|The families of the seven, we cannot bear as you do the full impact of this tragedy, but we feel the loss and we're thinking about you so very much.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_012.wav|Your loved ones were daring and brave, and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says, give me a challenge and I'll meet it with joy.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_013.wav|They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_014.wav|They wished to serve and they did.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_015.wav|They served all of us.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_016.wav|We've grown used to wonders in this century.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_017.wav|It's hard to dazzle us, but for 25 years the United States space program has been doing just that.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_018.wav|We've grown used to the idea of space and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_019.wav|We're still pioneers.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_020.wav|They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_021.wav|And I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching the live coverage of the Shuttle's takeoff.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_022.wav|I know it's hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_023.wav|It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_024.wav|It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_025.wav|The future doesn't belong to the faint hearted and belongs to the brave.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_026.wav|The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future and we'll continue to follow them.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_027.wav|I've always had great faith in and respect for our space program.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_028.wav|And what happened today does nothing to diminish it.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_029.wav|We don't hide our space program.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_030.wav|We don't keep secrets and cover things up.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_031.wav|We do it all up front and didn't public.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_032.wav|That's the way freedom is and we wouldn't change it for a minute.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_033.wav|We'll continue our quest in space.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_034.wav|There would be more Shuttle flights and more Shuttle crews and yes more volunteers, more civilians, more teachers in space.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_035.wav|Nothing ends here.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_036.wav|Our hopes and our journeys continue.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_037.wav|I want to add that I wish I could talk to every man and woman who works for NASA or who worked on this mission and tell them your dedication and professionalism have moved and impressed us for decades and we know of your anguish.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_038.wav|We share it.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_039.wav|There's a coincidence today on this day 390 years ago the great explorer Sir Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_040.wav|In his lifetime the great frontiers were the oceans and historian later said he lived by the sea, died on it and was buried in it.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_041.wav|Well today we can say of the challenger crew their dedication was like drakes complete.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_042.wav|The crew of the space shuttle challenger honored us for the manner in which they lived their lives.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_043.wav|We will never forget them nor the last time we saw them this morning as they prepared for their journey and waived goodbye and slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of God.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_044.wav|Thank you.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_001.wav|well thank you very much for that warm welcome.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_002.wav|Governor Ballye's Congressman Slotter and my very special thanks to to Senator Warner and President O'Neill for suggesting this invitation.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_003.wav|And you know, as president I have certain privileges, so I checked with President O'Neill and I'm delighted to announce that starting Monday night, one of my staff mentioned that Thomas Jefferson's favorite recreation was horseback riding.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_004.wav|Didn't sit back and rest but founded the University of Virginia without appreciating the symmetry not just of the architecture but of the mind that created it.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_005.wav|The man to whom that mind belongs is known to you as Mr. Jefferson.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_006.wav|And I think the familiarity of that term is justified.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_007.wav|His influence here is everywhere.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_008.wav|And yet while those of you at UVA fortunate to have before you physical reminders of the power of your founders intellect and imagination, it should be remembered that all you do here, indeed all of higher education in America, bears science too of his transforming genius.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_009.wav|The pursuit of science, the study of the great works, the value of free inquiry, in short the very idea of living the life of the mind.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_010.wav|Yes, these formative and abiding principles of higher education in America had their first and firmest advocate and their greatest embodiment in a tall, fair-headed, friendly man who watched this university take form from the mountainside where he lived.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_011.wav|The university was founding, he called a crowning achievement to a long and well-spent life.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_012.wav|Well, you're not alone in feeling his presence.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_013.wav|Presidents know about this too.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_014.wav|You've heard many times that during the first year of his presidency, John F. Kennedy said to a group of Nobel laureates in the state dining room of the White House that there had not been such a collection of talent in that place.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_015.wav|And the eyes of the 19-foot statue that gays directly into the White House, a reminder to any of us who might occupy that mansion of the quality of mind and generosity of heart that once abided there and so rarely seen there again.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_016.wav|But it's not just students and presidents.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_017.wav|It is every American, indeed every human life ever touched with a daring idea of self-government that Mr. Jefferson has influenced.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_018.wav|Yes, Mr. Jefferson was obliged to admit all previous attempts at popular government, had proven themselves failures.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_019.wav|But he believed that here on this continent, as one of his commentators put it, here was virgin soil and abundance of land, no degrading poverty, a brave and intelligent people which had just vindicated its title to independence after a long struggle with the mightiest of European powers.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_020.wav|Well, here was another chance, an opportunity for enlightened government, government based on the principles of reason and tolerance, government that left to the people the fruits of their labor and the pursuit of their own definition of happiness in the form of commerce or education or religion.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_021.wav|And so it's no wonder he asked that his epitaph read simply, here was, was born Thomas Jefferson author of the Declaration of Independence of the Statute of Virginia for religious freedom and father of the University of Virginia.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_022.wav|Well, as that epitaph shows, for all his learning and bookishness, Mr. Jefferson was a practical man, a man who made things, things like a university, a state government, a national government.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_023.wav|In founding and sustaining these institutions, he wanted them to be based on the same symmetry, the same balance of mind and faith in human creativity, evidence in the law.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_024.wav|He had known personal tragedy, he knew how disorderly a place the world could be.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_025.wav|Indeed, as a leader of a rebellion, he was himself an architect, if you will, of disorder.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_026.wav|But he also believed that man had received from God a precious gift of enlightenment, the gift of reason, a gift that could extract from the chaos of life, meaning truth, order.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_027.wav|Just as we see in his architecture, the balancing of circular with linear, of rotunda with pillar, we see in his works of government the same disposition toward balance, toward symmetry and harmony.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_028.wav|He knew successful self-government meant bringing together disparate interests and concerns, balancing, for example, on the one hand, the legitimate duties of government, the maintenance of domestic order and protection from foreign menace, with government's tendency to preempt its citizens' rights, take the fruits of their labors and reduce them ultimately to servitude.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_029.wav|So he knew that governing meant balance, harmony, and he knew from personal experience that danger posed to such harmony by the voices of unreason, special privilege, partisanship, or intolerance.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_030.wav|And I do mean personal experience.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_031.wav|You see, despite all of George Washington's warnings about the divisiveness of the partisan spirit, federalists and Republicans were constantly at each other in those days.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_032.wav|The federalists of the Northeast had held power for a long time, and were not anxious to relinquish it.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_033.wav|Years later, a New York congressman honored the good old days when, as he put it, here I quote, mean a mean-spirited low-life fellow raised wholly on hotcake made, of course, ground-southern corn, bacon, and harmony, was the 1800 equivalent of what I believe is known here as U.S. VA as a Gus Burger, precisely because there are such clear parallels to our own.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_034.wav|We too have seen a new populism in America, not at all unlike that of Jefferson's time.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_035.wav|We've seen the growth of a Jefferson-like populism that rejects the burden placed on the people by excessive regulation and taxation, that rejects the notion that judgeship should be used to further privately held beliefs, not yet approved by the people.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_036.wav|And finally, rejects to the notion that foreign policy must reflect only the rarefied concerns of Washington, rather than the common sense of a people who can frequently see far more plainly dangers to their freedom and to our national well-being.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_037.wav|It is this latter point that brings me to the University of Virginia today.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_038.wav|There has been much change in the last eight years in our foreign relations.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_039.wav|And this September, when I spoke to the United Nations, I summarized much of the progress we've seen in such matters as the human rights agenda, arms reduction, and resolving those regional conflicts that might lead to later a wider war.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_040.wav|I will not recite all of this here again today, but I do want you to know I found in the delegates afterward a warmth that I had not seen before.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_041.wav|Let me assure you not due to any eloquence on my part, but just a simple perception on their part that there is a chance for an opening, a new course in human events.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_042.wav|I think I detected a sense of excitement, even perhaps like that felt by those who lived in Jefferson's time, a sense of new possibilities for the idea of popular government.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_043.wav|Only this time is not just a single nation at issue.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_044.wav|It is the whole world where popular government might flourish and prosper.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_045.wav|Only a few years ago, this would have seemed the most outlandish and dreamiest of prospects, but consider for just a moment the striving for democracy that we have seen in places like the Philippines, Burma, Korea, Chile, Poland, South Africa, even places like China and the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_046.wav|One of the great unnoticed and yet most startling developments of this decade is this.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_047.wav|More of the world's populace is today living in relative freedom than ever before in history.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_048.wav|More and more nations are turning to freely elected democratic governments.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_049.wav|The statistics themselves are compelling.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_050.wav|According to one organization, Freedom House, in the past 15 years, the number of countries called not free, declined from 71 to 50, and the countries classified as free or partly free, increased from 92 to 117.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_051.wav|When you consider that according to the Freedom House count, 70% of those not living in freedom are in China and the Soviet Union, and even in those nations, as I say, we see glimpses of hope.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_052.wav|The picture is even brighter.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_053.wav|The most dramatic movement of all has taken place more than 90% of the people are now living in countries that are democratic or headed in that direction.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_054.wav|This democratic revolution has been accompanied by a change in economic thinking, comparable to the Newtonian revolution in physics.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_055.wav|That is no accident.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_056.wav|Free market economies have worked miracles in several nations of East Asia.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_057.wav|A UN General Assembly Special Session on Africa has called for more market-oriented structural reform in that region.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_058.wav|In Europe, the tide is against state ownership of property, and even in China and the Soviet Union, the theoretical underpinnings of socialist economics are being re-examined.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_059.wav|In this atmosphere, we've continued to emphasize prudent but deepening development of economic ties, which are critical to our economic health and the conduct of our foreign policy.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_060.wav|In our own hemisphere, we are about to implement a historic free trade agreement between the United States and Canada that could well serve as a model for the world.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_061.wav|These democratic and free market revolutions are really the same revolution.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_062.wav|They are based on the vital nexus between economic and political freedom, and on the Jeffersonian idea that freedom is indivisible.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_063.wav|That government's attempts to encroach on that freedom, whether it be through political restrictions on the rights of assembly, speech, or publication, or economic repression through high taxation and excessive bureaucracy, have been the principal institutional barrier to human progress.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_064.wav|But if this remarkable revolution has not been obvious to many, certainly one other eye-opening change has been self-evident.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_065.wav|Consider for just a moment the sights we've seen this year.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_066.wav|An American president with a Soviet counterpart strolling through Red Square and talking to pass-or-by about war and peace.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_067.wav|An American president there in the Lennon Hills of Moscow, speaking to the students of Moscow State University, young people like yourselves, about the wonder and splendor of human freedom.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_068.wav|An American president only last week with a future American president and the president of the Soviet Union standing in New York Harbor looking up at Lady Liberty, hearing again the prayer and the lips of all those millions who once passed that way in hope of a better life and future, a prayer of peace and freedom for all humanity.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_069.wav|And yes, even this week, in the devastation of Armenia, Americans and Russians making common cause as we once made common cause against another terrible enemy 44 years ago.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_070.wav|But it's not the visuals and the sound bites that matter.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_071.wav|Behind all of this is a record of diplomatic movement and accomplishment.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_072.wav|One of those visuals you've seen in the last year is the signing of accords between Mr. Gorbachev and me and the destruction of American and Soviet missiles.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_073.wav|It was more than just good television, more than just action news.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_074.wav|The INF Treaty is the first accord in history to eliminate an entire class of US and Soviet nuclear missiles.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_075.wav|And the Star Treaty, which deals with far larger arsenals of long range or what the experts call strategic weapons, calls for 50 percent reductions in such weapons.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_076.wav|In Geneva, where the portions of the draft treaty disputed by one side or the other are put in brackets, we are slowly seeing those brackets disappear so the treaty is coming closer.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_077.wav|And so too there's progress on nuclear testing agreements and chemical weapons.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_078.wav|And we're about to begin new negotiations on the conventional balance in Europe.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_079.wav|Mr. Gorbachev's recent announcement at the UN about troop reductions was most welcome and appreciated, but it's important to remember this is a part of and the result of a larger disarmament process set in motion several years ago.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_080.wav|Another area where the achievements are visible is that of regional conflicts.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_081.wav|In Afghanistan, we've seen a settlement leading towards Soviet withdrawal.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_082.wav|In Cambodia, the first steps have been taken toward withdrawal of Vietnamese troops.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_083.wav|In Brazaville, just this Tuesday, an American mediated accord was signed that will send some 50,000 Cuban soldiers home from Angola, the second reversal of Cuban military imperialism after our rescue of Grenada in 1983.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_084.wav|In the matter of human rights, we've also seen extraordinary progress.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_085.wav|The release of some political prisoners in the Soviet Union initial steps toward a reduction of state economic controls and more politically representative forms of government.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_086.wav|Some greater scope to publish and speak critically and increase in emigration and visible steps toward greater religious freedom.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_087.wav|And finally in our bilateral exchanges, we're seeing more Soviet and American citizens visiting each other's land and a greater interchange of scientific cultural and intellectual traditions.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_088.wav|The summits themselves are indications of the progress we've made here.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_089.wav|I look to the day when meetings between the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States will be regular and frequent and maybe not quite so newsworthy.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_090.wav|Where we're strong, steadfast, we succeed.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_091.wav|In the Persian Gulf, the United States made clear its commitment to defend freedom of navigation and free world interest.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_092.wav|And this helped hasten an end to the Gulf War.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_093.wav|And the country stood firm for years insisting that the PLO had to accept Israel's right to exist, sign under resolutions 242 and 338 and renounce terrorism.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_094.wav|And now that resolve has paid off.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_095.wav|Now the democratic revolution that I talked about earlier and all the change in movement and breakthroughs that I've just cited on the diplomatic front can be directly attributed to the restoration of confidence on the part of the democratic nations.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_096.wav|There can be little doubt that in the decade of the 80s, the cause of freedom and human rights has prospered and the specter of nuclear war has been pushed back because the democracies have recovered their strength, their compass.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_097.wav|Here at home a national consensus on the importance of strong American leadership is emerging.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_098.wav|As I said before, the Congress at the start of this year, no legacy would make me more proud than leaving in place such a consensus for the cause of world freedom, a consensus that prevents a paralysis of American power from ever occurring again.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_099.wav|Now I think much of the reason for all of this has to do with the new coherence and clarity that we brought to our foreign policy.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_100.wav|A new coherence based on a strong reaffirmation of values by the Allied nations, the same idea that so energized Mr. Jefferson and the other founders of this nation.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_101.wav|The idea of popular government has driven the revival of the West and a renewal of its values and its beliefs in itself.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_102.wav|But now the question, how do we keep the world moving toward the idea of popular government?
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_103.wav|Well today I offer three thoughts, reflections and warnings at the same time on how the Soviet-American relationship can continue to improve and how the cause of peace and freedom can be served.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_104.wav|First, the Soviet-American relationship, once marked by sterility and confrontation.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_105.wav|This relationship is now characterized by dialogue, realistic candid dialogue, serious diplomatic progress, and the sights and sounds of symmetry.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_106.wav|All of this is heady, inspiring, and yet my first reflection for you today is, all of it is still in doubt.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_107.wav|And the only way to make it last and grow and become permanent is to remember we're not there yet.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_108.wav|Serious problems, fundamental differences remain.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_109.wav|Our system is one of checks and balances.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_110.wav|There's for all its reforms remains a one-party authoritarian system that institutionalizes the concentration of power.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_111.wav|Our foreign relations embrace this expanding world of democracy that I've described.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_112.wav|There's can be known by the company they keep.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_113.wav|Cuba, Nicaragua, Ethiopia, Libya, Vietnam, North Korea.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_114.wav|Yes, we welcome Mr. Gorbachev's recent announcement of a troop reduction, but let us remember that the Soviet preponderance in military power in Europe remains, and a symmetry that offends our Jeffersonian senses and endangers our future.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_115.wav|So we must keep our heads, and that means keeping our skepticism.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_116.wav|We must realize that what has brought us here has not been easy, not for ourselves, nor for all of those who have sacrificed and contributed to the cause of freedom in the post-war era.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_117.wav|So this means in our treaty negotiations, as I've said, trust but verify.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_118.wav|I'm not a linguist, but I learned to say that much Russian and have used it in frequent meetings with Mr. Gorbachev.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_119.wav|Dover-Yai, no prover-Yai.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_120.wav|It means keeping our military strong.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_121.wav|It remains remembering no treaty is better than a bad treaty.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_122.wav|It means remembering the accords of Moscow and Washington summits followed many years of standing firm on our principles and our interests and those of our allies.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_123.wav|And finally, we need to recall that in the years of Daytona, we tend to forget the greatest weapon the democracies have in their struggle is public candor, the truth.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_124.wav|We must never do that again.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_125.wav|It's not an act of belligerence to speak to the fundamental differences between totalitarianism and democracy.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_126.wav|It's a moral imperative.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_127.wav|It doesn't slow down the pace of negotiations.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_128.wav|It moves them forward.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_129.wav|Throughout history, we see evidence that adversaries negotiate seriously with democratic nations only when they knew the democracy's harbor no illusions about those adversaries.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_130.wav|A second reflection I have on all this concerns some recent speculation that what is happening in the Soviet Union was in its way inevitable.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_131.wav|But since the death of Stalin, the Soviet state would have to evolve into a more moderate and status quo power in accordance with some vague theory of convergence.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_132.wav|I think this is wrong.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_133.wav|It's also dangerous because what we see in the Soviet Union today is a change of a different order than in the past.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_134.wav|For example, whatever the cruise chief era may or may not have represented in Soviet internal politics, we know how aspirations for greater freedom were crushed in Poland and Germany and even more bloodily in Hungary.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_135.wav|We also saw the construction of the Berlin Wall.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_136.wav|We saw Cuba become an active client state, a client state spreading subversion throughout Latin America and bringing the entire world to the brink of war with the missiles of October.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_137.wav|And let me assure you, Mr. cruise chief gave no speeches at the UN like that recently given by Mr. Gorbachev.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_138.wav|As one British UN official said about cruise chief appearances there, we were never quite sure whether it was indeed Mr. cruise chief shoe being used to pound the Soviet desk or whether Mr. Gromiko shoe had been borrowed.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_139.wav|We know to what happened in the Brezhnev era greater and greater expansionism, Afghanistan, economic decay and overwhelming corruption.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_140.wav|A greater and greater burden on the peoples of the Soviet Union, on all the peoples of the world.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_141.wav|Now this is changing.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_142.wav|How much and how fast it will change we do not know.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_143.wav|I would like to think that actions by this country, particularly our willingness to make ourselves clear, our expressions of firmness and will evidenced by our plain talk, strong defenses, vibrant alliances and readiness to use American power when American power was needed, helped to prompt the reappraisal that Soviet leaders have undertaken of their previous policies.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_144.wav|Even more, Western resolve demonstrated that the hard line advocated by some within the Soviet Union would be fruitless, just as our economic successes have set a shining example.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_145.wav|As I suggested in 1982, if the West maintained its strength, we would see economic needs clash with the political order in the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_146.wav|This has happened, but it could not have happened if the West had not maintained, indeed strengthened its will, its commitment to world freedom.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_147.wav|So there was nothing inevitable about all of this.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_148.wav|Human actions made the difference.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_149.wav|Mr. Gorbachev has taken some daring steps.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_150.wav|As I said before, this is the first Soviet leader, not to make world revolution a priority.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_151.wav|Well, let us credit those steps, let us credit him.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_152.wav|What happens in the next few years, whether all this progress is continued or ended, this is in large part up to us.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_153.wav|It's why now more than ever we must not falter.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_154.wav|American power must be exercised morally, of course, but it must also be exercised and exercised effectively.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_155.wav|For the cause of peace and freedom in the 80s, that power made all the difference.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_156.wav|The 90s will prove no different, and this brings us to my third point.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_157.wav|The relationship between the executive and the Congress.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_158.wav|It's precisely where Congress and the President have worked together, as in Afghanistan and Cambodia, or resolved differences as in Angola, the Persian Gulf, and many aspects of US-Soviet relations.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_159.wav|Precisely there, our policies have succeeded and we see progress.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_160.wav|But where Congress and the President have engaged each other as adversaries, as over Central America, US policies have faltered, and our common purposes have not been achieved.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_161.wav|Congress on again, off again, indecisiveness on resisting sand and east atirany and aggression, has left Central America a region of continuing danger.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_162.wav|Sometimes, congressional actions in foreign affairs have had the effect of institutionalizing that kind of adversarial relationship.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_163.wav|We see it in the war powers resolution.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_164.wav|In the attempted restrictions on the President's power to implement treaties and untrade policy.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_165.wav|We see it in the attempt to manage complex issues of foreign policy by the blunt instrument of legislation, such as unduly restrictive intelligent oversight, limits on arms transfers, and earmarking of 95 percent of our foreign assistance, denying a President the ability to respond flexibly to rapidly changing conditions.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_166.wav|Even in arms reduction, a President's ability to succeed depends on congressional support for military modernization.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_167.wav|Sometimes attempts are made to weaken my hand.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_168.wav|The founding fathers understood the need for effectiveness, coherence, consistency, and flexibility in the conduct of foreign affairs.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_169.wav|As Jefferson himself said, the transaction of business with foreign nations is executive altogether.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_170.wav|It belongs then to the head of that department, except as to such portions of it as are specially submitted to the Senate.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_171.wav|Exceptions are to be construed strictly.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_172.wav|For the President and the Vice President are elected by all the people.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_173.wav|So too is the Congress as a collegial body.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_174.wav|All who are elected to serve in these coordinate departments of our national government have one unmistakable and undeniable mandate to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_175.wav|To this, this foremost, they must always be attended.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_176.wav|For a President, it means protecting his office and its place in our constitutional framework.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_177.wav|In doing that, the President is accountable, accountable to the people in the most direct way, accountable to history, and to his own conscience.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_178.wav|The President and Congress, to be sure, share many responsibilities, but their roles are not the same.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_179.wav|Congress alone, for example, has the power of purse.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_180.wav|The President is chief executive, chief diplomat, and commander-in-chief.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_181.wav|How these great branches of government perform their legitimate roles is critically important to the nation's ability to succeed.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_182.wav|Nowhere more so than in the field of foreign affairs.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_183.wav|They need each other and must work together in common cause with all deference but within their separate spheres.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_184.wav|Today, we live in a world in which America no longer enjoys preponderant power, but must lead by example and persuasion, a world of pressing new challenges to our economic prosperity, a world of new opportunities for peace and of new dangers.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_185.wav|In such a world, more than ever, America needs strong and consistent leadership and the strength and resilience of the presidency are vital.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_186.wav|I think if we can keep these concerns in mind during the coming years, public debate and support will be enhanced and America's foreign policy will continue to prosper.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_187.wav|All of us know the terribly importance of maintaining the progress we've made in the decade of the 80s.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_188.wav|We're moving away from war and confrontation toward peace and freedom, and today toward a future beyond the imaginings of the past.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_189.wav|These are the stakes.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_190.wav|Some may find such prospects daunting.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_191.wav|I think you should find them challenging and exciting, and I think you can see that in all of this and you and your country will have a special role to play.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_192.wav|The issue before the world is still the same as the one that Jefferson faced so squarely and so memorably.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_193.wav|Can human beings manage their own affairs?
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_194.wav|Your self-determination and popular representative government possible.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_195.wav|Mr. Jefferson's work in life amounted to a great mighty asset to that question, so too will yours and America's if we can keep in mind the greatest and last lefson of Jefferson's life, and it has something to do with what I just spoke to about the executive in Congress.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_196.wav|I'm fond of recollecting that in the generation who had worked so hard and well together for the nation's independence, both came to regret that they had let partisan differences come between them.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_197.wav|For years, their estrangement lasted, but then when both retired, Jefferson at 68, De Monticello, and Adams at 76 to Quincy, they began through their letters to speak again to each other.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_198.wav|Letters that discussed almost every conceivable subject, gardening, horseback riding, even sneezing as a cure for hiccups.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_199.wav|But other subjects as well, the loss of loved ones, the mystery of grief and sorrow, the importance of religion, and of course the last thoughts, the final hopes of two old men, two great patriarchs, for the country that they had helped to found and loved so deeply.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_200.wav|It carries me back.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_201.wav|Jefferson wrote about his correspondence with his co-signer of the Declaration of Independence.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_202.wav|To the times when beset with difficulties and dangers, we were fellow laborers in the same cause, struggling for what is most valuable to man, his right to self-government, laboring always at the same or with some wave ever ahead, threatening to overwhelm us, and yet passing harmless, we rode through the storm with heart and hand.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_203.wav|It was their last gift to us, this lesson intolerance for each other, in charity, this insight into America's strength as a nation.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_204.wav|And when both died on the same day, within hours of each other, the date was July 4th, 50 years exactly after that first gift to us, the Declaration of Independence.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_205.wav|A great future is ours, and the worlds, if we but remember the power of those words.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_206.wav|Mr. Jefferson penned not just for Americans, but for all humanity, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_207.wav|Thank you, God bless you.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_001.wav|my lord chancellor, mr. speaker, the journey of which this visit forms a part is a long one, already it has taken me to two great cities of the west, Rome and Paris and of the economic summit at Versailles and there once again our sister democracies have proved that even in a time of severe economic strain free peoples can work together freely and voluntarily to address problems as serious as inflation, unemployment, trade and economic development in a spirit of cooperation and solidarity.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_002.wav|Other milestones lie ahead.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_003.wav|Later this week in Germany, we and our NATO allies will discuss measures for our joint defense and America's latest initiatives for a more peaceful, secure world through arms reductions.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_004.wav|Each stop of this trip is important, but among them all, this moment occupies a special place in my heart and in the hearts of my countrymen, a moment of kinship and homecoming in these hallowed halls.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_005.wav|Speaking for all Americans, I want to say how very much at home we feel in your house.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_006.wav|Every American would because this is, as we have been so eloquently told, one of democracy shrines.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_007.wav|Here the rights of free people and the processes of representation have been debated and refined.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_008.wav|It has been said that an institution is the lengthening shadow of a man.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_009.wav|This institution is the lengthening shadow of all the men and women who have sat here and all those who have voted to send representatives here.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_010.wav|This is my second visit to Great Britain as President of the United States.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_011.wav|My first opportunity to stand on British soil occurred almost a year and a half ago when your Prime Minister graciously hosted a diplomatic dinner at the British Embassy in Washington.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_012.wav|Mrs. Thatcher said then that she hoped I was not distressed to find staring down at me from the grand staircase a portrait of his royal majesty, King George III.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_013.wav|She suggested it was best to let bygones be bygones and in view of our two countries remarkable friendship in succeeding years she added that most Englishmen today would agree with Thomas Jefferson that quote a little rebellion now and then is a very good thing.

wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_015.wav|Well from here I will go on to bond and then Berlin where there stands a grim symbol of power untamed, the Berlin Wall, that dreadful gray gash across the city is in its third decade.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_016.wav|It is the fitting signature of the regime that built it and a few hundred kilometers behind the Berlin Wall there is another symbol.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_017.wav|In the center of Warsaw there is a sign that notes the distances to two capitals.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_018.wav|In one direction it points toward Moscow.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_019.wav|In the other it points toward Brussels, headquarters of Western Europe's tangible unity.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_020.wav|The marker says that the distances from Warsaw to Moscow and Warsaw to Brussels are equal.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_021.wav|The sign makes this point Poland is not east or west, Poland is at the center of European civilization.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_022.wav|It is contributed mightily to that civilization.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_023.wav|It is doing so today by being magnificently unreconsiled to oppression.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_024.wav|Poland's struggle to be Poland and to secure the basic rights we often take for granted demonstrates why we dare not take those rights for granted.

wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_029.wav|Optimism comes less easily today, not because democracy is less vigorous, but because democracy's enemies have refined their instruments of repression.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_030.wav|Yet optimism is in order because day by day democracy is proving itself to be a not at all fragile flower.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_031.wav|From added by totalitarianism, it had more than 30 years to establish their legitimacy.

wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_038.wav|Well, not always patient.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_039.wav|I do recall that on one occasion Sir Winston Churchill said an exasperation about one of our most distinguished diplomats.

wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_041.wav|Woody, as Sir Winston was, he also had that special attribute of great statesman, the gift of vision.

wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_044.wav|We have not inherited an easy world.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_045.wav|If developments like the Industrial Revolution which began here in England and the gifts of science and technology have made life much easier for us, they have also made it more dangerous.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_046.wav|There are threats now to our freedom, indeed to our very existence, that other generations could never even have imagined.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_047.wav|There is first the threat of global war.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_048.wav|No president, no congress, no prime minister, no parliament can spend a day entirely free of this threat.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_049.wav|And I don't have to tell you that in today's world, the existence of nuclear weapons could mean if not the extinction of mankind then surely the end of civilization as we know it.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_050.wav|That's why negotiations on intermediate-range nuclear forces now underway in Europe and the start talks, strategic arms reduction talks, which will begin later this month are not just critical to America and our western policy, they are critical to mankind.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_051.wav|Our commitment to early success in these negotiations is firm and unshakable and our purpose is clear, reducing the risk of war by reducing the means of waging war on both sides.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_052.wav|At the same time there is a threat posed to human freedom by the enormous power of the modern state.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_053.wav|History teaches the dangers of government that overreaches.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_054.wav|Political control taking precedence over free economic growth, secret police, mindless bureaucracy, all combining to stifle individual excellence and personal freedom.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_055.wav|Now I'm aware that among us here and throughout Europe there is legitimate disagreement over the extent to which the public sector should play a role in a nation's economy in life.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_056.wav|But on one point all of us are united.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_057.wav|Our abhorrence of dictatorship in all its forms, but most particularly totalitarianism and the terrible inhumanities it has caused in our time.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_058.wav|The great purge, Auschwitz and Dachau, the Goulag and Cambodia.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_059.wav|Historians looking back at our time will note the consistent restraint and peaceful intentions of the west.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_060.wav|They will note that it was the democracies who refused to use the threat of their nuclear monopoly in the 40s and early 50s for territorial or imperial gain.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_061.wav|Had that nuclear monopoly been in the hands of the communist world, the map of Europe indeed the world would look very different today.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_062.wav|And certainly they will note it was not the democracies that invaded Afghanistan or suppressed police solidarity or used chemical and toxin warfare in Afghanistan and Southeast Asia.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_063.wav|If history teaches anything it teaches self delusion in the face of unpleasant facts is folly.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_064.wav|We see around us today the marks of our terrible dilemma, predictions of Doomsday anti-nuclear demonstrations and arms race in which the West must for its own protection be an unwilling participant.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_065.wav|At the same time we see totalitarian forces in the world who seeks aversion and conflict around the globe to further their barbarous assault on the human spirit.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_066.wav|What then is our course?
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_067.wav|Must civilization perish in a hail of fiery atoms?
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_068.wav|Must freedom wither and acquire a deadening accommodation with totalitarian evil?
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_069.wav|Sir Winston Churchill refused to accept the inevitability of war or even that it was imminent.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_070.wav|He said,
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_071.wav|I do not believe that Soviet Russia desires war. What they desire is the fruits of war and the indefinite expansion of their power and doctrines.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_072.wav|But what we have to consider here today while time remains is the permanent prevention of war and the establishment of conditions of freedom and democracy as rapidly as possible in all countries.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_073.wav|Well this is precisely our mission today to preserve freedom as well as peace.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_074.wav|It may not be easy to see but I believe we live now at a turning point.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_075.wav|In an ironic sense Karl Marx was right.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_076.wav|We are witnessing today a great revolutionary crisis.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_077.wav|A crisis where the demands of the economic order are conflicting directly with those of the political order.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_078.wav|But the crisis is happening not in the free non-Marxist West but in the home of Marxist Leninism, the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_079.wav|It is the Soviet Union that runs against the tide of history by denying human freedom and human dignity to its citizens.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_080.wav|It also is in deep economic difficulty.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_081.wav|The rate of growth in the national product has been steadily declining since the 50s and is less than half of what it was then.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_082.wav|The dimensions of this failure are astounding, a country which employs one-fifth of its population and agriculture is unable to feed its own people.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_083.wav|We're at not for the private sector, the tiny private sector tolerated in Soviet agriculture, the country might be on the brink of famine.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_084.wav|These private plots occupy a bear 3% of the arable land but account for nearly one quarter of Soviet farm output and nearly one third of meat products and vegetables.

wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_086.wav|The constant shrinkage of economic growth combined with the growth of military production is putting a heavy strain on the Soviet people.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_087.wav|What we see here is a political structure that no longer corresponds to its economic base, a society where productive forces are hampered by political ones.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_088.wav|The decay of the Soviet experiment should come as no surprise to us.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_089.wav|Wherever the comparisons have been made between free and closed societies, West Germany and East Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia, Malaysia and Vietnam, it is the democratic countries that are prosperous and responsive to the needs of their people.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_090.wav|And one of the simple but overwhelming facts of our time is this, of all the millions of refugees we've seen in the modern world, their flight is always away from, not toward the communist world.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_091.wav|Today on the NATO line, our military forces face East to prevent a possible invasion.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_092.wav|On the other side of the line, the Soviet forces also face East, to prevent their people from leaving.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_093.wav|The hard evidence of totalitarian rule is caused in mankind and uprising of the intellect and will.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_094.wav|Whether it is the growth of the new schools of economics in America or England or the appearance of the so-called new philosophers in France, there is one unifying thread running through the intellectual work of these groups, rejection of the arbitrary power of the state, the refusal to subordinate the rights of the individual to the superstate, the realization that collectivism stifles all the best human impulses.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_095.wav|Since the Exodus from Egypt, historians have written of those who sacrificed and struggled for freedom, the stand at Thermopoli, the revolt of Spartacus, the storming of the Bastille of the Warsaw uprising in World War II.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_096.wav|More recently, we've seen evidence of this same human impulse in one of the developing nations in Central America.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_097.wav|For months and months, the world news media covered the fighting in El Salvador.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_098.wav|Day after day, we were treated to stories and film slanted toward the brave freedom fighters battling oppressive government forces in behalf of the silent, suffering people of that tortured country.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_099.wav|And then one day, those silent, suffering people were offered a chance to vote, to choose the kind of government they wanted.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_100.wav|Suddenly, the freedom fighters in the hills were exposed for what they really are.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_101.wav|Cuban backed guerrillas who want power for themselves and their backers, not democracy for the people.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_102.wav|They threatened death to any who voted and destroyed hundreds of buses and trucks to keep the people from getting to the polling places.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_103.wav|But on election day, the people of El Salvador and unprecedented 1.4 million of them braved ambush and gunfire and trudged for miles to vote for freedom.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_104.wav|They stood for hours in the hot sun, waiting for their turn to vote.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_105.wav|Members of our Congress who went there as observers told me of a woman who was wounded by rifle fire on the way to the post who refused to leave the line to have her wound treated until after she had voted.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_106.wav|A grandmother who had been told with the guerrillas she would be killed when she returned from the polls.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_107.wav|And she told the guerrillas, you can kill me, you can kill my family, kill my neighbors, but you can't kill us all.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_108.wav|The real freedom fighters of El Salvador turned out to be the people of that country, the young, the old, the in between.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_109.wav|Strange, but my own country, there's been little if any news coverage of that war since the election.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_110.wav|Now, perhaps they'll say it's well because there aren't newer struggles now distant islands in the South Atlantic.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_111.wav|Young men are fighting for Britain.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_112.wav|And yes, voices have been raised protesting their sacrifice for lumps of rock and earth so far away, but those young men aren't fighting for mere real estate.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_113.wav|If there had been firmer support for that principle some 45 years ago, perhaps our generation wouldn't have suffered the bloodletting of World War II.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_114.wav|In the Middle East now the guns sound once more, this time in Lebanon, a country that for too long had to endure the tragedy of civil war, terrorism, and foreign intervention and occupation.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_115.wav|The fighting in Lebanon and the part of all parties must stop, and Israel should bring its forces home.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_116.wav|But this is not enough.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_117.wav|We must all work to stamp out the scourge of terrorism that in the Middle East makes war an ever-present threat.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_118.wav|But beyond the trouble spots lies a deeper, more positive pattern.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_119.wav|Around the world today, the Democratic revolution is gathering new strength.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_120.wav|In India, a critical test has been passed with the peaceful change of governing political parties.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_121.wav|In African Nigeria is moving into remarkable and unmistakable ways to build and strengthen its democratic institutions.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_122.wav|In the Caribbean and Central America, 16 of 24 countries have freely elected governments, and in the United Nations, eight of the ten developing nations which have joined that body in the past five years are democracies.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_123.wav|In the communist world as well, man's instinctive desire for freedom and self-determination surfaces again and again.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_124.wav|To be sure there are grim reminders of how brutally the police stamp state attempts to snuff out this quest for self-rule, 1953 in East Germany, 1956 in Hungary, 1968 in Shekhovs, LaVakia, 1981 in Poland.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_125.wav|But the struggle continues in Poland.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_126.wav|And we know that there are even those who strive and suffer for freedom within the confines of the Soviet Union itself.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_127.wav|How we conduct ourselves here in the Western democracies will determine whether this trend continues.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_128.wav|No democracy is not a fragile flower.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_129.wav|Still, it needs cultivating.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_130.wav|If the rest of this century is to witness the gradual growth of freedom and democratic ideals, we must take actions to assist the campaign for democracy.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_131.wav|Some argue that we should encourage democratic change in right-wing dictatorships, but not in communist regimes.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_132.wav|Well, to accept this preposterous notion as some well-meaning people have is to invite the argument that once countries achieve a nuclear capability, they should be allowed an undisturbed reign of terror over their own citizens.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_133.wav|We reject this course.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_134.wav|As for the Soviet view, Chairman Brezhnev repeatedly has stressed that the competition of ideas and systems must continue and that this is entirely consistent with relaxation of tensions and peace.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_135.wav|Well, we ask only that these systems begin by living up to their own constitutions, abiding by their own laws, and complying with the international obligations they have undertaken.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_136.wav|We ask only for a process, a direction, a basic code of decency, not for an instant transformation.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_137.wav|We cannot ignore the fact that even without our encouragement, there has been and will continue to be repeated explosions against repression and dictatorships.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_138.wav|The Soviet Union itself is not immune to this reality.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_139.wav|Any system is inherently unstable that has no peaceful means to legitimize its leaders.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_140.wav|In such cases, the very repressiveness of the state ultimately drives people to resist it, if necessary, by force.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_141.wav|While we must be cautious about forcing the pace of change, we must not hesitate to declare our ultimate objectives and to take concrete actions to move toward them.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_142.wav|We must be staunch in our conviction that freedom is not the sole prerogative of a lucky few, but the inalienable and universal right of all human beings.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_143.wav|So states the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which among other things guarantees free elections.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_144.wav|The objective I propose is quite simple to state.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_145.wav|To foster the infrastructure of democracy, the system of a free press, unions, political parties, universities, which allows the people to choose their own way to develop their own culture, to reconcile their own differences through peaceful means.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_146.wav|This is not cultural imperialism, it is providing the means for genuine self-determination and protection for diversity.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_147.wav|Democracy already flourishes in countries with very different cultures and historical experiences.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_148.wav|It would be cultural condescension or worse to say that any people preferred dictatorship to democracy.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_149.wav|Who would voluntarily choose not to have the right to vote?
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_150.wav|Decide to purchase government propaganda handouts instead of independent newspapers.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_151.wav|Prefer government to work or control unions.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_152.wav|Opt for land to be owned by the state instead of those who tell it.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_153.wav|Want government repression of religious liberty, a single political party instead of a free choice, a rigid cultural orthodoxy instead of democratic tolerance and diversity.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_154.wav|Since 1917, the Soviet Union has given covert political trading and assistance to Marxist Leninists in many countries.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_155.wav|Of course, it also has promoted the use of violence and subversion by these same forces.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_156.wav|Over the past several decades, West European and other social Democrats, Christian Democrats and leaders have offered open assistance to fraternal, political and social institutions to bring about peaceful and democratic progress, appropriately for a vigorous new democracy.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_157.wav|The Federal Republic of Germany's political foundations have become a major force in this effort.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_158.wav|We in America now intend to take additional steps as many of our allies have already done toward realizing this same goal.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_159.wav|The chairman and other leaders of the National Republic and and Democratic Party organizations are initiating a study with the bipartisan American Political Foundation to determine how the United States can best contribute as a nation to the global campaign for democracy now gathering force.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_160.wav|They will have the cooperation of congressional leaders of both parties, along with representatives of business, labor and other major institutions in our society.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_161.wav|I look forward to receiving their recommendations and working with these institutions and the Congress in the common task of strengthening democracy throughout the world.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_162.wav|It is time that we committed ourselves as a nation in both the public and private sectors to assisting democratic development.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_163.wav|We plan to consult with leaders of other nations as well.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_164.wav|There is a proposal before the Council of Europe to invite parliamentarians from democratic countries to a meeting next year in Strasbourg.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_165.wav|That prestigious gathering could consider ways to help democratic political movements.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_166.wav|This November in Washington, there will take place an international meeting on free elections.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_167.wav|In the next spring there will be a conference of world authorities on constitutionalism and self-government hosted by the Chief Justice of the United States.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_168.wav|Authorities from a number of developing and developed countries, judges, philosophers and politicians with practical experience have agreed to explore how to turn principle into practice and further the rule of law.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_169.wav|At the same time, we invite the Soviet Union to consider with us how the competition of ideas and values with which his committed support can be conducted on a peaceful and reciprocal basis.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_170.wav|For example, I am prepared to offer President Brezhnev an opportunity to speak to the American people on our television periodically appear on each other's television to discuss major events.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_171.wav|Now, I don't wish to sound overly optimistic, yet the Soviet Union is not immune from the reality of what is going on in the world.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_172.wav|It has happened in the past, a small ruling elite either mistakenly attempts to ease domestic unrest through greater repression and foreign adventure, or it chooses a wiser course.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_173.wav|It begins to allow its people a voice in their own destiny.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_174.wav|Even if this latter process is not realized soon, I believe the renewed strength of the democratic movement, complemented by a global campaign for freedom, will strengthen the prospects for arms control and a world at peace.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_175.wav|I have discussed on other occasions, including my address on May 9th, the elements of Western policies toward the Soviet Union, to safeguard our interests and protect the peace.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_176.wav|What I'm describing now is a plan and a hope for the long term, the March of Freedom and Democracy, which will leave Marxism, Leninism on the ash heap of history as it has left other tyrannies which stifle the freedom and muzzle the self-expression of the people.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_177.wav|And that's why we must continue our efforts to strengthen NATO, even as we move forward with our zero-option initiative and the negotiations on intermediates' range forces, and our proposal for a one-third reduction in strategic ballistic missile warheads.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_178.wav|Our military strength is a prerequisite to peace, but let it be clear, we maintain this strength in the hope it will never be used.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_179.wav|For the ultimate determined in the struggle is not going that's now going on in the world.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_180.wav|Will not be bombs and rockets, but a test of wills and ideas.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_181.wav|A trial the ideals to which we are dedicated.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_182.wav|The British people know that given strong leadership, time and a little bit of hope, the forces have good ultimately rally and triumph over evil.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_183.wav|Here among you is the cradle of self-government, the mother of parliament.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_184.wav|Here is the enduring greatness of the British contribution to mankind.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_185.wav|The great civilized ideas, individual liberty, representative government, and the rule of law under God.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_186.wav|I've often wondered about the shyness of some of us in the west about standing for these ideals that have done so much to ease the plight of man and the hardships of our imperfect world.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_187.wav|This reluctance to use those vast resources that our command reminds me of the elderly lady whose home was bombed in the blitz.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_188.wav|As the rescuers moved about, they found a bottle of brandy she'd stored behind the staircase, which was all that was left standing.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_189.wav|And since she was barely conscious, one of the workers pulled the cork to give her a taste of it.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_190.wav|She came around immediately and said here, and there, now put it back.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_191.wav|That's for emergencies.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_192.wav|Well, the emergency is upon us.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_193.wav|Let us be shy no longer.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_194.wav|Let us go to our strength.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_195.wav|Let us offer hope.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_196.wav|Let us tell the world that a new age is not only possible, but probable.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_197.wav|During the dark days of the Second World War when this island was incandescent with courage, Winston Churchill exclaimed about Britain's adversaries.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_198.wav|What kind of a people do they think we are?
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_199.wav|Well, Britain's adversaries found out what extraordinary people the British are.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_200.wav|But all the democracies paid a terrible price for allowing the dictators to underestimate us.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_201.wav|We dare not make that mistake again.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_202.wav|So let us ask ourselves, what kind of people do we think we are?
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_203.wav|And let us answer, free people, worthy of freedom, and determine not only to remain so, but to help others gain their freedom as well.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_204.wav|Sir Winston led his people to great victory and war, and then lost an election just as the fruits of victory were about to be enjoyed.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_205.wav|But he left office honorably and has it turned out temporarily, knowing that the liberty of his people was more important than the fate of any single leader.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_206.wav|History recalls his greatness in ways no dictator will ever know.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_207.wav|And he left us a message of hope for the future, as timely now as when he first uttered it as opposition leader in the commons nearly 27 years ago.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_208.wav|When he said, when we look back on all the perils through which we have passed, and at the mighty foes that we have laid low, and all the dark and deadly designs that we have frustrated, why should we fear for our future?
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_209.wav|We have, he said, come safely through the worst.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_210.wav|Well, the task I've set forth will long outlive our own generation.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_211.wav|But together, we too have come through the worst.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_212.wav|Let us now begin a major effort to secure the best, a crusade for freedom that will engage the faith and fortitude of the next generation.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_213.wav|For the sake of peace and justice, let us move toward a world in which all people are at last free to determine their own destiny.

wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_006.wav|The other day in the East Room of the White House that a meeting there someone asked me whether I was aware of all the people out there who were praying for the president and I had to say yes I am, I felt it, I believe in intercessionary prayer but I couldn't help but say to that questioner after he'd asked the question that, or at least say to a them that if sometimes when he was praying he got a busy signal, I have been driven many times to my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else to go.
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_007.wav|From the joy and the good feeling of this conference I go to a political reception.
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_008.wav|I don't know why but that bit of scheduling reminds me of a story which I'll share with you and Evangelical Minister and a politician arrived at Heaven's Gate one day together.
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_009.wav|St. Peter, after doing all the necessary formalities took them in hand to show them where their quarters would be and he took them to a small single room with a bed, a chair and a table and said this was for the clergyman and the politician was a little worried about what might be in store for him and he couldn't believe it then when St. Peter stopped in front of a beautiful mansion with lovely grounds, many servants and told him that these would be his quarters and he couldn't help but ask he said, but wait how there's something wrong, how do I get this mansion while that good and holy man only gets a single room?
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_010.wav|The St. Peter said you have to understand how things are up here, God fearing dedicated noble men and women in public life.
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_011.wav|Present company included and yes we need your help to keep us ever mindful of the ideas and the principles that brought us into the public arena in the first place.
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_012.wav|The basis of those ideals and principles is a commitment to freedom and personal liberty that itself is grounded in the much deeper realization that freedom prospers only where the blessings of God are avidately sought and humbly accepted.
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_013.wav|The American experiment in democracy rests on this insight.
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_014.wav|It's discovery was the great triumph of our founding fathers voiced by William Penn when he said if we will not be governed by God we must be governed by tyrants.

wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_018.wav|Now I don't have to tell you that this puts us in opposition to or at least out of step with a prevailing attitude of many who have turned to a modern-day secularism discarding the tried and time-tested values upon which our very civilization is based no matter how well intentioned their value system is radically different from that of most Americans and while they proclaim that they're freeing us from superstitions of the past they've taken upon themselves the job of superintending us by government rule and regulation sometimes their voices are louder than ours but they are not yet a majority superior he is evident in the controversy now going on in Washington since I've been involved

wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_020.wav|I've watched TV TV panel shows discuss this issue of seen columnists to pontificating on our error but no one seems to mention morality as playing a part in the subject of sex are we to believe that something so sacred can be looked upon as a purely physical thing with no potential for emotional and psychological harm and isn't it the parents right to give counsel and advise to keep their children from making mistakes that may affect their entire lives many of us in government would like to know what parents think about this intrusion in their family by government we're going to fight in the courts parental notifications really only one example of many attempts to water down traditional values and even abrogate the original terms of American democracy

wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_028.wav|last year i sent the congress a constitutional amendment to restore prayer to public schools already this session there's growing bipartisan support for the amendment and i am calling on the congress to act speedily to pass it and to let our children pray that it was unconstitutional for a school district to give equal treatment to religious and non-religious student groups even when the group meetings were being held during the students own time the first amendment never intended to require government to discriminate against religious speech on the whole question of prohibiting discrimination against religious forms of student speech such legislation could go far to restore freedom of religious speech for public school students and i hope the congress considers these bills quickly and with your help i think it's possible we could also get the constitution of the amendment through the congress this year literally wiped off the books of fifty states statutes protecting the rights of unborn children abortion on demand now takes the lives of up to one and a half million unborn children a year human life legislation ending this tragedy will someday pass the congress and you and i must never rest until it does that the unborn child is not a living entity then it's right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness must be protected
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_029.wav|you may remember that when abortion on demand began many indeed i'm sure many of you warned that the practice would lead to a decline in respect for human life that the philosophical premises used to justify abortion on demand would ultimately be used to justify other attacks on the sacredness of human life in fantaside or mercy killing tragically enough those warnings proved all too true only last year a court permitted the death by starvation of a handicapped infant
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_030.wav|i have directed the health and human services department to make clear to every health care facility in the united states that the rehabilitation act of nineteen seventy three protects all handicapped persons against discrimination based on handicaps that each and every recipient of federal funds who provides health care services to infants must post and keep posted in a conspicuous place a notice stating that discriminatory failure to feed and care for handicapped infants in this facility is prohibited by federal law it also lists a twenty four hour toll free number so that nurses and others may report violations in time to save the infant's life in addition recent legislation introduced by in the congress by representative henry high de villanoi not only increases restrictions on publicly financed abortions it also addresses this whole problem of infanticide

wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_046.wav|i pointed out that as good marxist leninists the soviet leaders have openly and publicly declared that the only morality they recognize is that which will further their cause which is world revolution
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_047.wav|i think i should point out
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_048.wav|i was only quoting lenin their guiding spirit who said in 1920 that they repudiate all morality that proceeds from supernatural ideas that's their name for religion or ideas that are outside class conceptions
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_049.wav|morality is entirely subordinate to the interests of class war and everything is moral that is necessary for the annihilation of the old exploiting social order and for uniting the proletariat
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_050.wav|well i think the refusal of many influential people to accept this elementary fact of soviet doctrine illustrates an historical reluctance to see totalitarian powers for what they are
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_051.wav|we saw this phenomenon in the 1930s we see it too often today this doesn't mean we should isolate ourselves and refuse to seek an understanding with them

wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_053.wav|I a number of years ago I heard a young father a very prominent young man in the entertainment world addressing a tremendous gathering in California it was during the time of the cold war and communism and our own way of life were very much in people's minds and he was speaking to that subject and suddenly though I heard him saying I love my little girls more than anything and I said to myself oh no don't you can't don't say that but I had underestimated him he went on I would rather see my little girls die now still believing in God there were thousands of young people in that audience they came to their feet with shouts of joy they had instantly recognized the profound truth in what he had said with regard to the physical and the soul and what was truly important yes let us pray for the salvation of all of those who live in that totalitarian darkness pray they will discover the joy of knowing God but until they do let us be aware that while they preach the supremacy of the state declare its omnipotence over individual man and predict its eventual domination of all peoples on the earth they are the focus of evil in the modern world it was C. S. Lewis who in his unforgettable screw tape letters wrote the greatest evil is not done now in those sort of dens of crime that Dickens loved to paint it is not even done in concentration camps and labor camps in those we see its final result but it is conceived and ordered moved seconded carried and minited in clear carpeted warmed and well-lighted offices by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth chave and cheeks who do not need to raise their voice well because these quiet men do not raise their voices because they sometimes speak in soothing tones of brotherhood and peace because like other dictators before them they're always making their final territorial demand some would have us accept them at their word and accommodate ourselves to their aggressive impulses but if history teaches anything it teaches that simple minded appeasement or wishful thinking about our adversaries is folly it means the betrayal of our past the squandering of our freedom so I urge you to speak out against those who would place the United States in a position of military and moral inferiority you know I've always believed that old screw tape reserved his best efforts for those of you in the church so in your discussions of the nuclear freeze proposals I urge you to be where the temptation of pride the temptation of blithely declaring yourselves above it all and label both sides equally at fault to ignore the facts of history and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire to simply call the arms race a giant misunderstanding and thereby remove yourself from the struggle between right and wrong and good and evil I ask you to resist the attempts of those who would have you withhold your support for our efforts this administration's efforts to keep America strong and free while we negotiate real and verifiable reductions in the world's nuclear ourselves and one day with God's help their total elimination while America's military strength is important let me add here that I've always maintained the struggle now going on for the world will never be decided by bombs or rockets by armies or military might the real crisis we face today is a spiritual one at root it is a test of moral will and faith.

wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_003.wav|We pause together to mourn and honor the valor of our seven challenger heroes and I hope that we're now ready to do what they would want us to do.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_004.wav|Go forward America and reach for the stars.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_005.wav|Seven, but we shall go forward.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_006.wav|Mr. Speaker, before I begin my prepared remarks, may I point out that tonight marks the 10th and last state of the union message that you've presided over.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_007.wav|And on behalf of the American people, I want to salute you for your service to Congress and countries.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_008.wav|I have come to review with you the progress of our nation to speak of unfinished work and to set our sights on the future.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_009.wav|I am pleased to report the state of our union is stronger than a year ago and growing stronger each day.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_010.wav|United in spirit, powerful in pride and patriotism.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_011.wav|America is on the move.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_012.wav|But it wasn't long ago that we looked out on a different land.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_013.wav|Locked factory gates, long gasoline lines, intolerable prices and interest rates turning the greatest country on Earth into a land of broken dreams.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_014.wav|Government growing beyond our consent had become a lumbering giant, slamming shut the gates of opportunity, threatening to crush the very roots of our freedom.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_015.wav|What brought America back?
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_016.wav|The American people brought us back.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_017.wav|The future will be ours for the future belongs to the free.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_018.wav|Tonight the American people deserve our thanks for 37 straight months of economic growth for sunrise firms and modernized industries creating 9 million new jobs in three years.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_019.wav|Interest rates cut in half, inflation falling over from 12 percent in 1980 to under four today, and a mighty river of good works, a record of $74 billion in voluntary giving just last year alone.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_020.wav|And despite the pressures of our modern world, family and community remain the moral core of our society.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_021.wav|Guardians of our values and hopes for the future.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_022.wav|Family and community are the co-stars of this great American comeback.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_023.wav|They are why we say tonight, private values must be at the heart of public policies.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_024.wav|What is true for families in America is true for America in the family of free nations.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_025.wav|History is no captive of some inevitable force.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_026.wav|History is made by men and women of vision and courage.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_027.wav|Tonight freedom is on the march.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_028.wav|The United States is the economic miracle, the model to which the world once again turns.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_029.wav|We stand for an idea whose time is now, only by lifting the weights from the shoulders of all, can people truly prosper and can peace among all nations be secure.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_030.wav|Teddy Roosevelt said that a nation that does great work lives forever.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_031.wav|We have done well, but we cannot stop at the foothills when Everest beckons.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_032.wav|It's time for America to be all that we can be.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_033.wav|We speak tonight of an agenda for the future, an agenda for a safer, more secure world.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_034.wav|And we speak about the necessity for actions to steal us for the challenges of growth, trade and security in the next decade and the year 2000.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_035.wav|And we will do it not by breaking faith with bedrock principles, but by breaking free from failed policies right here in Washington, DC.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_036.wav|This week I will send you our detailed proposals.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_037.wav|Tonight let us speak of our responsibility to redefine government's role.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_038.wav|Not to control, not to demand or command, not to contain us, but to help in times of need, and above all to create a ladder of opportunity to full employment so that all Americans can climb toward economic power and justice on their own.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_039.wav|But we cannot win the race to the future, shackle to a system that can't even pass a federal budget.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_040.wav|We cannot win that race held back by horse and buggy programs that waste tax dollars and squander human potential.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_041.wav|We cannot win that race if we're swamped in a sea of red ink.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_042.wav|Now Mr. Speaker, you know I know when the American people know the federal budget system is broken.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_043.wav|It doesn't work.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_044.wav|Before we leave this city, let you and I work together to fix it.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_045.wav|Passage of Graham Rudman
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_046.wav|Hollings gives us an historic opportunity to achieve what has eluded our national leadership for decades, forcing the federal government to live within its means.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_047.wav|Your schedule now requires that the budget resolution be passed by April 15th.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_048.wav|The very day America's families have to foot the bill for the budgets that you produce.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_049.wav|How often we read of a husband and wife, both working, struggling from paycheck to paycheck, to raise a family, meet them or each pay their taxes and bills.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_050.wav|And yet some in Congress say taxes must be raised.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_051.wav|Well, I'm sorry.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_052.wav|They're asking the wrong people to tighten their belts.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_053.wav|We do not face large deficits because American families are under taxed.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_054.wav|We face those deficits because the federal government overspends.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_055.wav|That he tailed budget that we will submit.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_056.wav|We'll meet the Graham Rudman Hollings target for deficit reductions.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_057.wav|Meet our commitment to ensure a strong national defense.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_058.wav|Meet our commitment to protect social security and the truly less fortunate.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_059.wav|And yes, meet our commitment to not raise taxes.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_060.wav|Well, not by taking from those in need.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_061.wav|As families take care of their own, government must provide shelter and nourishment for those who cannot provide for themselves.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_062.wav|But we must revise or replace programs enacted in the name of compassion that degrade the moral worth of work, encourage family breakups, and drive entire communities into a bleak and heartless dependency.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_063.wav|Graham Rudman Hollings can mark a dramatic improvement.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_064.wav|But experience shows that simply setting deficit targets does not assure they'll be met.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_065.wav|We must proceed with grace commission reforms against waste.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_066.wav|And tonight I ask you to give me what 43 governors already have.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_067.wav|Give me a line item veto this year.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_068.wav|I'll take the heat.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_069.wav|This authority would not give me any monopoly power, but simply prevent spending measures from sneaking through that could not pass on their own merit.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_070.wav|And you can sustain or override my veto.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_071.wav|That's the way the system should work.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_072.wav|Once we've made the hard choices, we should lock in our gains.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_073.wav|We must meet it.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_074.wav|Defense is not just another budget expense.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_075.wav|Keeping America strong, free, and at peace is solely the responsibility of the federal government.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_076.wav|It is government's prime responsibility.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_077.wav|We have devoted five years trying to narrow a dangerous gap, born of illusion and neglect.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_078.wav|And we've made important gains.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_079.wav|Yet the threat from Soviet forces, conventional and strategic, from the Soviet drive for domination, from the increase in espionage and state terror remains great.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_080.wav|This is reality.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_081.wav|Closing our eyes will not make reality disappear.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_082.wav|We pledged together to hold real growth and defense spending to the bare minimum.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_083.wav|My budget honors that pledge.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_084.wav|And I'm now asking you, the Congress, to keep its end to the bargain.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_085.wav|The Soviets must know that if America reduces her defenses, it will be because of a reduced threat, not a reduced resolve.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_086.wav|But as I've said before, the most powerful force we can enlist against the federal deficit is an ever-expanding American economy unfettered and free.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_087.wav|A magic of opportunity, unreserved unfailing, unrestrained.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_088.wav|Isn't this the calling that unites us?
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_089.wav|I believe our tax rate cuts for the people of Dunmore to spur a spirit of risk taking and help America's economy break free than any program since John Kennedy's tax cut almost a quarter century ago.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_090.wav|Now, history calls us to press on to complete efforts for an historic tax reform, providing new opportunity for all and ensuring that all pay their fair share.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_091.wav|But no more.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_092.wav|We've come this far.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_093.wav|We cannot and we will not accept tax reform that is a tax increase in disguise.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_094.wav|True reform must be an engine of productivity and growth, and that means a top personal rate.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_095.wav|No higher than 35 percent.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_096.wav|True reform must be truly fair, and that means raising personal exemptions to $2,000.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_097.wav|True reform means a tax system that at a long last is pro-family, pro-jobs, pro-future, and pro-America.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_098.wav|We have already taken actions to counter unfair trading practices to pry open closed foreign markets.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_099.wav|We will continue to do so.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_100.wav|We will also oppose legislation touted as providing protection that in reality pits one American worker against another, one industry against another, one community against another, and that raises prices for us all.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_101.wav|If the United States can trade with other nations on a level playing field, we can out-produce, out-compete, and outsell anybody anywhere in the world, at home and reliable exchange rates around the world.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_102.wav|We must never again permit wild currency swings to cripple our farmers and other exporters.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_103.wav|Farmers in particular have suffered from past unwise government policies.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_104.wav|They must not be abandoned with problems they did not create and cannot control.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_105.wav|We've begun coordinating economic and monetary policy among our major trading partners, but there's more to do.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_106.wav|And tonight, I am directing Treasury Secretary Jim Baker to determine if the nations of the world should convene to discuss the role and relationship of our currencies.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_107.wav|Americans are striding forward to embrace the future.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_108.wav|We see it not only in our recovery, but in three straight years of falling crime rates, as families and communities band together to fight pornography, drugs and lawlessness, and to give back to their children the safe and yes innocent childhood they deserve.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_109.wav|We see it in the Renaissance in education, the rising SAT scores for three years.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_110.wav|Last years increased the greatest since 1963.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_111.wav|It wasn't government in Washington lobbies that turned education around.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_112.wav|It was the American people who in reaching for excellence knew to reach back to basics.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_113.wav|We must continue the advance by supporting discipline in our schools, vouchers that give parents freedom of choice, and we must give back to our children their lost right to acknowledge God in their classrooms.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_114.wav|Yet today there is a wound in our national conscience.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_115.wav|America will never be whole as long as the right to life granted by our creator is denied to the unborn.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_116.wav|For the rest of my time I shall do what I can to see.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_117.wav|We must also look to the condition of America's families.

wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_119.wav|In the welfare culture, the breakdown of the family, the most basic support system, has reached crisis proportions.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_120.wav|In female and child poverty, child abandonment, horrible crimes, and deteriorating schools.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_121.wav|After hundreds of billions of dollars in poverty programs, the plight of the poor grows more painful.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_122.wav|But the waste in dollars and cents pales before the most tragic loss, the sinful waste of human spirit and potential.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_123.wav|We can ignore this terrible truth no longer.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_124.wav|As Franklin Roosevelt warned, 51 years ago standing before this chamber, he said, well fair, is an archotic, a subtle destroyer of the human spirit.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_125.wav|And we must now escape the spider's web of dependency.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_126.wav|Tonight I am charging the White House domestic council to present me by December 1, 1986, an evaluation of programs and a strategy for immediate action to meet the financial, educational, social, and safety concerns of poor families.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_127.wav|I am talking about real and lasting emancipation because the success of welfare should be judged by how many of its recipients become independent.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_128.wav|After seeing how devastating illness can destroy the financial security of a family, I am directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Oda's Bowen.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_129.wav|To report to me by year end with recommendations on how the private sector and government can work together to address the problems of affordable insurance for those whose life savings would otherwise be threatened when catastrophic illness strikes.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_130.wav|And tonight I want to speak directly to America's younger generation because you hold the destiny of our nation in your hands.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_131.wav|With all the temptations young people face, it sometimes seems the allure of the permissive society requires superhuman feats of self-control.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_132.wav|But the call of the future is too strong.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_133.wav|A challenge too great to get lost in the blind alleyways of dissolution, drugs, and despair.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_134.wav|Never has there been a more exciting time to be alive.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_135.wav|A time of browsing wonder in heroic achievement as they said in the film back to the future, where we're going, we don't need roads.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_136.wav|What today physicists, peering into the infinitely small realms of subatomic particles, find reaffirmations of religious faith.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_137.wav|Astronomers build a space telescope that conceded the edge of the universe and possibly back to the moment of creation.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_138.wav|So yes, this nation remains fully committed to America's space program.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_139.wav|We're going forward with our shuttle flights.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_140.wav|We're going forward to build our space station.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_141.wav|And we're going forward with research on a new orient express that could by the end of the next decade, take off from Dallas Airport, accelerate up to 25 times the speed of sound, attaining low earth orbit or flying to Tokyo within two hours.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_142.wav|And free mankind from the prison of nuclear terror.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_143.wav|Now America must meet another to make our strategic defense real for all the citizens of planet Earth.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_144.wav|Let us speak of our deepest longing for the future to leave our children a land that is free and just in a world at peace.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_145.wav|It's my hope that our firesides summit in Geneva, Mr. Gorbachev's lead to a more stable relationship.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_146.wav|Surely no people on Earth hate war or love peace more than we Americans.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_147.wav|Our differences with a system that openly proclaims and practices an alleged right to command people's lives and to export its ideology by force are deep and abiding.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_148.wav|Logic and history compel us to accept that our relationship be guided by realism, rock hard, clear-eyed, steady and sure.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_149.wav|Our negotiators in Geneva have proposed a radical cut and offensive forces by each side with no cheating.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_150.wav|They have made clear that Soviet compliance with the letter of the spirit of agreements is essential.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_151.wav|If the Soviet government wants an agreement that truly reduces nuclear arms, there will be such an agreement.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_152.wav|We know that peace follows in freedom's path and conflicts erupt when the will of the people is denied.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_153.wav|So we must prepare for peace not only by reducing weapons but by bolstering prosperity, liberty and democracy however and wherever we can.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_154.wav|Free your markets, sound currencies around the world.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_155.wav|We strengthen the family of freedom every time we work with allies and come to the aid of friends under siege and we can enlarge the family of free nations if we will defend the unalienable rights of all God's children to follow their dreams.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_156.wav|To those imprisoned in regime's health captive, to those beaten for daring to fight for freedom and democracy, for their right to worship, to speak, to live and to prosper, in the family of free nations.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_157.wav|We say to you tonight, you are not alone freedom fighters, America will support you with moral and material assistance.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_158.wav|You're right not just to fight and die for freedom, but to fight surely no issue is more important for peace in our own hemisphere, for the security of our frontiers, for the protection of our vital interests, than to achieve democracy and Nicaragua and to protect Nicaragua's democratic neighbors.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_159.wav|This year I will be asking Congress for the means to do what must be done for the great and good cause.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_160.wav|Ascook Jackson, the inspiration for our bipartisan commission on Central America once said, in matters of national security, the best politics is no politics.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_161.wav|Indeed for the remainder of the century.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_162.wav|After all, we've done so far, let no one say that this nation cannot reach the destiny of our dreams.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_163.wav|America believes America is ready.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_164.wav|America can win the race to the future and we shall.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_165.wav|The American dream is a song of hope that rings through night-winter air, vivid tender music that warms our hearts when the least among us aspire to the greatest things.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_166.wav|To venture a daring enterprise, to unearth new beauty and music literature and art, to discover a new universe inside a tiny silicon chip or a single human cell.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_167.wav|We see the dream coming true in the spirit of discovery of Richard Cavoli.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_168.wav|All his life he's been enthralled by the mysteries of medicine.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_169.wav|And Richard, we know that the experiment that you began in high school was launched and lost last week, yet your dream lives, and as long as it's real, work of noble know will yet be done, work that could reduce the harmful effects of x-rays on patients and enable astronomers to view the golden gateways to the farthest stars.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_170.wav|We see the dream glow in the towering talent of a 12-year-old to long-forward.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_171.wav|A child prodigy of gospel music, he has surmounted personal adversity to become an accomplished pianist and singer.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_172.wav|He also directs the choirs of three churches and is performed at the Kennedy Center.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_173.wav|With God as your composer to own your music will be the music of angels.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_174.wav|We see the dream being saved by the courage of a 13-year-old Shelby butler, honor student and member of her school's safety patrol.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_175.wav|Seeing another girl freeze in terror before and out of controlled school bus, she risked her life and pulled her to safety.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_176.wav|With braver like you or Shelby, America need never fear for our future.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_177.wav|And we see the dream born again in the joyful compassion of a 13-year-old Trevor Ferrell.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_178.wav|Two years ago, age 11, watching men and women bedding down in abandoned doorways on television you.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_179.wav|He was watching.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_180.wav|Trevor left his suburban Philadelphia home to bring blankets and food to the helpless and homeless.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_181.wav|And now, 250 people help him fulfill his nightly vigil.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_182.wav|Trevor's yours is the living spirit of brotherly love.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_183.wav|Would you for?
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_184.wav|Thank you.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_185.wav|You are heroes of our hearts.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_186.wav|We look at you and know it's true in this land of dreams fulfilled where greater dreams may be imagined.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_187.wav|Nothing is impossible.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_188.wav|No victory is beyond our reach.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_189.wav|No glory will ever be too great.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_190.wav|So now, it's up to us, all of us, to prepare America for that day when our work will pale before the greatness of America's champions in the 21st century.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_191.wav|The world's hopes rest with America's future.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_192.wav|America's hopes rest with us.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_193.wav|So let us go forward to create our world of tomorrow in faith, in unity, and in love.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_194.wav|God bless you and God bless America.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_001.wav|good evening.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_002.wav|At Christmas time, every home takes on a special beauty, a special warmth, and that's certainly true of the White House where so many famous Americans have spent their Christmas's over the years.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_003.wav|This final home, the people's house has seen so much, in so much a part of all our lives in history.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_004.wav|It's been humbling and inspiring for Nancy and me to be spending our first Christmas in this place.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_005.wav|We've lived here as your tenants for almost a year now, and what a year it's been.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_006.wav|As a people we've been through quite a lot, moments of joy, tragedy, and of real achievement, moments that I believe have brought us all closer together.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_007.wav|GK Chesterden once said that the world would never starve for wonders, but only for the want of wonder.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_008.wav|At this special time of year we all renew our sense of wonder in recalling the story of the first Christmas in Bethlehem nearly two thousand years ago.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_009.wav|Some celebrate Christmas as the birthday of a great and good philosopher and teacher.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_010.wav|Others of us believe in the divinity of the child born in Bethlehem, but he was and is the promised Prince of Peace.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_011.wav|Yes, we've questioned why he who could perform miracles chose to come among us as a helpless babe, but maybe that was his first miracle, his first great lesson that we should learn to care for one another.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_012.wav|Tonight in millions of American homes the glow of the Christmas tree is a reflection of the love Jesus taught us.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_013.wav|Like the shepherds and wise men of that first Christmas, we Americans have always tried to follow a higher light, a star if you will.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_014.wav|That alonely campfire vigils along the front here in the darkest days of the Great Depression to war and peace, the twin beacons of faith and freedom have brightened the American sky.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_015.wav|At times our footsteps may have floated, but trusting in God's help we've never lost our way.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_016.wav|Just across the way from the White House stand the two great emblems of the holiday season, a menorah symbolizing the Jewish Festival of Hanukkah and the National Christmas tree, a beautiful towering blue spruce from Pennsylvania.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_017.wav|Like the National Christmas tree, our country is a living, growing thing planted in rich American soil.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_018.wav|Only our devoted care can bring it to full flower.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_019.wav|So let this holiday season be for us a time of rededication.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_020.wav|Even as we rejoice, however, let us remember that for some Americans this will not be as happy a Christmas as it should be.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_021.wav|I know a little of what they feel.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_022.wav|I remember one Christmas Eve during the Great Depression.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_023.wav|My father, opening what he thought was a Christmas greeting.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_024.wav|It was a notice that he no longer had a job.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_025.wav|Over the past year we'd begun a long hard work of economic recovery.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_026.wav|Our goal is in America in which every citizen who needs and wants a job can get a job.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_027.wav|Our program for recovery has only been in place for 12 weeks now, but it is beginning to work.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_028.wav|With your help and prayers, it will succeed.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_029.wav|We're winning the battle against inflation, runaway government spending and taxation, and that victory will mean more economic growth, more jobs, and more opportunity for all Americans.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_030.wav|A few months before he took up residence in this house, one of my predecessors, John Kennedy, tried to sum up the temper of the times with a quote from an author closely tied to Christmas, Charles Dickens.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_031.wav|We were living, he said, in the best of times and the worst of times.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_032.wav|But in some ways that's even more true today.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_033.wav|The world is full of peril as well as promise.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_034.wav|Too many of its people, even now, live in the shadow of want and tyranny.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_035.wav|As I speak to you tonight, the fate of a proud and ancient nation hangs in the balance.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_036.wav|For a thousand years, Christmas has been celebrated in Poland, a land of deep religious faith.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_037.wav|But this Christmas brings little joy to the courageous Polish people.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_038.wav|They have been betrayed by their own government.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_039.wav|The men who rule them and their totalitarian allies fear the very freedom that the Polish people cherish.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_040.wav|They have answered the stirrings of liberty with brute force, killings, mass arrests, and the setting up of concentration camps.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_041.wav|Like Wollessa and other solidarity leaders are imprisoned, their fate unknown.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_042.wav|Factories, minds, universities, and homes have been assaulted.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_043.wav|The Polish government has trampled underfoot solemn commitments to the UN Charter and the Helsinki Accords.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_044.wav|It has even broken the Gdansk Agreement of August 1980, by which the Polish government recognized the basic right of its people to form free trade unions and to strike.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_045.wav|The tragic events now occurring in Poland almost two years to the day after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan have been precipitated by public and secret pressure from the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_046.wav|It is no coincidence that Soviet Marshall Kulikoff, Chief of the Warsaw Pact Forces, and other senior Red Army officers were in Poland while these outrages were being initiated.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_047.wav|And it is no coincidence that the martial law proclamations imposed in December by the Polish government were being printed in the Soviet Union in September.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_048.wav|The target of this depression is the solidarity movement, but in attacking solidarity is enemies attack an entire people.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_049.wav|Ten million of Poland's 36 million citizens are members of solidarity taken together with their families.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_050.wav|They account for the overwhelming majority of the Polish nation.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_051.wav|By persecuting solidarity, the Polish government wages war against its own people.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_052.wav|I urge the Polish government and its allies to consider the consequences of their actions.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_053.wav|How can they possibly justify using naked force to crush a people who ask for nothing more than the right to lead their own lives in freedom and dignity?
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_054.wav|Roof force may intimidate, but it cannot form the basis of an enduring society, and the alien Polish economy cannot be rebuilt with terror tactics.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_055.wav|Poland needs cooperation between its government and its people, not military oppression.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_056.wav|If the Polish government will honor the commitments it has made to basic human rights in documents like the Gdansk Agreement, we in America will gladly do our share to help the shattered Polish economy just as we help the countries of Europe after both world wars.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_057.wav|It's ironic that we offered, and Poland expressed interest in accepting our help, after World War II, the Soviet Union intervened then and refused to allow such help to Poland.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_058.wav|But at the forces of tyranny and Poland, and those who incite them from without do not relent, they should prepare themselves for serious consequences.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_059.wav|Already, throughout the free world, citizens have publicly demonstrated their support for the Polish people.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_060.wav|Our government and those of our allies have expressed moral revulsion at the police state tactics of Poland's oppressors.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_061.wav|The Church has also spoken out in spite of threats and intimidation, but our reaction cannot stop there.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_062.wav|I want emphatically to state tonight that if the outrageous in Poland do not cease, we cannot and will not conduct business as usual with the perpetrators and those who aid and abet them.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_063.wav|Make no mistake, their crime will cost them dearly in their future dealings with America and free peoples everywhere.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_064.wav|I do not make this statement lightly or without serious reflection.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_065.wav|We have been measured and deliberating in our reaction to the tragic events in Poland.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_066.wav|We have not acted in haste, and the steps I will outline tonight and others we may take in the days ahead are firm, just and reasonable.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_067.wav|In order to aid the suffering Polish people during this critical period, we will continue the shipment of food through private humanitarian channels, but only so long as we know that the Polish people themselves receive the food.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_068.wav|The neighboring country of Austria has opened her doors to refugees from Poland.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_069.wav|I have therefore directed that American assistance including supplies of basic food and stuff, they offered to aid the Austrians in providing for these refugees.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_070.wav|But to underscore our fundamental opposition to the repressive actions taken to the Polish government against its own people, the administration has suspended all government-sponsored shipments of agricultural and dairy products to the Polish government.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_071.wav|This suspension will remain in force until absolute assurances are received that distribution of these products is monitored and guaranteed by independent agencies.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_072.wav|We must be sure that every bit of food provided by America goes to the Polish people, not to their oppressors.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_073.wav|The United States is taking immediate action to suspend major elements of our economic relationships with the Polish government.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_074.wav|We have halted the renewal of the Export-Import Banks line of export credit insurance to the Polish government.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_075.wav|We will suspend Polish civil aviation privileges in the United States.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_076.wav|We are suspending the right of Poland's fishing fleet to operate in American waters.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_077.wav|And we are proposing to our allies the further restriction of high technology exports to Poland.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_078.wav|These actions are not directed against the Polish people.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_079.wav|They are a warning to the government of Poland that free men cannot and will not stand idly by in the face of brutal repression.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_080.wav|To underscore this point, I have written a letter to General Yarosłicki, head of the Polish government.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_081.wav|In it, I outline the steps we are taking and warned of the serious consequences if the Polish government continues to use violence against his populace.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_082.wav|I urged him to free those in arbitrary detention, to lift martial law and to restore the internationally recognized rights of the Polish people to free speech and association.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_083.wav|The Soviet Union, through its threats and pressures, deserves a major share of blame for the developments in Poland.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_084.wav|So I have also sent a letter to President Brezhnev urging him to permit the restoration of basic human rights in Poland, provided for in the Helsinki Final Act.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_085.wav|In it, I informed him that if this repression continues, the United States will have no choice but to take further concrete political and economic measures affecting our relationship.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_086.wav|When 19th century Polish patriots rose against foreign oppressors, their rallying cry was, for our freedom and yours, while that model still rings true in our time.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_087.wav|There is a spirit of solidarity abroad in the world tonight that no physical force can crush.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_088.wav|It crosses national boundaries and enters into the hearts of men and women everywhere.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_089.wav|In factories, farms and schools, in cities and towns around the globe, we, the people of the free world, stand as one with our Polish brothers and sisters.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_090.wav|Their cause is ours and our prayers and hopes go out to them this Christmas.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_091.wav|Yesterday, I met in this very room with Romual Spasowski, the distinguished former Polish ambassador who was sought asylum in our country in protest to the suppression of his native land.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_092.wav|He told me that one of the ways the Polish people have demonstrated their solidarity in the face of martial law is by placing lighted candles in their windows to show that the light of liberty still glows in their hearts.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_093.wav|Ambassador Spasowski requested that on Christmas Eve, a lighted candle will burn in the White House window as a small but certain beacon of our solidarity with the Polish people.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_094.wav|I urge all of you to do the same tomorrow night on Christmas Eve as a personal statement of your commitment to the steps we are taking to support the brave people of Poland in their time of troubles.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_095.wav|Once, earlier in this century, an evil influence threatened that the lights were going out all over the world.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_096.wav|Let the light of millions of candles in American homes give notice that the light of freedom is not going to be extinguished.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_097.wav|We are blessed with a freedom and abundance denied to so many.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_098.wav|Let those candles remind us that these blessings bring with them a solid obligation, an obligation to the God who guides us and obligation to the heritage of liberty and dignity handed down to us by our forefathers and an obligation to the children of the world whose future will be shaped by the way we live our lives today.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_099.wav|Christmas means so much because of one special child, but Christmas also reminds us that all children are special, that they are gifts from God, gifts beyond price that mean more than any presence money can buy.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_100.wav|In their love and laughter, in our hopes for their future lies the true meaning of Christmas.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_101.wav|So in a spirit of gratitude for what we've been able to achieve together over the past year and looking forward to all that we hope to achieve together in the years ahead, Nancy and I want to wish you all the best of holiday seasons.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_102.wav|As Charles Dickens, whom I quoted a few moments ago said so well in a Christmas carol, God bless us everyone.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_001.wav|this morning at 7 a.m., the union representing those who man America's air traffic control facilities called a strike.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_002.wav|This was the culmination of seven months of negotiations between the federal aviation administration and the union.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_003.wav|At one point in these negotiations, agreement was reached and signed by both sides, granting a $40 million increase in salaries and benefits.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_004.wav|This is twice what other government employees can expect.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_005.wav|It was granted in recognition of the difficulties inherent in the work these people perform.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_006.wav|Now however, the union demands are 17 times what had been agreed to $681 million.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_007.wav|This would impose a tax burden on their federal citizens which is unacceptable.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_008.wav|I would like to thank the supervisors and controllers who are on the job today helping to get the nation's air system operating safely.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_009.wav|In the New York area for example, four supervisors were scheduled to report for work and 17 additionally volunteered.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_010.wav|At National Airport, a traffic controller told a newsperson he had resigned from the union and reported to work because, quote, how can I ask my kids to obey the law if I don't?
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_011.wav|This is a great tribute to America.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_012.wav|Let me make one thing plain.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_013.wav|I respect the right of workers in the private sector to strike.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_014.wav|Indeed, as president of my own union, I led the first strike ever called by that union.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_015.wav|I guess I'm maybe the first one to ever hold this office who is a lifetime member of an AF of LCIO union.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_016.wav|But we cannot compare labor management relations in the private sector with government.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_017.wav|Government cannot close down the assembly line.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_018.wav|It has to provide without interruption the protective services which are government's reason for being.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_019.wav|It was in recognition of this that the Congress passed a law forbidding strikes by government employees against the public safety.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_020.wav|Let me read the solemn oath taken by each of these employees, Miss Warren-Affed David, when they accepted their jobs.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_021.wav|I am not participating in any strike against the government of the United States or any agency thereof, and I will not so participate while an employee of the government of the United States or any agency thereof.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_022.wav|It is for this reason that I must tell those who failed a report for duty this morning.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_023.wav|They are in violation of the law, and if they do not report for work within 48 hours, they have forfeited their jobs and will be terminated.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_024.wav|End of statement.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_001.wav|I've spoken to you from this historic office on many occasions and about many things.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_002.wav|The power of the presidency is often thought to reside within this oval office.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_003.wav|Yet it doesn't rest here.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_004.wav|It rests in you, the American people, and in your trust.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_005.wav|Your trust is what gives the president his powers of leadership and his personal strength, and it's what I want to talk to you about this evening.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_006.wav|For the past three months, I've been silent on the revelations about Iran, and you must have been thinking, well, why doesn't he tell us what's happening?
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_007.wav|Why doesn't he just speak to us as he has in the past when we've faced troubles or tragedies?
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_008.wav|Others of you, I guess, were thinking, what's he doing, hiding out in the White House?
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_009.wav|Well, the reason I haven't spoken to you before now is this.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_010.wav|You deserve the truth, and as frustrating as the waiting has been, I felt it was improper to come to you with sketchy reports or possibly even erroneous statements, which would then have to be corrected creating even more doubt and confusion.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_011.wav|There's been enough of that.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_012.wav|I paid a price for my silence in terms of your trust and confidence, but I've had to wait as you have for the complete story.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_013.wav|That's why I appointed Ambassador David Abshire as my special consular to help get out the thousands of documents to the various investigations, and I appointed a special review board, the Tower Board, which took on the chore of pulling the truth together for me and getting to the bottom of things.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_014.wav|It has now issued its findings.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_015.wav|I'm often accused of being an optimist, and it's true I had to hunt pretty hard to find any good news in the Board's report.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_016.wav|As you know, it's well stocked with criticisms, which I'll discuss in a moment, but I was very relieved to read this sentence.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_017.wav|The Board is convinced that the President doesn't, indeed, want the full story to be told, and that will continue to be my pledge to you as the other investigations go forward.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_018.wav|I want to thank the members of the panel, former John, Senator John Tower, former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie, and former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_019.wav|They have done the nation, as well as me personally, a great service by submitting a report of such integrity and depth.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_020.wav|They have my genuine and enduring gratitude.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_021.wav|I've studied the Board's report, its findings are honest, convincing, and highly critical, and I accept them.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_022.wav|And tonight, I want to share with you my thoughts on these findings, and report to you on the actions I'm taking to implement the Board's recommendations.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_023.wav|First, let me say I take full responsibility for my own actions, and for those of my administration.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_024.wav|As angry as I may be about activities undertaken without my knowledge, I am still accountable for those activities.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_025.wav|As disappointed as I may be in some who serve me, I am still the one who must answer to the American people for this behavior.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_026.wav|And as personally distasteful as I find secret bank accounts and diverted funds, what does the Navy would say?
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_027.wav|This happened on my watch.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_028.wav|Let's start with the part that is the most controversial.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_029.wav|A few months ago, I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_030.wav|My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_031.wav|As the Tower Board reported, what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated in its implementation into trading arms for hostages.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_032.wav|This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_033.wav|There are reasons why it happened, but no excuses.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_034.wav|It was a mistake.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_035.wav|I undertook the original Iran initiative in order to develop relations with those who might assume leadership in a post-Homany government.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_036.wav|It's clear from the Board's report, however, that I let my personal concern for the hostages spill over into the geopolitical strategy of reaching out to Iran.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_037.wav|I asked so many questions about the hostages' welfare that I didn't ask enough about the specifics of the total Iran plan.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_038.wav|Let me say to the hostage families, we have not given up.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_039.wav|We never will, and I promise you will use every legitimate means to free your loved ones from captivity.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_040.wav|But I must also caution that those Americans who freely remain in such dangerous areas must know that they're responsible for their own safety.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_041.wav|Now, another major aspect of the Board's findings regards the transfer of funds to the Nicaraguan Contras.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_042.wav|The Tower Board wasn't able to find out what happened to this money.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_043.wav|So the facts here will be left to the continuing investigations of the court appointed independent council and the two congressional investigating committees.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_044.wav|I'm confident the truth will come out about this matter as well.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_045.wav|As I told the Tower Board, I didn't know about any diversion of funds to the Contras, but as President, I cannot escape responsibility.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_046.wav|Much has been said about my management style, a style that's worked successfully for me during eight years as Governor of California and for most of my presidency.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_047.wav|The way I work is to identify the problem, find the right individuals to do the job, and then let them go to it.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_048.wav|I found this invariably brings out the best in people.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_049.wav|They seem to rise to their full capability and in the long run, you get more done.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_050.wav|When it came to managing the NSC staff, let's face it, my style didn't match its previous track record.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_051.wav|I've already begun correcting this.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_052.wav|As a start yesterday, I met with the entire professional staff of the National Security Council.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_053.wav|I defined for them the values I want to guide the National Security policies of this country.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_054.wav|I told them that I wanted a policy that was as justifiable and understandable in public as it was in secret.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_055.wav|I wanted a policy that reflected the will of the Congress as well as the White House, and I told them that there will be no more freelancing by individuals when it comes to our National Security.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_056.wav|You've heard a lot about the staff of the National Security Council in recent months.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_057.wav|Well, I can tell you they are good and dedicated government employees who put in long hours for the nation's benefit.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_058.wav|They are eager and anxious to serve their country.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_059.wav|One thing still upsetting me, however, is that no one kept proper records of meetings or decisions.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_060.wav|This led to my failure to recollect whether I approved an arm shipment before or after the fact.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_061.wav|I did approve it.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_062.wav|I just can't say specifically when.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_063.wav|Well, rest assured there's plenty of record keeping now going on at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_064.wav|For nearly a week now, I've been studying the Board's report.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_065.wav|I want the American people to know that this wrenching ordeal of recent months has not been in vain.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_066.wav|I endorse every one of the tower board's recommendations.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_067.wav|In fact, I'm going beyond its recommendations so as to put the house in even better order.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_068.wav|I'm taking action in three basic areas.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_069.wav|Personnel, National Security Policy, and the process for making sure that the system works.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_070.wav|First, personnel.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_071.wav|I've brought in an accomplished and highly respected new team here at the White House.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_072.wav|They bring new blood, new energy, and new credibility and experience.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_073.wav|Former Senator Howard Baker, my new Chief of Staff possesses a breadth of legislative and foreign affairs skills that's impossible to match.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_074.wav|I'm hopeful that his experience as minority and majority leader of the Senate can help us forge a new partnership with the Congress, especially on foreign and national security policies.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_075.wav|I'm genuinely honored that he's given up his own presidential aspirations to serve the country as my Chief of Staff.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_076.wav|Frank Karlochi, my new National Security Advisor, is respected for his experience in government and trusted for his judgment and counsel.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_077.wav|Under him, the NSC staff is being rebuilt with proper management discipline.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_078.wav|Already, almost half the NSC professional staff is comprised of new people.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_079.wav|Yesterday, I nominated William Webster, a man of sterling reputation, to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_080.wav|Mr. Webster has served as director of the FBI and as a U.S. District Court judge.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_081.wav|He understands the meaning of rule of law.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_082.wav|So that his knowledge of national security matters can be available to me on a continuing basis.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_083.wav|I will also appoint John Tower to serve as a member of my Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_084.wav|I am considering other changes in personnel and I'll move more furniture as I see fit in the weeks and months ahead.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_085.wav|Second, in the area of national security policy, I have ordered the NSC to begin a comprehensive review of all covert operations.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_086.wav|I have also directed that any covert activity be in support of clear policy objectives and in compliance with American values.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_087.wav|I expect a covert policy that if Americans saw it on the front page of their newspaper, they'd say that makes sense.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_088.wav|I have had issued a directive prohibiting the NSC staff itself from undertaking covert operations.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_089.wav|No ifs, ends, or buts.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_090.wav|I have asked Vice President Bush to reconvene his task force on terrorism, to review our terrorist policy in light of the events that have occurred.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_091.wav|Third, in terms of the process of reaching national security decisions, I am adopting in total the Tower Reports model of how the NSC process is.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_092.wav|I am directing Mr. Carlucci to take the necessary steps to make that happen.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_093.wav|He will report back to me on further reforms that might be needed.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_094.wav|I have created the post of NSC legal advisor to assure a greater sensitivity to matters of law.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_095.wav|I am also determined to make the congressional oversight process work.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_096.wav|Proper procedures for consultation with the Congress will be followed not only in letter but in spirit.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_097.wav|Before the end of March, I will report to the Congress on all the steps I've taken in line with the Tower Board's conclusions.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_098.wav|Now, what should happen when you make a mistake is this.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_099.wav|You take your knocks, you learn your lessons, and then you move on.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_100.wav|That's the healthiest way to deal with the problem.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_101.wav|There's no way to diminish the importance of the other continuing investigations, but the business of our country and our people must proceed.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_102.wav|I've gotten this message from Republicans and Democrats in Congress, from allies around the world, and if we're reading the signals right, even from the Soviets.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_103.wav|And of course, I've heard the message from you, the American people.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_104.wav|You know, for the time you reach my age, you've made plenty of mistakes.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_105.wav|And if you've lived your life properly, so you learn.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_106.wav|You put things in perspective.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_107.wav|You pull your energies together, you change, you go forward.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_108.wav|I'm Federal Americans.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_109.wav|I have a great deal that I want to accomplish with you and for you over the next two years.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_110.wav|And the Lord willing, that's exactly what I intend to do.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_111.wav|Good night and God bless you.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_001.wav|this painful walk into the past has done much more than remind us of the war that consumed the European continent.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_002.wav|What we have seen makes unforgettable clear that no one of the rest of us can fully understand the enormity of the feelings carried by the victims of these camps.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_003.wav|The survivors carry a memory beyond anything that we can comprehend.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_004.wav|The awful evil started by one man, an evil that victimized all the world with its destruction, was uniquely destructive of the millions forced into the grim abyss of these camps.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_005.wav|Here lie people, Jews whose death was inflicted for no reason other than their very existence.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_006.wav|Their pain was born only because of who they were and because of the God in their prayers, alongside them lay many Christians, Catholics and Protestants.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_007.wav|For year after year, until that man and his evil were destroyed, hell yond forth its awful contents.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_008.wav|People were brought here for no other purpose, but to suffer and die.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_009.wav|To go unfed when hungry, uncared for when sick, tortured when the whim struck and left to have misery consume them when all there was around them was misery.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_010.wav|I'm sure we all share similar first thoughts.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_011.wav|That is what of the youngsters who died at this dark stall.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_012.wav|All was gone for them forever, not to feel again the warmth of life sunshine and promise, not the laughter and the splendid ache of growing up, nor the consoling embrace of a family.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_013.wav|Try to think of being young and never having a day without searing emotional and physical pain, desolate, unreleaved pain.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_014.wav|Today we've been grimly reminded why the commandant of this camp was named the Beast of Belson.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_015.wav|Above all, we are struck by the horror of it all, the monstrous, incomprehensible horror.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_016.wav|And that's what we've seen, but is what we can never understand as the victims did.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_017.wav|Nor with all our compassion can we feel what the survivors feel to this day and what they will feel as long as they live.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_018.wav|What we've felt and are expressing with words cannot convey the suffering that they endured.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_019.wav|And that is why history will forever brand what happened as the Holocaust.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_020.wav|Here death ruled, but we've learned something as well.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_021.wav|Because of what happened, we found that death cannot rule forever.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_022.wav|And that's why we're here today.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_023.wav|We're here because humanity refuses to accept that freedom of the spirit of man can ever be extinguished.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_024.wav|We're here to commemorate that life triumphed over the tragedy and the death of the Holocaust overcame the suffering, the sickness, the testing, and yes, the gassings.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_025.wav|Out of the ashes, hope, and from all the pain promise.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_026.wav|So much of this is symbolized today by the fact that most of the leadership of free Germany is represented here today.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_027.wav|Chancellor Coral, you and your countrymen have made real the renewal that had to happen.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_028.wav|Your nation and the German people have been strong and resolute in your willingness to confront and condemn the acts of a hated regime of the past.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_029.wav|This reflects the courage of your people and their devotion to freedom and justice since the war.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_030.wav|Think how far we've come from that time when despair made these tragic victims wonder if anything could survive.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_031.wav|As we flew here from Hanover, low over the greening farms and the emerging springtime with the lovely German countryside, I reflected and there must have been a time when the prisoners at Burger Belson and those of every other camp must have felt the springtime was gone forever from their lives.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_032.wav|Surely we can understand that when we see what is around us.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_033.wav|All these children of God under bleak and lifeless mounds, the planeness of which does not even hint at the unspeakable acts that created them.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_034.wav|Here they lie, never to hope, never to pray, never to love, never to heal, never to laugh, never to cry.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_035.wav|And too many of them knew that this was their fate, but that was not the end.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_036.wav|Through it all was their faith and a spirit that moved their faith.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_037.wav|Nothing illustrates this better than the story of a young girl who died here at Burger Bellson.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_038.wav|For more than two years and Frank and her family had hidden from the Nazis in a confined annex in Holland where she kept a remarkably profound diary.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_039.wav|Betrayed by an informant and her family were sent by freight car first to Auschwitz and finally here to Burger Bellson.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_040.wav|Just three weeks before her capture, young Anne wrote these words,
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_041.wav|it's really a wonder that I haven't dropped all my ideals because they seem so absurd and impossible to carry out.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_042.wav|Yet I keep them because in spite of everything, I still believe that people are good at heart.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_043.wav|I simply can't build up my hopes on a foundation consisting of confusion, misery, and death.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_044.wav|I see the world gradually being turned into a wilderness.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_045.wav|I hear the ever approaching thunder which will destroy us too.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_046.wav|I can feel the suffering of millions.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_047.wav|And yet, if I looked up into the heavens, I think that it will all come right.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_048.wav|That this cruelty too will end and that peace and tranquility will return again.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_049.wav|Eight months later, this sparkling young life ended here at Burger Bellson.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_050.wav|Somewhere here lies Anne Frank.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_051.wav|Everywhere here are memories pulling us, touching us, making us understand that they can never be erased.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_052.wav|Such memories take us where God intended His children to go toward learning, toward healing, and above all, toward redemption.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_053.wav|They beckon us through the endless stretches of our heart to the knowing commitment that the life of each individual can change the world and make it better.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_054.wav|We're all witnesses.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_055.wav|We share the glistening hope that rests in every human soul.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_056.wav|Hope leads us if we're prepared to trust it, toward what our President Lincoln called the better angels of our nature.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_057.wav|And then rising above all this cruelty, out of this tragic and nightmarish time, beyond the anguish the pain of the suffering for all time, we can and must pledge.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_058.wav|Never again.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_001.wav|Douglass McCartner made an unforgettable farewell to the country he loved and served so well.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_002.wav|Dwight Eisenhower reminded us that peace was purchased only at the price of strength and John F. Kennedy spoke of the burden and glory that is freedom.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_003.wav|When I visited this chamber last year as a newcomer to Washington, critical past policies which I believe it failed, I proposed a new spirit of partnership between this congress and this administration and between Washington and our state and local governments.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_004.wav|In forging this new partnership for America, we could achieve the oldest hopes of our republic, prosperity for our nation, peace for the world, and the blessings of individual liberty for our children, and someday for all of humanity.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_005.wav|It's my duty to report to you tonight on the progress that we have made in our relations with other nations.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_006.wav|On the foundation we carefully laid for our economic recovery, and finally on a bold and spirited initiative that I believe can change the face of American government and make it again the servant of the people.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_007.wav|Seldom have the stakes been higher for America.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_008.wav|What we do and say here will make all the difference to auto workers in Detroit, lumberjacks in the northwest, steel workers in Stubenville who are in the unemployment lines, to black teenagers in Newark and Chicago, to hard pressed farmers and small businessmen, and to millions of everyday Americans who harbor the simple wish of a safe and financially secure future for their children.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_009.wav|To understand the state of the union, we must look not only at where we are and where we're going, but where we've been.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_010.wav|The situation at this time last year was truly ominous.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_011.wav|The last decade has seen a series of recessions.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_012.wav|There was a recession in 1970, in 1974, and again in the spring of 1980.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_013.wav|Each time unemployment increased and inflation soon turned up again.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_014.wav|We coined the word stagflation to describe this.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_015.wav|Government's response to these recessions was to pump up the money supply and increase spending.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_016.wav|In the last six months of 1980 as an example, the money supply increased to the fastest rate in post-war history, 13%.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_017.wav|Inflation remained in double digits, and government spending increased at an annual rate of 17%.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_018.wav|Interest rates reached a staggering 21.5%.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_019.wav|There were 8 million unemployed.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_020.wav|Late in 1981, we sank into the present recession, largely because continued high interest rates hurt the auto industry and construction, and there was a drop in productivity and the already high unemployment increased.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_021.wav|This time, however, things are different.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_022.wav|We have an economic program in place, completely different from the artificial quick fixes of the past.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_023.wav|It calls for a reduction of the rate of increase in government spending, and already that rate has been cut nearly in half.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_024.wav|But reduced spending alone isn't enough.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_025.wav|We've just implemented the first and smallest phase of a three-year tax rate reduction designed to stimulate the economy and create jobs.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_026.wav|Already, interest rates are down to 15 and 3.25%, but they must still go lower.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_027.wav|Inflation is down from 12.4% to 8.9, and for the month of December, it was running at an annualized rate of 5.2%.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_028.wav|If we had not acted as we did, a year ago, Americans' faith in their governmental process was steadily declining.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_029.wav|Six out of 10 Americans were saying they were pessimistic about their future.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_030.wav|A new kind of defeatism was heard.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_031.wav|Some said our domestic problems were uncontrollable, that we had to learn to live with this seemingly endless cycle of high inflation and high unemployment.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_032.wav|There were also pessimistic predictions about the relationship between our administration and this Congress.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_033.wav|It was said we could never work together.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_034.wav|Well, those predictions were wrong.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_035.wav|The record is clear, and I believe that history will remember this as an era of American renewal, remember this administration as an administration of change, and remember this Congress as a Congress of destiny.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_036.wav|Together we not only cut the increase in government spending nearly in half, we brought about the largest tax reductions in the most sweeping changes in our tax structure since the beginning of this century.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_037.wav|And because we in to the rate of inflation, we took away governments built in profit on inflation, and it's hidden and said it to grow larger at the expense of American workers.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_038.wav|Together, after 50 years of taking power away from the hands of the people in their states and local communities, we have started returning power and resources to them.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_039.wav|Together, we have cut the growth of new federal regulations nearly in half.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_040.wav|In 1981, there were 23,000 fewer pages in the federal register which lists new regulations.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_041.wav|We've come closer to achieving energy independence and help bring down the cost of gasoline and heating fuel.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_042.wav|Together, we have created an effective federal strike force to combat waste and fraud in government.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_043.wav|In just six months, it has saved the taxpayers more than $2 billion and it's only getting started.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_044.wav|Together, we've begun to mobilize the private sector, not to duplicate wasteful and discredited government programs, but to bring thousands of Americans into a volunteer effort to help solve many of America's social problems.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_045.wav|Together, we've begun to restore that margin of military safety that ensures peace.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_046.wav|Our country's uniform is being worn once again with pride.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_047.wav|We have made a new beginning, but we have only begun.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_048.wav|No one pretends that the way ahead will be easy.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_049.wav|And I, in all due to the dress last year, I warned that the ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_050.wav|They will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will go away because we as Americans have the capacity now, as we've had it in the past, to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_051.wav|But the program for economic recovery that is in place will pull the economy out of its slump and put us on the road to prosperity and stable growth by the latter half of this year.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_052.wav|And that is why I can report to you tonight that in the near future, the state of the union and the economy will be better, much better.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_053.wav|If we summon the strength to continue on the course that we've charted.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_054.wav|And so the question, if the fundamentals are in place, what now?
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_055.wav|With two things.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_056.wav|First, we must understand what's happening at the moment to the economy.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_057.wav|Our current problems are not the product of the recovery program that's only just now getting underway.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_058.wav|Some would have you believe.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_059.wav|They are the inheritance of decades of tax and tax and spend and spend.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_060.wav|Second, because our economic problems are deeply rooted and will not respond to quick political fixes, we must stick to our carefully integrated plan for recovery.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_061.wav|And that plan is based on four common-sense fundamentals.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_062.wav|Continued reduction of the growth in federal spending, preserving the individual and business tax reductions that will stimulate saving and investment, removing unnecessary federal regulations to spark productivity and maintaining a healthy dollar and a stable monetary policy, the latter a responsibility of the federal reserve system.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_063.wav|The only alternative being offered to this economic program is a return to the policies that gave us a trillion dollar debt, runaway inflation, runaway interest rates, and unemployment.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_064.wav|The doubters would have us turned back the clock with tax increases that would offset the personal tax rate reductions already passed by this Congress.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_065.wav|Raise present taxes to cut future deficits they tell us.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_066.wav|Well, I don't believe we should buy that argument.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_067.wav|There are too many imponderables for anyone to predict deficits or surplus as several years ahead with any degree of accuracy.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_068.wav|The budget is placed when I took office it has been projected as balanced.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_069.wav|It turned out to have one of the biggest deficits in history.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_070.wav|Another example of the imponderables that can make deficit projections highly questionable, a change of only one percentage point in unemployment can alter a deficit up or down by some $25 billion.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_071.wav|As it now stands, our forecasts, which were required by law to make, will show major deficits starting at less than $100 billion and declining, but still too high.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_072.wav|More important, we're making progress with the three keys to reducing deficits, economic growth, lower interest rates, and spending control.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_073.wav|The policies we have in place will reduce the deficits steadily, surely, and in time, completely.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_074.wav|Higher taxes would not mean lower deficits.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_075.wav|If they did, how would we explain the tax redoubled just since 1976, yet in that same six-year period we ran the largest series of deficits in our history.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_076.wav|In 1980 tax revenues increased by $54 billion and in 1980 we had one of our all-time biggest deficits.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_077.wav|Raising taxes won't balance the budget.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_078.wav|It will encourage more government spending and less private investment.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_079.wav|Raising taxes will slow economic growth, redo production, and destroy future jobs, making it more difficult for those without jobs to find them, and more likely that those who now have jobs could lose them.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_080.wav|So to provide them incentives to rebuild our economy, to save, to invest in America's future, I will stand by my word.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_081.wav|Tonight I'm urging the American people seize these new opportunities to produce, to save, to invest, and together we'll make this economy.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_082.wav|And the continued high interest rates last year cost the government about $5 billion more than anticipated.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_083.wav|We must cut out more non-essential government spending and root out more waste and we will continue our efforts to reduce the number of employees in the federal workforce by 75,000.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_084.wav|The budget plan I submit to you on February 8th will realize major savings by dismantling the departments of energy and education and by eliminating ineffective subsidies for business.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_085.wav|We will continue to redirect our resources to our two highest budget priorities.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_086.wav|A strong national defense to keep America free and at peace, and a reliable safety net of social programs for those who have contributed and those who are in need.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_087.wav|Contrary to some of the wild charges you may have heard, this administration has not and will not turn its back on America's elderly or America's poor.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_088.wav|Funding for social insurance programs will be more than double the amount spent only six years ago.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_089.wav|But it would be foolish to pretend that these or any programs cannot be made more efficient and economical.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_090.wav|The entitlement programs that make up our safety net for the truly needy have worthy goals and many deserving recipients.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_091.wav|We will protect them.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_092.wav|But there's only one way to see to it that these programs really help those whom they were designed to help and that is to bring their spiraling costs under control.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_093.wav|Today we face the absurd situation of a federal budget with three quarters of its expenditures routinely referred to as uncontrollable and a large part of this goes to entitlement programs.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_094.wav|Committee after committee of this Congress has heard witness after witness describe many of these programs as poorly administered and ripe with waste and fraud.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_095.wav|Virtually every American who shops in a local supermarket is aware of the daily abuses that take place in the food stock stamp program which has grown by 16,000 percent in the last 15 years.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_096.wav|Another example is Medicare and Medicaid programs with worthy goals.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_097.wav|But whose costs have increased from 11.2 billion to almost 60 billion more than five times as much in just 10 years.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_098.wav|Waste and fraud and our serious problems.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_099.wav|Back in 1980, federal investigators testified before one of your committees that corruption has permeated virtually every area of the Medicare and Medicaid healthcare industry.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_100.wav|One official said many of the people who were cheating the system were very confident that nothing was going to happen to them.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_101.wav|Well something is going to happen.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_102.wav|Not only the taxpayers are defrauded, the people with real dependency on these programs are deprived of what they need because available resources are going not to the needy but to the greedy.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_103.wav|The time has come to control the uncontrollable.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_104.wav|In August we made a start.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_105.wav|I signed a bill to reduce the growth of these programs by $44 billion over the next three years.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_106.wav|By the same time preserving essential services for the truly needy.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_107.wav|Shortly you will receive from me a message on further reforms we intend to install.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_108.wav|Some new but others long recommended by your own congressional committees.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_109.wav|I ask you to help make these savings for the American taxpayer.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_110.wav|The savings we propose in entitlement programs will total some $63 billion over four years and will without affecting social security go a long way toward bringing federal spending under control.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_111.wav|But don't be fooled by those who proclaim that spending cuts will deprive the elderly the needy and the helpless.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_112.wav|The federal government will still subsidize 95 million meals every day.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_113.wav|That's one out of seven of all the meals served in America.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_114.wav|Head start, senior nutrition programs and child welfare programs will not be cut from the levels we proposed last year.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_115.wav|More than one half billion dollars has been proposed for minority business assistance and researchers at the National Institute of Health will be increased by over a hundred million dollars.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_116.wav|While meeting all these needs we intend to plug unwarranted tax loop poles and strengthen the law which requires all large corporations to pay will protect the needy while it triggers a recovery that will benefit all Americans.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_117.wav|It will stimulate the economy, result in increased savings and provide capital for expansion, mortgages for home building and jobs for the unemployed.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_118.wav|Now that the essentials of that program are in place, our next major undertaking must be a program just as bold, just as innovative to make government again accountable to the people, to make our system of federalism work again.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_119.wav|Our citizens feel they've lost control of even the most basic decisions made about the essential services of government, such as schools, welfare, roads and even garbage collection.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_120.wav|And they're right.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_121.wav|A maze of interlocking jurisdictions and levels of government confronts average citizens in trying to solve even the simplest of problems.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_122.wav|They don't know where to turn for answers, who to hold accountable, who to praise, who to blame, who to go for or against.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_123.wav|The main reason for this is the overpowering growth of federal grants in eight programs during the past few decades.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_124.wav|In 1960 the federal government had 132 categorical grant programs costing seven billion dollars.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_125.wav|When I took office there were approximately 500 costing nearly a hundred billion dollars.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_126.wav|13 programs for energy.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_127.wav|36 for pollution control.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_128.wav|66 for social services.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_129.wav|90 for education.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_130.wav|And here in the Congress it takes at least 166 committees just to try to keep track of them.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_131.wav|You know and I know that neither the President nor the Congress can properly oversee this jungle of grants in aid.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_132.wav|Indeed the growth of these grants has led to the distortion in the vital functions of government.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_133.wav|As one democratic governor put it recently the national government should be worrying about arms control, more intrusive, more unmanageable, more ineffective and costly and above all more accountable.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_134.wav|Well let's solve this problem with a single bull stroke.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_135.wav|The return of some 47 billion dollars in federal programs to state and local government together with the means to finance them and a transition period of nearly 10 years to avoid unnecessary disruption.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_136.wav|I will shortly send this Congress a message describing this program.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_137.wav|I want to emphasize however that its full details will have been worked out only after close consultation with congressional, state and local officials.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_138.wav|Starting in fiscal 1984 the federal government will assume full responsibility for the cost of the rapidly growing Medicaid program to go along with its existing responsibility for Medicare.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_139.wav|As part of a financially equal swap the states will simultaneously take full responsibility for aid to families with dependent children and food stamps and the people it serves.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_140.wav|In 1984 the federal government will apply the full proceeds from certain excise taxes to a grassroots trust fund that will belong in fair shares to the 50 states.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_141.wav|The total amount flowing into this fund will be $28 billion a year.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_142.wav|Over the next four years the states can use this money in either of two ways.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_143.wav|If they want to continue receiving federal grants in such areas as transportation, education and social services they can use their trust fund money to pay for the grants or to the extent they choose to forgo the federal grant programs they can use their trust fund money on their own for those or other purposes.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_144.wav|There will be a mandatory pass-through of part of these funds to local governments.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_145.wav|By 1988 the states will be in complete control of over 40 federal grant programs.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_146.wav|The trust fund will start to phase out eventually to disappear and the excise taxes will be turned over to the states.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_147.wav|They can then preserve lower or raised taxes on their own and fund and manage these programs as they see fit.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_148.wav|In a single stroke we will be accomplishing a realignment that will end Congress of Administration and Spiraling Cod while we ensure these programs will be more responsive to both the people they are meant to help and the people who pay for them.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_149.wav|Hand in hand with this program to strengthen the discretion and flexibility of state and local governments.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_150.wav|We are proposing legislation for an experimental effort to improve and develop our depressed urban areas in the 1990s.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_151.wav|This legislation will permit states and localities to apply to the federal government for designation as urban enterprise zones.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_152.wav|A broad range of special economic incentives in the zones will help attract new business, new jobs, new opportunity to America's inner cities and rural towns.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_153.wav|Some will say our mission is to save free enterprise.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_154.wav|While I say we must free enterprise so that together that might have been true 20 years ago before reforms like reapportionment and the Voting Rights Act, the 10-year extension of which I strongly support is no longer true today.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_155.wav|This administration has faith in state and local governments and the constitutional balance in vision to the founding fathers.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_156.wav|We also believe in the integrity, decency and sound good sense of grassroots Americans.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_157.wav|Our faith in the American people is reflected in another major endeavor.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_158.wav|Our private sector initiatives task force is seeking out successful community models of school, church, business, union, foundation and civic programs that help community needs.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_159.wav|Such groups are almost invariably far more efficient than government in running social programs.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_160.wav|We are not asking them to replace discarded and often discredited government programs dollar for dollar service for service.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_161.wav|We just want to help them perform the good works they choose and help others to profit by their example.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_162.wav|385,000 corporations and private organizations are already working on social programs ranging from drug rehabilitation to job training and thousands more Americans have written us asking how they can help.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_163.wav|The volunteer spirit is still alive and well in America for all our citizens.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_164.wav|Once a source of discord, now a source of pride must continue with no backsliding or slowing down.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_165.wav|We must and shall see that those basic laws that guarantee equal rights are preserved and when necessary strengthen.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_166.wav|Our concern for equal rights for women is firm and unshakable.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_167.wav|We launched a new task force on legal equity for women and a 50 states project that will examine state laws for discriminatory language and for the first time in our history, a woman sits one as real and deadly serious as any in America today.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_168.wav|It demands that we seek transformation of our legal system which overly protects the rights of criminals while it leaves society in the innocent victims of crime without justice.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_169.wav|We look forward to the enactment of a responsible clean air act to increase jobs while continuing to improve the quality of our air.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_170.wav|We're encouraged by the bipartisan initiative of the House and are hopeful of further progress as the Senate continues its deliberations.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_171.wav|So far, I've concentrated largely now on domestic matters.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_172.wav|To view the state of the union and perspective, we must not ignore the rest of the world.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_173.wav|There isn't time to night for a lengthy treatment of social or foreign policy, I should say.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_174.wav|A subject I intend to address in detail in the near future.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_175.wav|A few words, however, are in order on the progress we've made over the past year, reestablishing respect for our nation around the globe and some of the challenges and goals that we will approach in the year ahead.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_176.wav|At Ottawa and Concoune, I met with leaders of the major industrial powers and developing nations.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_177.wav|Now, some of those I met were a little surprised that I didn't apologize for America's wealth.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_178.wav|Instead, I spoke of the strength of the free marketplace system and how that system could help them realize their aspirations for economic development and political freedom.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_179.wav|I believe lasting friendships were made and the foundation was laid for future cooperation.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_180.wav|In the vital region of the Caribbean Basin, we're developing a program of aid, trade and investment incentives to promote self-sustaining growth and a better, more secure life for our neighbors to the south.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_181.wav|Toward those who would export terrorism and subversion the Caribbean and elsewhere, especially Cuba and Libya, we will act with firmness.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_182.wav|Our foreign policy is a policy of strength, fairness and balance.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_183.wav|By restoring America's military credibility, by pursuing peace at the negotiating table, wherever to sit down in good faith, and by beginning or regaining the respect of America's allies and adversaries alike, we have strengthened our country's position as a force for peace and progress in the world.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_184.wav|When action is called for, we're taking our sanctions against the military dictatorship that is attempted to crush human rights in Poland and against the Soviet regime behind that military dictatorship, clearly demonstrated to the world that America will not conduct business as usual with the forces of oppression.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_185.wav|Continue to deteriorate further deteriorate.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_186.wav|Further measures will follow.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_187.wav|Now let me also note that private American groups have taken the lead in making January 30th a day of solidarity with the people of Poland.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_188.wav|So too, the European Parliament has called for March 21st to be an international day of support for Afghanistan.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_189.wav|I urge all peace-loving peoples to join together on those days, to raise their voices, to speak and pray for freedom.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_190.wav|Meanwhile, we're working for reduction of arms and military activities, as I announced in my address to the nation last November 18th.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_191.wav|We have proposed to the Soviet Union a far-reaching agenda for mutual reduction of military forces and have already initiated negotiations with them in Geneva on intermediate-range nuclear forces.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_192.wav|In those talks, it is essential that we negotiate from a position of strength.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_193.wav|There must be a real incentive for the Soviets to take these talks seriously.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_194.wav|This requires that we rebuild our defenses.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_195.wav|In the last decade, while we sought the moderation of Soviet power through a process of restraint and accommodation, the Soviets engaged in an unrelenting build-up of their military forces.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_196.wav|The protection of our national security has required that we undertake a substantial program to enhance our military forces.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_197.wav|We have not neglected to strengthen our traditional alliances in Europe and Asia, or to develop key relationships with our partners in the Middle East and other countries.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_198.wav|Building a more peaceful world requires a sound strategy and the national resolve to back it up.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_199.wav|When radical forces threaten our fend friends, when economic misfortune creates conditions of instability, when strategically vital parts of the world fall under the shadow of Soviet power, our response can make the difference between peaceful change or disorder and violence.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_200.wav|That's why we've laid such stress not only on our own defense, but on our vital foreign assistance program.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_201.wav|Your recent passage at the Foreign Assistance Act sent a signal to the world that America will not shrink from making the investments necessary for both peace and security.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_202.wav|Our foreign policy must be rooted in realism, not naivete or self-delusion.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_203.wav|A recognition of what the Soviet Empire is about is the starting point.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_204.wav|Winston Churchill and negotiating with the Soviets observed that they respect only strength and resolve in their dealings with other nations.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_205.wav|That's why we've moved to reconstruct our national defenses.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_206.wav|We intend to keep the peace.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_207.wav|We will also keep our freedom.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_208.wav|In the face of a climate of falsehood and misinformation, we've promised the world a season of truth.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_209.wav|The truth of our great civilized ideas, individual liberty, representative government, the rule of law under God.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_210.wav|We've never needed walls or minefields or barbed wire to keep our people in, nor do we declare martial law to keep our people from voting for the kind of government they want.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_211.wav|Yes, we have our problems.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_212.wav|Yes, we're in a time of recession.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_213.wav|And as true, there's no quick fix as I said to instantly end the tragic pain of unemployment.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_214.wav|But we will end it.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_215.wav|The process has already begun and we'll see its effect as the year goes on.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_216.wav|We speak with pride and admiration of that little band of Americans who overcame insuperable odds to set this nation on course 200 years ago.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_217.wav|But our glory didn't end with them.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_218.wav|Americans ever since have emulated their deeds.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_219.wav|We don't have to turn to our history books for heroes.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_220.wav|They're all around us.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_221.wav|One who sits among you here tonight, he put a wise that heroism at the end of the longest imprisonment ever inflicted on men of our armed forces.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_222.wav|Who will ever forget that night when we waited for television to bring us the scene of that first plane landing at Clark Field in the Philippines, bringing our POWs home.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_223.wav|The plane door opened and Jeremiah Deppin came slowly down the ramp.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_224.wav|He caught sight of our flag, saluted it, said God bless America in the midst of a terrible tragedy on the Potomac.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_225.wav|We saw again the spirit of American heroism at its finest.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_226.wav|The heroism of dedicated rescue workers saving crash victims from icy waters.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_227.wav|And we saw the heroism of one of our young government employees, Lenny Scottning, who when he saw a woman loser grip on the helicopter line, dived into the water, heroes of a American life.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_228.wav|Parents who sacrifice long and hard so their children will know a better life than they've known.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_229.wav|Church and civic volunteers who helped to feed, cloth, nurse and teach the needy.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_230.wav|Millions who've made our nation and our nation's destiny so very special.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_231.wav|Unsung heroes who may not have realized their own dreams themselves, but then who reinvest those dreams in their children.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_232.wav|Don't let anyone tell you that America's best days are behind her, that the American spirit has been vanquished.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_233.wav|We've seen a triumphant of our lives, the greatest of all our presidents, delivered his second state of the Union message in this chamber.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_234.wav|We cannot escape history, Abraham Lincoln warned.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_235.wav|We of this Congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_236.wav|The trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_237.wav|Well, that president and that Congress did not fail the American people.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_238.wav|Together they weathered the storm and preserved the Union.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_239.wav|Let it be said of us that we too did not fail.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_240.wav|That we too worked together to bring America through difficult times.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_241.wav|Let us so conduct ourselves that two centuries from now, another Congress and another president meeting in this chamber as we're meeting, will speak of us with pride, saying that we met the test and preserved for them in their day the sacred flame of liberty, this last best hope of man on earth.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_001.wav|uh, my fellow Americans, thank you for sharing your time with me tonight.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_002.wav|For subject I want to discuss with you, peace and national security is both timely and important, timely because I have reached a decision which offers a new hope for our children in the 21st century.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_003.wav|A decision I'll tell you about in a few minutes, and important because there's a very big decision that you must make for yourselves.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_004.wav|This subject involves the most basic duty that any president and any people share, the duty to protect and strengthen the peace.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_005.wav|At the beginning of this year, I submitted to the Congress at Defense Budget, which reflects my best judgment of the best understanding of the experts and specialists who advise me about what we and our allies must do to protect our people in the years ahead.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_006.wav|That budget is much more than a long list of numbers.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_007.wav|From behind all the numbers lies America's ability to prevent the greatest of human tragedies and preserve our free way of life in a sometimes dangerous world.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_008.wav|It is part of a careful long-term plan to make America strong again after too many years of neglect and mistakes.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_009.wav|Our efforts to rebuild America's defenses and strengthen the peace began two years ago when we requested a major increase in the defense program.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_010.wav|Since then, the amount of those increases we first proposed has been reduced by half through improvements in management and procurement and other savings.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_011.wav|The budget request that is now before the Congress has been trimmed to the limits of safety.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_012.wav|Further deep cuts cannot be made without seriously endangering the security of the nation.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_013.wav|The choice is up to the men and women you've elected to the Congress, and that means the choice is up to you.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_014.wav|Tonight I want to explain to you what this defense debate is all about, and why I'm convinced that the budget now before the Congress is necessary, responsible and deserving of your support.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_015.wav|And I want to offer hope for the future.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_016.wav|But first, let me say what the defense debate is not about.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_017.wav|It is not about spending arithmetic.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_018.wav|I know that in the last few weeks you've been bombarded with numbers and percentages, some say we need only a 5% increase in defense spending.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_019.wav|The so-called alternate budget backed by liberals in the House of Representatives were the lower the figure to 2 to 3%.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_020.wav|Cutting our defense spending by $163 billion over the next five years.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_021.wav|The trouble with all these numbers is that they tell us little about the kind of defense program America needs, or the benefits in security and freedom that our defense effort buys for us.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_022.wav|What seems to have been lost in all this debate is the simple truth of how a defense budget is arrived at.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_023.wav|It isn't done by deciding to spend a certain number of dollars.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_024.wav|Those loud voices that are occasionally heard charging that the government is trying to solve a security problem by throwing money at it are nothing more than noise based on ignorance.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_025.wav|We start by considering what must be done to maintain peace and review all the possible threats against our security.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_026.wav|Then a strategy for strengthening peace and defending against those threats must be agreed upon.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_027.wav|And finally, our defense establishment must be evaluated to see what is necessary to protect against any or all of the potential threats.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_028.wav|The cost of achieving these ends is totaled up, and the result is the budget for national defense.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_029.wav|There is no logical way that you can say let's spend $X billion less.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_030.wav|You can only say which part of our defense measures do we believe we can do without and still have security against all contingencies?
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_031.wav|Anyone in the Congress who advocates a percentage or a specific dollar cut in defense spending should be made to say what part of our defense is he would eliminate and he should be candid enough to acknowledge that his cuts mean cutting our commitments to allies or inviting greater risk or both.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_032.wav|The defense policy of the United States is based on a simple premise.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_033.wav|The United States does not start fights.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_034.wav|We will never be an aggressor.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_035.wav|We maintain our strength in order to deter and defend against aggression, to preserve freedom and peace.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_036.wav|Since the dawn of the atomic age we've sought to reduce the risk of war by maintaining a strong deterrent and by seeking genuine arms control.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_037.wav|Deturrence means simply this, making sure any adversary who thinks about attacking the United States or our allies or our vital interests concludes that the risks to him outweigh any potential gains.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_038.wav|Once he understands that he won't attack.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_039.wav|We maintain the peace through our strength.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_040.wav|Weakness only invites aggression.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_041.wav|This strategy of deterrence has not changed.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_042.wav|It still works.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_043.wav|But what it takes to maintain deterrence has changed.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_044.wav|It took one kind of military force to deter an attack when we had far more nuclear weapons than any other power.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_045.wav|It takes another kind now that the Soviets, for example, have enough accurate and powerful nuclear weapons to destroy virtually all of our missiles on the ground.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_046.wav|Now this is not to say that the Soviet Union is planning to make war on us.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_047.wav|Nor do I believe a war is inevitable, quite the contrary.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_048.wav|But what must be recognized is that our security is based on being prepared to meet all threats.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_049.wav|There was a time when we depended on coastal forts and artillery batteries because with the weaponry of that day any attack would have had to come by sea.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_050.wav|Well this is a different world and our defenses must be based on recognition and awareness of the weaponry possessed by other nations in the nuclear age.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_051.wav|We can't afford to believe that we will never be threatened.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_052.wav|There have been two world wars in my lifetime.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_053.wav|We didn't start them and indeed did everything we could to avoid being drawn into them.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_054.wav|But we were ill-prepared for both.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_055.wav|Had we been better prepared, peace might have been preserved.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_056.wav|For 20 years the Soviet Union has been accumulating enormous military night.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_057.wav|They didn't stop when their forces exceeded all requirements of a legitimate defensive capability and they haven't stopped now.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_058.wav|During the past decade and a half the Soviets have built up a massive arsenal of new strategic nuclear weapons, weapons that can strike directly at the United States.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_059.wav|As an example, the United States introduced its last new intercontinental ballistic missile, the Minuteman III in 1969.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_060.wav|And we're now dismantling our even older Titan missiles.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_061.wav|But what has the Soviet Union done in these intervening years?
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_062.wav|Well since 1969 the Soviet Union has built five new classes of ICBMs and upgraded these eight times.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_063.wav|As a result their missiles are much more powerful and accurate than they were several years ago and they continue to develop more while ours are increasingly obsolete.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_064.wav|The same thing has happened in other areas.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_065.wav|Over the same period the Soviet Union built four new classes of submarine-launched ballistic missiles and over 60 new missile submarines.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_066.wav|We built two new types of submarine missiles and actually withdrew 10 submarines from strategic missions.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_067.wav|The Soviet Union built over 200 new backfire bombers and their brand new Blackjack bomber is now under development.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_068.wav|We haven't built a new long-range bomber since our B-52s were deployed about a quarter of a century ago and we've already retired several hundred of those because of old age.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_069.wav|Indeed, despite what many people think, our strategic forces only cost about 15 percent of the defense budget.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_070.wav|Another example of what's happened.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_071.wav|In 1978 the Soviets had 600 intermediate-range nuclear missiles based on land and were beginning to add the SS-20.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_072.wav|A new highly accurate mobile missile with three warheads.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_073.wav|We had none.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_074.wav|Since then the Soviets have strengthened their lead by the end of 1979 when Soviet leader Brezhnev declared a balance now exists.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_075.wav|The Soviets had over 800 warheads.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_076.wav|We still had none.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_077.wav|A year ago this month Mr. Brezhnev pledged a moratorium or freeze on SS-20 deployment, but by last August their 800 warheads had become more than 1200.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_078.wav|We still had none.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_079.wav|Some freeze.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_080.wav|At this time Soviet Defense Minister Yustanov announced approximate parity of forces continues to exist, but the Soviets are still adding an average of three new warheads a week and now have 1,300.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_081.wav|These warheads can reach their targets in a matter of a few minutes.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_082.wav|We still have none.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_083.wav|So far it seems that the Soviet definition of parity is a box score of 1,300 to nothing in their favor.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_084.wav|So together with our NATO allies we decided in 1979 to deploy new weapons beginning this year as a deterrent to their SS-20s and as an incentive to the Soviet Union to meet us in serious arms control negotiations.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_085.wav|We will begin that deployment late this year.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_086.wav|At the same time however we are willing to cancel our program if the Soviets will dismantle theirs.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_087.wav|This is what we call a zero zero plan.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_088.wav|The Soviets are now at the negotiating table and I think it's fair to say that without our planned deployments they wouldn't be there.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_089.wav|Now let's consider conventional forces.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_090.wav|Since 1974 the United States has produced 3,050 tactical combat aircraft.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_091.wav|By contrast the Soviet Union has produced twice as many.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_092.wav|When we look at attack submarines the United States has produced 27 while the Soviet Union has produced 61.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_093.wav|For armored vehicles including tanks we've produced 11,200.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_094.wav|The Soviet Union has produced 54,000 nearly five to one in their favor.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_095.wav|Finally with artillery we've produced 950 artillery and rocket launchers while the Soviets have produced more than 13,000 a staggering 14 to one ratio.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_096.wav|There was a time when we were able to offset superior Soviet numbers with higher quality.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_097.wav|But today they're building weapons as sophisticated and modern as our own.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_098.wav|As the Soviets have increased their military power they've been emboldened to extend that power.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_099.wav|They're spreading their military influence in ways that can directly challenge our vital interests and those of our allies.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_100.wav|The following aerial photographs most of them secret until now.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_101.wav|Illustrate this point in a crucial area very close to home.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_102.wav|Central America and the Caribbean Basin.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_103.wav|They're not dramatic photographs but I think they help give you a better understanding of what I'm talking about.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_104.wav|This Soviet intelligence collection facility less than 100 miles from our coast is the largest of its kind in the world.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_105.wav|The acres and acres of antenna fields and intelligence monitors are targeted on key US military installations and sensitive activities.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_106.wav|The installation in Lord S. Cuba is manned by 1500 Soviet technicians and the satellite ground station allows instant communications with Moscow.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_107.wav|This 28 square mile facility has grown by more than 60 percent in size and capability during the past decade.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_108.wav|In Western Cuba we see this military airfield and its complement of modern Soviet built MiG-23 aircraft.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_109.wav|The Soviet Union uses this Cuban airfield for its own long range reconnaissance missions and earlier this month two modern Soviet anti-submarine warfare aircraft began operating from it.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_110.wav|During the past two years the level of Soviet arms exports to Cuba can only be compared to the levels reached during the Cuban missile crisis 20 years ago.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_111.wav|This third photo which is the only one in this series that has been previously made public shows Soviet military hardware that has made its way to Central America.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_112.wav|This airfield with its Mi-8 helicopters, anti aircraft guns and protected fighter sites is one of a number of military facilities in Nicaragua which has received Soviet equipment funneled through Cuba and reflects the massive military buildup going on in that country.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_113.wav|On the small island of Grenade at the southern end of the Caribbean chain the Cubans with Soviet financing and backing are in the process of building an airfield with a 10,000 foot runway.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_114.wav|Grenade doesn't even have an air force.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_115.wav|Who is it intended for?
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_116.wav|The Caribbean is a very important passageway for our international commerce and military lines of communication.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_117.wav|More than half of all American oil imports now pass through the Caribbean.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_118.wav|The rapid buildup of Grenade's military potential is unrelated to any conceivable threat to this island country of under 110,000 people.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_119.wav|And totally at odds with the pattern of other eastern Caribbean states most of which are unarmed.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_120.wav|The Soviet Cuban militarization of Grenade in short can only be seen as power projection into the region and it is in this important economic and strategic area that we're trying to help the governments of El Salvador, Costa Rica, Honduras and others in their struggles for democracy against guerrillas supported through Cuba and Nicaragua.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_121.wav|These pictures only tell a small part of the story.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_122.wav|I wish I could show you more without compromising our most sensitive intelligence sources and methods.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_123.wav|But the Soviet Union is also supporting Cuban military forces in Angola and Ethiopia.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_124.wav|They have bases in Ethiopia and South Yemen near the Persian Gulf oil fields.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_125.wav|They have taken over the port that we built at Cameran Bay in Vietnam.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_126.wav|And now for the first time in history the Soviet Navy is a force to be reckoned with in the South Pacific.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_127.wav|Some people may still ask, would the Soviets ever use their formidable military power?
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_128.wav|Well again, can we afford to believe they won't?
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_129.wav|There is Afghanistan and in Poland the Soviets denied the will of the people and in so doing demonstrated the world how their military power could also be used to intimidate.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_130.wav|The final fact is that the Soviet Union is acquiring what can only be considered an offensive military force.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_131.wav|They have continued to build far more intercontinental ballistic missiles than they could possibly need simply to deter an attack.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_132.wav|Their conventional forces are trained and equipped not so much to defend against an attack as they are to permit sudden surprise offensive of their own.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_133.wav|Our NATO allies have assumed a great defense burden including the military draft in most countries.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_134.wav|We're working with them and our other friends around the world to do more.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_135.wav|Our defensive strategy means we need military forces that can move very quickly.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_136.wav|Forces that are trained and ready to respond to any emergency.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_137.wav|Every item in our defense program, our ships, our tanks, our planes, our funds for training and spare parts is intended for one all-important purpose to keep the peace.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_138.wav|Unfortunately a decade of neglecting our military forces had called into question our ability to do that.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_139.wav|When I took office in January 1981 I was appalled by what I found.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_140.wav|American planes that couldn't fly and American ships that couldn't sail for lack of spare parts and trained personnel and insufficient fuel and ammunition for essential training.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_141.wav|The inevitable result of all this was poor morale in our armed forces, difficulty in recruiting the brightest young Americans to wear the uniform, and difficulty in convincing our most experienced military personnel to stay on.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_142.wav|There was a real question then about how well we could meet a crisis and it was obvious that we had to begin a major modernization program to ensure we could deter aggression and preserve the peace in the years ahead.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_143.wav|We had to move immediately to improve the basic readiness and staying power of our conventional forces so they could meet and therefore help deter a crisis.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_144.wav|We had to make up for lost years of investment by moving forward with a long-term plan to prepare our forces to counter the military capabilities our adversaries were developing for the future.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_145.wav|I know that all of you want peace and so do I.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_146.wav|I know too that many of you seriously believe that a nuclear freeze would further the cause of peace.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_147.wav|But a freeze now would make us less, not more secure and would raise, not reduce, the risks of war.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_148.wav|It would be largely unverifiable and would seriously undercut our negotiations on arms reduction.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_149.wav|It would reward the Soviets for their massive military build-up while preventing us from modernizing our aging and increasingly vulnerable forces.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_150.wav|With their present margin of superiority, why should they agree to arms reductions knowing that we were prohibited from catching up?
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_151.wav|Believe me, it wasn't pleasant for someone who had come to Washington to determine to reduce government spending.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_152.wav|But we had to move forward with the task of repairing our defenses, or we would lose our ability to deter conflict now and in the future.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_153.wav|We had to demonstrate to any adversary that aggression could not succeed and that the only real solution was substantial, equitable and effectively verifiable arms reduction.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_154.wav|The kind we're working for right now in Geneva.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_155.wav|Thanks to your strong support and bipartisan support from the Congress, we began to turn things around.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_156.wav|Already, we're seeing some very encouraging results.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_157.wav|Quality recruitment and retention are up dramatically.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_158.wav|More high school graduates are choosing military careers and more experienced career personnel are choosing to stay.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_159.wav|Our men and women in uniform at last are getting the tools and training they need to do their job.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_160.wav|Asking around today, especially among our young people, and I think you'll find a whole new attitude towards serving their country.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_161.wav|This reflects more than just better pay, equipment and leadership.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_162.wav|You, the American people, have sent a signal to these young people that it is once again an honor to wear the uniform.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_163.wav|That's not something you measure in a budget, but it's a very real part of our nation's strength.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_164.wav|It'll take us longer to build the kind of equipment we need to keep peace in the future, but we've made a good start.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_165.wav|We haven't built a new long-range bomber for 21 years.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_166.wav|Now we're building the B1.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_167.wav|We hadn't launched one new strategic submarine for 17 years.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_168.wav|Now we're building one Triton submarine a year.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_169.wav|Our land-based missiles are increasingly threatened by the many huge new Soviet ICBMs.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_170.wav|We're determining how to solve that problem.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_171.wav|At the same time, we're working in the start and INF negotiations with a goal of achieving deep reductions in the strategic and intermediate nuclear arsenals of both sides.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_172.wav|We have also begun the long-needed modernization of our conventional forces.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_173.wav|The Army is getting its first new tank in 20 years.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_174.wav|The Air Force is modernizing.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_175.wav|We're rebuilding our Navy, which shrank from about a thousand ships in the late 1960s to 453 during the 1970s.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_176.wav|Our nation needs a superior Navy to support our military forces and vital interests overseas.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_177.wav|We're now on the road to achieving a 600-ship Navy and increasing the amphibious capabilities of our Marines, who are now serving the cause of peace in Lebanon.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_178.wav|And we're building a real capability to assist our friends in the vitally important Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf region.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_179.wav|This adds up to a major effort, and it isn't cheap.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_180.wav|It comes at a time when there are many other pressures on our budget, and when the American people have already had to make major sacrifices during the recession.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_181.wav|But we must not be misled by those who would make defense once again the scapegoat of the federal budget.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_182.wav|The fact is that in the past few decades, we have seen a dramatic shift in how we spend the taxpayers' dollar.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_183.wav|Back in 1955, payments to individuals took up only about 20 percent of the federal budget.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_184.wav|For nearly three decades, these payments steadily increased, and this year will account for 49 percent of the budget.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_185.wav|By contrast, in 1955, defense took up more than half of the federal budget.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_186.wav|By 1980, this spending had fallen to a low of 23 percent.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_187.wav|Even with the increase that I am requesting this year, defense will still amount to only 28 percent of the budget.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_188.wav|The calls for cutting back the defense budget come in nice, simple arithmetic.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_189.wav|They're the same kind of talk that led the democracies to neglect their defenses in the 1930s and invited the tragedy of World War II.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_190.wav|We must not let that grim chapter of history repeat itself through apathy or neglect.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_191.wav|This is why I'm speaking to you tonight.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_192.wav|Doers you to tell your senators and congressmen that you know we must continue to restore our military strength?
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_193.wav|If we stop in midstream, we will send a signal of decline, of lessened will, to friends and adversaries alike.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_194.wav|Free people must voluntarily, through open debate and democratic means, meet the challenge that totalitarians pose by compulsion.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_195.wav|It's up to us, in our time, to choose and choose wisely, between the hard but necessary task of preserving peace and freedom, and the temptation to ignore our duty and blindly hope for the best while the enemies of freedom grow stronger day by day.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_196.wav|The solution is well within our grasp, but to reach it, there is simply no alternative but to continue this year in this budget to provide the resources we need to preserve the peace and guarantee our freedom.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_197.wav|Now, thus far tonight, I've shared with you my thoughts on the problems of national security we must face together.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_198.wav|My predecessors in the Oval Office have appeared before you on other occasions to describe the threat posed by Soviet power and to propose steps to address that threat.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_199.wav|But since the advent of nuclear weapons, those steps have been increasingly directed toward deterrence of aggression through the promise of retaliation.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_200.wav|This approach to stability through offensive threat has worked.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_201.wav|We and our allies have succeeded in preventing nuclear war for more than three decades.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_202.wav|In recent months, however, my advisors, including in particular, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have underscored the necessity to break out of a future that relies solely on offensive retaliation for our security.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_203.wav|Over the course of these discussions, I've become more and more deeply convinced that the human spirit must be capable of rising above dealing with other nations and human beings by threatening their existence.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_204.wav|Feeling this way, I believe we must thoroughly examine every opportunity for reducing tensions and for introducing greater stability and that the strategic calculus on both sides.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_205.wav|One of the most important contributions we can make is, of course, to lower the level of all arms and particularly nuclear arms.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_206.wav|We're engaged right now in several negotiations with the Soviet Union to bring about a mutual reduction of weapons.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_207.wav|I will report to you a week from tomorrow my thoughts on that score.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_208.wav|But let me just say I'm totally committed to this course.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_209.wav|If the Soviet Union will join with us in our effort to achieve major arms reduction, we will have succeeded in stabilizing the nuclear balance.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_210.wav|Nevertheless, it will still be necessary to rely on the specter of retaliation on mutual threat.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_211.wav|And that's a sad commentary on the human condition.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_212.wav|Wouldn't it be better to save lives than to avenge them?
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_213.wav|Are we not capable of demonstrating our peaceful intentions by applying all our abilities and our ingenuity to achieving a truly lasting stability?
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_214.wav|I think we are.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_215.wav|Indeed, we must.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_216.wav|After careful consultation with my advisors, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I believe there is a way.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_217.wav|Let me share with you a vision of the future which offers hope.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_218.wav|It is that we embark on a program to counter the awesome Soviet missile threat with measures that are defensive.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_219.wav|Let us turn to the very strengths in technology that spawned our great industrial base and that have given us the quality of life we enjoy today.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_220.wav|What if free people could live secure in the knowledge that their security did not rest upon the threat of instant US retaliation to deter a Soviet attack that we could intercept and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached our own soil or that of our allies?
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_221.wav|I know this is a formidable technical task, one that may not be accomplished before the end of this century.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_222.wav|Yet current technology has attained a level of sophistication where it's reasonable for us to begin this effort.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_223.wav|It will take years, probably decades of effort on many fronts.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_224.wav|There will be failures and setbacks, just as there will be successes and breakthroughs.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_225.wav|And as we proceed, we must remain constant in preserving the nuclear deterrent and maintaining a solid capability for flexible response.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_226.wav|But isn't it worth every investment necessary to free the world from the threat of nuclear war?
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_227.wav|We know it is.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_228.wav|In the meantime, we will continue to pursue real reductions in nuclear arms negotiating from a position of strength that can be ensured only by modernizing our strategic forces.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_229.wav|At the same time, we must take steps to reduce the risk of a conventional military conflict escalating to nuclear war by improving our non-nuclear capabilities.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_230.wav|America does possess now the technologies to attain very significant improvements in the effectiveness of our conventional non-nuclear forces.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_231.wav|Proceeding boldly with these new technologies, we can significantly reduce any incentive that the Soviet Union may have to threaten attack against the United States or its allies.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_232.wav|As we pursue our goal of defensive technologies, we recognize that our allies rely up on our strategic offensive power to deter attacks against them.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_233.wav|Their vital interests and hours are inextricably linked.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_234.wav|Their safety and hours are won, and no change in technology can or will alter that reality.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_235.wav|We must and shall continue to honor our commitments.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_236.wav|I clearly recognize that defensive systems have limitations and raise certain problems and ambiguities.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_237.wav|If paired with offensive systems, they can be viewed as fostering an aggressive policy, and no one wants that.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_238.wav|But with these considerations firmly in mind, I call upon the scientific community in our country, those who gave us nuclear weapons to turn their great talents now to the cause of mankind and world peace, to give us the means of rendering these nuclear weapons impotent and obsolete.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_239.wav|Tonight, consistent with our obligations under the ABM Treaty and recognizing the need for closer consultation with our allies, I'm taking an important first step.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_240.wav|I am directing a comprehensive and intensive effort to define a long-term research and development program to begin to achieve our ultimate goal of eliminating the threat posed by strategic nuclear missiles.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_241.wav|This could pave the way for arms control measures to eliminate the weapons themselves.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_242.wav|We seek neither military superiority nor political advantage.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_243.wav|Our only purpose, one all people share, is to search for ways to reduce the danger of nuclear war.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_244.wav|I fell to Americans, tonight we're launching an effort which holds the promise of changing the course of human history.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_245.wav|There will be risks and results take time, but I believe we can do it.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_246.wav|As we cross this threshold, I ask for your prayers and your support.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_247.wav|Thank you, good night and God bless you.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_001.wav|uh, in my life's journey over these past eight decades, I have seen the human race through a period of unparalleled tumult and triumph.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_002.wav|I have seen the birth of communism.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_003.wav|I have witnessed a bloody futility of two world wars and Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_004.wav|I have seen Germany united, divided and united again.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_005.wav|I have seen television grow from a power novelty to become the most powerful vehicle of communication in history.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_006.wav|As a boy, I saw streets filled with model teas.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_007.wav|As a man, I have met men who walked on the moon.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_008.wav|I have not only seen but lived the marvels of what historians have called the American century.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_009.wav|There was a time when empires were defined by land mass, subjugated peoples and military might, but the United States is unique because we are an empire of ideals, a free men and free markets and of the extraordinary possibilities that lie within seemingly ordinary men and women.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_010.wav|We believe that no power of government is as formidable a force for good as the creativity and entrepreneurial drive of the American people and a culture envied by people everywhere.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_011.wav|This powerful sense of energy has made American synonymous for opportunity the world over.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_012.wav|And after generations of struggle, America is the moral force that defeated communism.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_013.wav|Within a few short years, we Americans have experienced the most sweeping changes of this century, the fall of the Soviet Union and the rise of the global economy.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_014.wav|No transition is without its problems, but as uncomfortable as it may feel at the moment, the changes of the 1990s will leave America more dynamic and less in danger than at any time in my life.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_015.wav|Once wrote in his diary, many thinking people believe America has seen its best days.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_016.wav|He wrote that July 26, 1775.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_017.wav|There are still those who believe America is weakening that our glory was the brief flash of time called the 20th century, that ours was a burst of greatness too bright and brilliant to sustain, that America's purpose is passed.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_018.wav|My friends, I utterly reject those views.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_019.wav|Who among us would trade America's future for that of any other country in the world?
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_020.wav|And who could possibly have so little faith in our American people that they would trade our tomorrow for our yesterday?
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_021.wav|I'll give you a hint.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_022.wav|They kept telling us with straight face that therefore family values, therefore a strong America, therefore less intrusive government.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_023.wav|We mustn't forget even if they would like to, the very different America that existed just 12 years ago, an America with 21 percent interest rates and back to back years of double digit inflation.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_024.wav|Pagex plunged and motorists sat in gas lines and America whose leaders told us it was our own fault, that ours was a future of scarcity and sacrifice, and that what we really needed was another good dose.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_025.wav|It was a world where aggressive Soviet communism was on the rise, an America strength was in decline.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_026.wav|It was a world where our children came of age under the threat of nuclear holocaust.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_027.wav|It was a world where our leaders told us that standing up to aggressors was dangerous, that America might and determination were somehow obstacles to peace.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_028.wav|But we stood tall and proclaimed that communism was destined for the ash heap of history.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_029.wav|The sky would not fall if America restored her strength and resolved.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_030.wav|The sky would not fall if an American president spoke the truth.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_031.wav|But where they see only problems, I see possibilities as vast and diverse as the American family itself.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_032.wav|Even as we meet the rest of the world is astounded by the pundits and finger pointers who are so down on us as a nation.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_033.wav|What I've said it before and I'll say it again.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_034.wav|America remains what Emerson called her 150 years ago, the country of tomorrow.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_035.wav|What a wonderful description and how true and yet tomorrow might never have happened had we lacked the courage in the 1980s to chart a course of strength and honor.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_036.wav|The stakes are high, the presidency is serious business, we cannot afford to take a chance, we need a man of serious purpose, unmatched experience, knowledge and ability.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_037.wav|A man who understands government, who understands our country and who understands the world.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_038.wav|A man who has been at the table with Gorbachev and Jeltsin, a man whose performance as commander-in-chief of the bravest and most effective fighting force in history left the world in awe and the people of Kuwait.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_039.wav|By his own admission, he is a quiet man and not a shaman.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_040.wav|He is a trustworthy and level-headed leader who is respected around the world.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_041.wav|His is a steady hand on the tiller through the choppy waters of the 90s, which is exactly what we need.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_042.wav|We need George Bush, the Gavill-Wielding Chairman, the bloated staffs, the taxers and takers and congressional rule makers.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_043.wav|We have a simple slogan for November 1992.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_044.wav|For 50 of the last 60 years, the Democrats have controlled the Senate to clean out the privileges and perks, clean out the arrogance and the big egos.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_045.wav|This is the 21st, 21st presidential election in my lifetime, the 16th in which I will cast a ballot.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_046.wav|Each of those elections had its shifting moods of the moment, his headlines of one day that were forgotten the next.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_047.wav|There have been a few more twists and turns this year than in others, a little more shouting about who was up or down in or out as we went about selecting our candidates.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_048.wav|But now we have arrived as we always do at the moment of truth, the serious business of selecting a president.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_049.wav|Now is the time for choosing.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_050.wav|As it did 12 years ago, and as we have seen many times in history, our country now stands at a crossroads.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_051.wav|There is widespread doubt about our public institutions and profound concern not merely about the economy, but about the overall direction of this great country.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_052.wav|And as they did then, the American people are clamoring for change and sweeping reform.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_053.wav|The question we had to ask 12 years ago is the question we ask today.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_054.wav|What kind of change can we Republicans offer the American people?
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_055.wav|Some might believe that the things we've talked about tonight are irrelevant to the choice.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_056.wav|These new isolationists claim that the American people don't care about how or why we prevailed in the great defining struggle of our age, the victory of liberty over our adversaries.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_057.wav|They insist that our triumph is yesterday's news, part of a past that holds no lessons for the future.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_058.wav|Well, nothing could be more tragic after having come all this way on the journey of renewal we began 12 years ago.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_059.wav|Then if America herself forgot the lessons of individual liberty that she has taught to a grateful world, Emerson was right.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_060.wav|We are the country of tomorrow.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_061.wav|Our revolution did not end at more than two centuries later, America remains on a voyage of discovery, a land that has never become but is always in the act of becoming.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_062.wav|But just as we have led the crusade for democracy beyond our shores, we have a great task to do together in our own home.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_063.wav|Now I would appeal to you to invigorate democracy in your own neighborhoods, whether we come from poverty or wealth, whether we are Afro-American or Irish-American, Christian or Jewish, from big cities or small towns, we are all equal in the eyes of God.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_064.wav|Every day brings fresh challenges and opportunities to match.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_065.wav|With each sunrise, we are reminded that millions of our citizens have yet to share in the abundance of American prosperity.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_066.wav|Many languish in neighborhood riddled with drugs and bereft of hope.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_067.wav|Still others hesitate to venture out on the streets for fear of criminal violence.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_068.wav|Let us pledge ourselves to a new beginning for them.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_069.wav|Let us apply our ingenuity and remarkable spirit to revolutionize education in America so that everyone among us will have the mental tools to build a better life.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_070.wav|And while we do so, let us remember that the most profound education begins in the home, into rebuilding our inner cities so that real jobs can be created for those who live there and real hope can rise out of despair.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_071.wav|Let us strengthen our healthcare system so that Americans of all ages can be secure in their futures without the fear of financial ruin.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_072.wav|And my friends, once and for all, renew our pledge to day by day, person by person, make our country in the world a better place to live.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_073.wav|Then, when the nations of the world turn to us and say, America, you are the model of freedom and prosperity.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_074.wav|We can turn to them and say, I want you to know that I have always had the highest respect for you, for your common sense and intelligence, and for your decency.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_075.wav|I have always believed in you and in what you could accomplish for yourselves and for others.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_076.wav|And whatever else history may say about me when I'm gone, I hope it will record that I appeal to your best hopes, not your worst fears, to your confidence rather than your doubts.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_077.wav|My dream is that you will travel the road ahead with liberty's lamp guiding your steps and opportunities arm, steadying your way.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_078.wav|My Hon, fondest hope for each one of you, and especially for the young people here, not for her power or wealth, but for herself, thisness, and idealism.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_079.wav|May each of you have the heart to conceive the understanding to direct and the hand to execute works that will make the world a little better for you having been here.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_080.wav|May all of you as Americans never forget your heroic origins, never fail to seek divine guidance, and never lose your natural God-given optimism.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_081.wav|And finally, I fellow Americans, may every dawn be a great new beginning for America and every evening bring us closer to that shining city upon a hill.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_082.wav|Before I go, I would like to ask the person who has made my life's journey so meaningful, someone I have been so very proud of over the years to join me.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_001.wav|economic recovery program and why I believe it's essential that the congress approve this package, which I believe will lift the crushing burden of inflation off of our citizens and restore the vitality to our economy and our industrial machine.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_002.wav|First however, and due to events of the past few weeks, will you permit me to digress for a moment from the all important subject of why we must bring government spending under control and reduce tax rates?
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_003.wav|I'd like to say a few words directly to all of you and to those who are watching and listening tonight, because it's the only way I know to express to all of you on behalf of Nancy and myself our appreciation for your messages, your flowers, and most of all your prayers.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_004.wav|Not only for me, but for those others who fell beside me, the warmth of your words, the expression of friendship, and yes love, meant more to us than you can ever know.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_005.wav|You have given us a memory that we'll treasure forever.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_006.wav|And you've provided, provided an answer to those few voices that were raised saying that what happened was evidence that ours is a six society.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_007.wav|The society we heard from is made up of millions of compassionate Americans and their children from college age to kindergarten.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_008.wav|As a matter of fact, as evidence of that, I have a letter with me.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_009.wav|Letter came from Peter Swini.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_010.wav|He's in the second grade in the Riverside School in Rockville Center.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_011.wav|And he said,
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_012.wav|I hope you get well quick.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_013.wav|Let's talk about getting spending and inflation under control and cutting your tax rates.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_014.wav|Mr. Speaker and Senator Baker,
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_015.wav|I want to thank you for your cooperation in helping to arrange this joint session of the Congress.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_016.wav|I won't be speaking to you very long tonight, but I ask for this meeting because the urgency of our joint mission has not changed.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_017.wav|Thanks to some very fine people, my health is much improved.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_018.wav|I'd like to be able to say that with regard to the health of the economy, it's been half a year since the election that charged all of us in this government with a task of restoring our economy.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_019.wav|Where have we come in these six months?
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_020.wav|Inflation is measured by the Consumer Price Index has continued at a double digit rate.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_021.wav|Mortgage interest rates have averaged almost 15 percent for these six months, preventing families across America from buying homes.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_022.wav|There are still almost eight million unemployed.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_023.wav|The average workers hourly earnings after adjusting for inflation are lower today than they were six months ago, and there have been over 6,000 business failures.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_024.wav|Six months is long enough.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_025.wav|American people now want us to act and not in half measures.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_026.wav|They demand and they've earned a full and comprehensive effort to clean up our economic mess.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_027.wav|Because of the extent of our economy sickness, we know that the cure will not come quickly, and that even with our package, progress will come in inches and feet, not in miles.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_028.wav|But to fail to act will delay even longer and more painfully the cure which must come, and that cure begins with the federal budget.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_029.wav|And the budgetary actions taken with the Congress over the next few days will determine how we respond to the message of last November 4th.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_030.wav|That message was very simple.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_031.wav|Our government is too big.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_032.wav|You and I have enjoyed a relationship based on extraordinary cooperation.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_033.wav|Because of this cooperation, we've come a long distance in less than three months.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_034.wav|I want to thank the leadership of the Congress for helping in setting a fair timetable for consideration of our recommendations and committee chairman on both sides of the aisle of cold prompt and thorough hearings.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_035.wav|We have also communicated in a spirit of candor, openness and mutual respect.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_036.wav|Tonight, as our decision day nears and as the House of Representatives weighs its alternatives, I wish to address you in that same spirit.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_037.wav|The Senate Budget Committee under the leadership of Pete Domenici has just today voted out budget resolution supported by Democrats and Republicans alike that is in all major respects consistent with the program that we have proposed.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_038.wav|But an equally crucial test involves the House of Representatives.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_039.wav|The House will soon be choosing between two different versions or measures to deal with the economy.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_040.wav|One is the measure offered by the House Budget Committee.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_041.wav|The other is a bipartisan measure, a substitute introduced by Congressman Phil Graham of Texas and Del Lata of Ohio.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_042.wav|On behalf of the administration, let me say that we embrace and fully support reducing the tax burden, building a national defense second and none, and stimulating economic growth and creating millions of new jobs.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_043.wav|At the same time, however, I must state our opposition to the measure offered by the House Budget Committee.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_044.wav|It may appear that we have two alternatives.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_045.wav|In reality, however, there are no more alternatives left.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_046.wav|The committee measure quite simply falls far too short of the essential actions that we must take.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_047.wav|For example, in the next three years, the committee measure projects spending $141 billion more than does the bipartisan substitute.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_048.wav|It regrettably cuts over $14 billion in essential defense spending, funding required to restore America's national security.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_049.wav|It adheres to the failed policy of trying to balance the budget on the taxpayers' back.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_050.wav|It would increase tax payments by over a third, adding up to a staggering quarter of a trillion dollars.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_051.wav|Federal taxes would increase 12 percent each year.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_052.wav|Taxpayers would be paying a larger share of their income to government in 1984 than they do with President.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_053.wav|In short, that measure reflects an echo of the past rather than a benchmark for the future.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_054.wav|High taxes and excess spending growth created our present economic mess.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_055.wav|More of the same will not cure the hardship, anxiety, and discouragement it is imposed on the American people.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_056.wav|Let us cut through the fog for a moment.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_057.wav|The answer to a government that is too big is to stop feeding its growth.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_058.wav|Government spending has been growing faster than the economy itself.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_059.wav|The massive national debt which we accumulated is the result of the government's high spending diet, will it's time to change the diet and to change it in the right way.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_060.wav|Let me make a few points that I feel have been overlooked.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_061.wav|First of all, it should be looked at as an integral part of the entire package.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_062.wav|Not something separate and apart from the budget reductions, the regulatory relief, and the monetary restraints.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_063.wav|Probably the most common misconception is that we are proposing to reduce government revenues to less than what the government has been receiving.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_064.wav|This is not true.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_065.wav|Actually, the discussion has to do with how much of a tax increase should be imposed on the taxpayer in 1982.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_066.wav|I know that over the recess in some informal polling, some of your constituents have been asked which they'd rather have, a balanced budget or a tax cut.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_067.wav|And with a common sense that characterizes the people of this country, the answer, of course, has been a balanced budget.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_068.wav|But may I suggest, with no inference that there was wrong intent in the part of those who asked the question, the question was inappropriate to the situation.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_069.wav|Our choice is not between a balanced budget and a tax cut.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_070.wav|Properly asked, the question is, do you want a great big raise in your taxes this coming year, or at the worst, a very little increase, with the prospect of tax reduction and a balanced budget down the roadaways?
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_071.wav|With a common sense that the people have already shown, I'm sure we all know what the answer to that question would be.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_072.wav|A gigantic tax increase has been built into the system.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_073.wav|We propose nothing more than a reduction of that increase.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_074.wav|The people have a right to know that even with our plan, they will be paying more in taxes, but not as much more as they will without it.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_075.wav|Should I believe, offered by the House Budget Committee, will leave spending too high and tax rates too high.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_076.wav|At the same time, I think it cuts the defense budget too much, and by attempting to reduce the deficit through higher taxes, it will not create the kind of strong economic growth and the new jobs that we must have.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_077.wav|Let us not overlook the fact that the small, independent businessmen or women creates more than 80 percent of all the new jobs and employees more than half of our total workforce.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_078.wav|Our across the board cut in tax rates for a three year period will give them much of the incentive and promise of stability they need to go forward with expansion plans calling for additional employees.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_079.wav|Tonight, I renew my call for us to work as a team to join in cooperation so that we find answers which will begin to solve all our economic problems and not just some of them.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_080.wav|The economic recovery package that I have outlined a year over the past few weeks is, I deeply believe, the only answer that we have left.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_081.wav|Reducing the growth of spending, cutting marginal tax rates, providing relief from over-regulation, and following an on-inflationary and predictable monetary policy, our interwoven measures, which will ensure that we have addressed each of the severe dislocations which threaten our economic future.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_082.wav|These policies will make our economy stronger, and the stronger economy will balance the budget which we are committed to do by 1984.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_083.wav|I pledge loyalty to only one special interest group.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_084.wav|We, the people, those people, neighbors and friends, shopkeepers and laborers, farmers and craftsmen do not have infinite patience.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_085.wav|As a matter of fact, some 80 years ago, Teddy Roosevelt wrote these instructive words in his first message to the Congress.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_086.wav|The American people are slowed her wrath, but when their wrath is once kindled, it burns like a consuming flame.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_087.wav|Well, perhaps that kind of wrath will be deserved if our answer to these serious problems is to repeat the mistakes of the past.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_088.wav|The old and comfortable way is to shave a little here and add a little there.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_089.wav|Well, that's not acceptable anymore.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_090.wav|I think this great and historic Congress knows that way is no longer acceptable.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_091.wav|Here in these chambers, a little earlier, I told you that I wanted this program for economic recovery to be ours, yours and mine.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_092.wav|I think the bipartisan substitute bill has achieved that purpose.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_093.wav|It moves us toward economic vitality.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_094.wav|Just two weeks ago, you and I joined millions of our fellow Americans in marveling at the magic historical moment, a John Young and Bob Crippin created in their space shuttle Columbia.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_095.wav|The last man-defert was almost six years ago, and I remembered on this more recent day over the years, how it all come to expect technological precision of our men and machines.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_096.wav|And each amazing achievement became commonplace until the next new challenge was raised.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_097.wav|With a space shuttle, we tested our ingenuity once again, moving beyond the accomplishments of the past into the promise and uncertainty of the future.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_098.wav|Thus, we not only planned to send up a 122 foot aircraft, 170 miles into space, but we also intended to make it maneuverable and return it to Earth, landing 98 tons of exotic metals delicately on a remote dry lake bed.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_099.wav|The space shuttle did more than prove our technological abilities.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_100.wav|It raised our expectations once more.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_101.wav|It started as dreaming again.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_102.wav|The poet Carl Sandberg wrote, the Republic is a dream.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_103.wav|Nothing happens unless first a dream.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_104.wav|And that's what makes us as Americans different.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_105.wav|We've always reached for a new spirit and aimed at a higher goal.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_106.wav|We've been courageous and determined, unafraid and bold.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_107.wav|Who among us wants to be first to say we no longer have those qualities, that we must limp along, doing the same things that have brought us our present misery.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_108.wav|I believe that the people you and I represent are ready to chart a new course.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_109.wav|They look to us to meet the great challenge, to reach beyond the commonplace and not fall short for lack of creativity or courage.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_110.wav|Someone you know has said that he who would have nothing to do with thorns must never attempt to gather flowers.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_111.wav|But we have much greatness before us.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_112.wav|We can restore our economic strength and build opportunities like none we've ever had before.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_113.wav|As Carl Sandberg said, all we need to begin with is a dream that we can do better than before.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_114.wav|All we need to have is faith and that dream will come true.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_115.wav|All we need to do is act and the time for action is now.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_001.wav|our assumptions about government and its place in our lives.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_002.wav|Out of that change has come great and robust growth in our confidence, our economy and our role in the world.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_003.wav|Tonight America is stronger because of the values that we hold dear.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_004.wav|We believe faith and freedom must be our guiding stars for they show us truth and make us brave, give us hope and leave us wiser than we were.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_005.wav|Our progress began not in Washington DC, but in the hearts of our families, communities, workplaces and voluntary groups which together are unleashing the invincible spirit of one great nation under God.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_006.wav|And a great industrial giant is reborn.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_007.wav|Tonight we can take pride in 25 straight months of economic growth, the strongest in 34 years, a three year inflation average of 3.9 percent, the lowest in 17 years and 7.3 million new jobs in two years with more of our citizens working planted the rich seeds for future success.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_008.wav|For an America of wisdom that honors the family, knowing that as the family goes, so goes our civilization.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_009.wav|For an America of vision that sees tomorrow's dreams and the learning and hard work of we do today, for an America of courage, whose service men and women even as we meet proudly stand watch on the frontiers of freedom.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_010.wav|For an America of compassion that opens its heart to those who cry out for help.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_011.wav|We have begun well, but it's only a beginning.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_012.wav|We're not here to congratulate ourselves on what we have done, but to challenge ourselves to finish what has not yet been done.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_013.wav|Millions in our inner cities who long for real jobs, safe neighborhoods and schools that truly teach.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_014.wav|We're here to speak for the American farmer, the entrepreneur, and every worker in industries fighting a modernized and compete.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_015.wav|And yes, we're here to stand and proudly so, for all who struggle to break free from totalitarianism, for all who know in their hearts that freedom is the one true path to peace and human happiness.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_016.wav|Proverbs tell us that without a vision, the people perish.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_017.wav|When asked what great principle holds our union together, Abraham Lincoln said something in the declaration giving liberty not alone to the people of this country, but hope to the world for all future time.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_018.wav|We honor the giants of our history not by going back, but forward to the dreams their vision foresaw.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_019.wav|My fellow citizens, this nation is poised for greatness.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_020.wav|The time has come to proceed toward a great new challenge, a second American revolution of hope and opportunity.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_021.wav|A revolution carrying us to new heights of progress by pushing back frontiers of knowledge and space.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_022.wav|The revolution of spirit that taps the soul of America, enabling us to summon greater strength than we've ever known.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_023.wav|And a revolution that carries beyond our shores, the golden promise of human freedom in a world at peace.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_024.wav|There are no constraints on the human mind, no walls around the human spirit, no barriers to our progress, except those we are ourselves erect.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_025.wav|Already pushing down tax rates has freed our economy to vault forward to record growth.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_026.wav|In Europe, they're calling it the American miracle.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_027.wav|Day by day, we are shattering accepted notions of what is possible.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_028.wav|When I was growing up, we failed to see how a new thing called radio would transform our marketplace.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_029.wav|Well, today, many have not yet seen how advances in technology are transforming our lives.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_030.wav|In the late 1950s, workers at the AT&T Concemic Conductor Plant in Pennsylvania produced five transistors a day for $7.5 a piece.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_031.wav|They now produce over a million for less than a penny a piece.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_032.wav|New laser techniques could revolutionize heart bypass surgery, cut diagnosis time for viruses linked to cancer from weeks to minutes, reduce hospital costs dramatically, and hold out new promise for saving human lives.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_033.wav|Our automobile industry is overhauled assembly lines, increased worker productivity, and is competitive once again.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_034.wav|We stand on the threshold of a great ability to produce more, do more, be more.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_035.wav|Our economy is not getting older and weaker.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_036.wav|It's getting younger and stronger.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_037.wav|It needs new challenge, greater freedom, and that word freedom is the key to the second American revolution that we mean to bring about.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_038.wav|Let us move together with an historic reform of tax simplification for fairness and growth.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_039.wav|Last year, I asked Treasury Secretary then, Reagan, to develop a plan to simplify the tax code so all taxpayers would be treated more fairly and personal tax rates could come further down.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_040.wav|We have cut tax rates by almost 25%.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_041.wav|Yet the tax system remains unfair and limits our potential for growth.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_042.wav|Exclusions and exemptions cause similar incomes to be taxed at different levels.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_043.wav|Low income families face steep tax barriers that make hard lives even harder.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_044.wav|The Treasury Department has produced an excellent reform plan whose principles will guide the final proposal that we will ask you to enact.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_045.wav|One thing that tax reform will not be is a tax increase in disguise.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_046.wav|We will reduce personal tax rates as low as possible by removing many tax preferences.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_047.wav|We will propose a top rate of no more than 35% and possibly lower.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_048.wav|And we will propose reducing corporate rates while maintaining incentives for capital formation.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_049.wav|To encourage opportunity and jobs rather than dependency and welfare, we will propose that individuals living at or near the poverty line be totally exempt, the personal exemption.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_050.wav|And tonight, I am instructing Treasury Secretary James Baker,
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_051.wav|I have to get used to saying that, to begin working with congressional authors and committees for bipartisan legislation conforming to these principles.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_052.wav|We will call upon the American people for support and upon every man and woman in this chamber.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_053.wav|Together, we can pass this year a tax bill for fairness, simplicity, and growth, making this economy the engine of our dreams, and America the investment capital of the world toward unleashing the tremendous pent-up power of our economy.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_054.wav|But a second American revolution must carry the promise of opportunity for all.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_055.wav|It is time to liberate the spirit of enterprise in the most distressed areas of our country.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_056.wav|This government will meet its responsibility to help those in need, but policies that increase dependency break up families and destroy self-respect are not progressive their reactionary.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_057.wav|Despite our strides and civil rights, blacks, Hispanics, and all minorities will not have full and equal power until they have full economic power, passage of enterprise zones to help those in the abandoned corners of our land find jobs, learn skills, and build better lives.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_058.wav|This legislation is supported by a majority of you.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_059.wav|The Mr. Speaker,
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_060.wav|I know we agree that there must be no forgotten Americans.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_061.wav|Let us place new dreams in a million hearts and create a new generation of entrepreneurs by passing enterprise zones this year.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_062.wav|Pass our youth employment opportunity wage proposal.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_063.wav|We can help teenagers who have the highest unemployment rate find summer jobs so they can know the pride of work and have confidence in their futures.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_064.wav|We will continue to support the job training partnership act, which has a nearly two-thirds job placement rate.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_065.wav|Credits in education and healthcare vouchers will help working families shop for services that they need.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_066.wav|Our administration is already encouraging certain low-income public housing residents to own and manage their own dwellings.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_067.wav|It's time that all public housing residents have that opportunity of ownership.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_068.wav|But states and localities, many of which enjoy surpluses from the recovery, must not permit their tax and regulatory policies to stand as barriers to growth.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_069.wav|Let us resolve that we will stop spreading dependency and start spreading opportunity, that we will stop spreading bondage and start spreading freedom.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_070.wav|There are some who say that growth initiatives must await final action on deficit reductions.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_071.wav|For the best way to reduce deficits is through economic growth.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_072.wav|More jobs created and more people will be on payrolls paying taxes.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_073.wav|The best way to reduce government spending is to reduce the need for spending by increasing prosperity.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_074.wav|Each added percentage point per year of real GNP growth will lead to cumulative reduction in deficits of nearly $200 billion over five years.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_075.wav|To move steadily toward a balanced budget, we must also lighten government's claim on our total economy.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_076.wav|We will not do this by raising taxes.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_077.wav|We must make sure that our economy grows faster than the growth in spending by the federal government.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_078.wav|In our fiscal year 1986 budget, overall government program spending will be frozen at the current level.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_079.wav|It must not be one dime higher than fiscal year 1985, and three points are key.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_080.wav|First, the social safety net for the elderly, the needy, the disabled and unemployed will be left intact.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_081.wav|Growth of our major health care programs, Medicare and Medicaid will be slow, but protections for the elderly and needy will be preserved.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_082.wav|Second, we must not relax our efforts to restore military strength just as we near our goal of a fully equipped trained and ready professional core.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_083.wav|National security is government's first responsibility.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_084.wav|So in past years, defense spending took about half the federal budget.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_085.wav|Today it takes less than a third.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_086.wav|We've already reduced our planned defense expenditures by nearly $100 billion over the past four years and reduced projected spending again this year.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_087.wav|You know, we only have a military industrial complex until a time of danger, and then it becomes the arsenal of democracy.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_088.wav|Peace and freedom.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_089.wav|Third, we must reduce or eliminate costly government subsidies.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_090.wav|For example, deregulation of the airline industry has led to cheaper airfares, but on Amtrak, taxpayers pay about $35 per passenger every time an Amtrak train leaves the station.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_091.wav|It's time we ended this huge federal subsidy.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_092.wav|Yet I know from visiting farmers, many and great financial distress, that we need an orderly transition to a market-oriented farm economy.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_093.wav|We can help farmers best, not by expanding federal payments, but by making fundamental reforms, keeping interest rates heading down.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_094.wav|We are moving ahead with grace commission reforms to eliminate waste and improve government's management practices.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_095.wav|In the long run, we must protect the taxpayers from government.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_096.wav|And I ask again that you pass as 32 states have now called for, an amendment mandating the federal government spend no more than it takes in.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_097.wav|To veto individual items in appropriation bills, Senator Mattingley has introduced a bill permitting a two-year trial run of the line item veto.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_098.wav|I hope you'll pass and send that legislation to my desk, as brought us to a time of reckoning.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_099.wav|Hours is but a moment in history, but one moment of courage, idealism, and bipartisan unity can change American history forever.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_100.wav|Sound monetary policy is key to long-running economic strength and stability.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_101.wav|We will continue to cooperate with the Federal Reserve Board, seeking a steady policy that ensures price stability without keeping interest rates artificially high or needlessly holding down growth.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_102.wav|Reducing unneeded red tape and regulations and deregulating the energy, transportation and financial industries have unleashed new competition, giving consumers more choices, better services, and lower prices.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_103.wav|In just one set of grant programs, we have reduced 905 pages of regulations to 31.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_104.wav|We seek to fully deregulate natural gas to bring on new supplies and bring us closer to energy independence.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_105.wav|Consistent with safety standards, we will continue removing restraints on the bus and railroad industries.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_106.wav|We will soon end up legislation or send up legislation I should say to return Conrail to the private sector where it belongs, and we will support further deregulation of the trucking industry.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_107.wav|Every dollar the federal government does not take from us.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_108.wav|Every decision it does not make for us will make our economy stronger, our lives more abundant, our future more free.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_109.wav|We'll push on to new possibilities not only on Earth, but in the next frontier of space.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_110.wav|Despite budget restraints, we will seek record funding for research and development.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_111.wav|We've seen the success of the space shuttle.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_112.wav|Now we're going to develop a permanently manned space station and new opportunities for free enterprise, because in the next decade Americans and our friends around the world will be living and working together in space.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_113.wav|In the zero gravity of space, we could manufacture in 30 days life-saving medicines it would take 30 years to make on Earth.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_114.wav|We can make crystals of exceptional purity to produce supercomputers, creating jobs, technologies, and medical breakthroughs beyond anything we ever dreamed possible.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_115.wav|As we do, all this will continue to protect our natural resources.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_116.wav|We will seek reauthorization and expanded funding for the Superfund program to continue cleaning hazardous waste sites which threaten human health and the environment, heritage to speak of this evening.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_117.wav|Of all the changes that have swept America the past four years, none brings greater promise than our rediscovery of the values of faith, freedom, family, work, and neighborhood.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_118.wav|We see signs of renewal in increased attendance in places of worship, renewed optimism and faith in our future.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_119.wav|Love of country rediscovered by our young who are leading the way.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_120.wav|We've rediscovered that work is good in and of itself, that it enables us to create and contribute, no matter how seemingly humble our jobs.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_121.wav|We've seen a powerful new current from an old and honorable tradition, American generosity, from thousands answering Peace Corps appeals to help boost food production in Africa.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_122.wav|To millions volunteering time, corporations adopting schools and communities putting together to help the neediest among us at home.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_123.wav|We have re-found our values.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_124.wav|Private sector initiatives are crucial to our future.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_125.wav|I thank the Congress for passing equal access legislation giving religious groups the same right to use classrooms after school that other groups enjoy.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_126.wav|But no citizen need tremble, no the world's shutter.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_127.wav|If a child stands in a classroom and breathes a prayer, we ask you again, give children back a right they had for a century and a half or more in this country.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_128.wav|Abortion is either the taking of a human life or it isn't.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_129.wav|And if it is, and medical technology is increasingly showing it is, it must be stopped.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_130.wav|It is terrible irony that while some turn to abortion so many others who cannot become parents cry out for children to adopt.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_131.wav|We have room for these children.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_132.wav|We can fill the cradles of those who want a child to love.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_133.wav|And tonight I ask you in the Congress to move this year on legislation to protect.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_134.wav|We're returning to excellence and again the heroes are our people not government.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_135.wav|We're stressing basics of discipline, rigorous testing and homework while helping children become computer smart as well.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_136.wav|For 20 years, scholastic aptitude test scores of our high school students went down.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_137.wav|But now they have gone up two of the last three years.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_138.wav|We must go forward in our commitment to the new basics, giving parents greater authority and making sure good teachers are rewarded for hard work and achievement through merit pay.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_139.wav|None has more threatened our sense of national well-being than the explosion of violent crime.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_140.wav|One does not have to be attacked to be a victim.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_141.wav|The woman who has run to her car after shopping at night is a victim.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_142.wav|The couple draping their door with locks and chains are victims.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_143.wav|As is the tired, decent, cleaning woman who can't ride a subway home without being afraid.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_144.wav|We do not seek to violate the rights of defendants.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_145.wav|But we've convicted over 7,400 drago offenders and put them as well as leaders of organized crime behind bars in record numbers.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_146.wav|But we must do more.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_147.wav|I urge the House to follow the Senate and enact proposals permitting use of all reliable evidence that police officers acquire in good faith.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_148.wav|These proposals would also reform the habeas corpus laws and allow in keeping with the will of the overwhelming majority of Americans the use of the death penalty where necessary.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_149.wav|It's time we restored domestic tranquility and we mean to do just that.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_150.wav|Just as we're positioned as never before to secure justice in our economy, we're poised as never before to create a safer, freer, more peaceful world.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_151.wav|Our alliances are stronger than ever.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_152.wav|Our economy is stronger than ever.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_153.wav|We have resumed our historic role as a leader of the free world and all of these together are a great force for peace.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_154.wav|Since 1981, we've been committed to seeking fair and verifiable arms agreements that would lower the risk of war and reduce the size of nuclear arsenals.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_155.wav|Now our determination to maintain a strong defense has influenced the Soviet Union to return to the bargaining table.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_156.wav|Our negotiators must be able to go to that table with the united support of the American people.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_157.wav|All of us have no greater dream than to see the day when nuclear weapons are banned from this earth in modernizing our defenses thus supporting our chances for a meaningful arms agreement.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_158.wav|Your vote this spring on the peacekeeper missile will be a critical test of our resolve to maintain the strength we move need and move toward mutual and verifiable arms reductions.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_159.wav|For the past 20 years, we've believed that no war will be launched as long as each side knows it can retaliate with a deadly counter strike.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_160.wav|Well, I believe there's a better way of eliminating the threat of nuclear war.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_161.wav|It is a strategic defense initiative aimed ultimately at finding a non-nuclear defense against ballistic missiles.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_162.wav|It's the most hopeful possibility of the nuclear age, but it's not very well understood.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_163.wav|Some say it will bring war to the heavens, but its purpose is to deter war in the heavens and on earth.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_164.wav|Now some say the research would be expensive, perhaps, but it could save millions of lives, indeed humanity itself.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_165.wav|Some say if we build such a system, the Soviets will build a defense system of their own.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_166.wav|Well, they already have strategic defenses that surpass ours, a civil defense system where we have almost none, and a research program covering roughly the same areas of technology that we're now exploring.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_167.wav|And finally, some say the research will take a long time.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_168.wav|Well, the answer to that is our security and the world's hopes for peace and human progress lie not in measures of defense or in the control of weapons, but in the growth and expansion of freedom and self-government.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_169.wav|And tonight, we declare a new to our fellow citizens of the world.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_170.wav|Freedom is not the sole prerogative of a chosen few.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_171.wav|It is the universal right of all God's children.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_172.wav|Look to where peace and prosperity flourish today.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_173.wav|It is in homes that freedom built.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_174.wav|Victories against poverty are greatest and peace most secure, where people live by laws that ensure free press, free speech, and freedom to worship, vote, and create wealth.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_175.wav|Our mission is to nourish and defend freedom and democracy, and to communicate these ideals everywhere we can.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_176.wav|America's economic success is freedom's success.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_177.wav|It can be repeated a hundred times in a hundred different nations.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_178.wav|Many countries in East Asia and the Pacific have few resources other than the enterprise of their own people.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_179.wav|But through low tax rates and free markets, they've soared ahead of centralized economies.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_180.wav|And now China is opening up its economy to meet its needs.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_181.wav|We need a stronger and simpler approach to the process of making and implementing trade policy, and we'll be studying potential changes in that process in the next few weeks.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_182.wav|We've seen the benefits of free trade and lived through the disasters of protectionism.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_183.wav|Tonight, I ask all our trading partners developed and developing alike to join us in a new round of trade negotiations, to expand trade and competition and strengthen the global economy and to begin it in this next year.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_184.wav|Human beings living in third world countries with an average per capita income of $650 a year.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_185.wav|Many are victims of dictatorships that impoverish them with taxation and corruption.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_186.wav|Let us ask our allies to join us in a practical program of trade and assistance that fosters economic development through personal incentives to help these people climb from poverty on their own.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_187.wav|We cannot play innocence abroad in a world that's not innocent.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_188.wav|Now, can we be passive when freedom is under siege?
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_189.wav|Without resources diplomacy cannot succeed.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_190.wav|Our security assistance programs help friendly governments defend themselves and give them confidence to work for peace.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_191.wav|And I hope that you in the Congress will understand the dollar for dollar security assistance contributes as much to global security as our own defense budget.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_192.wav|We must stand by all our Democratic allies and we must not break faith with those who are risking their lives on every continent from Afghanistan to Nicaragua to defy Soviet supported aggression and secure rights which have been ours from birth.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_193.wav|With full Cuban, Soviet block support not only persecutes its people, the church and denies a free press, but arms and provides bases for communist terrorists attacking neighboring states.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_194.wav|Support for freedom fighters is self-defense and totally consistent with the OAS and UN charters.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_195.wav|It is essential that the Congress continue all facets of our assistance to Central America to support the Democratic forces who struggle is tied to our own security.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_196.wav|Tonight I have spoken of great plans and great dreams.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_197.wav|Their dreams we can make come true.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_198.wav|Two hundred years of American history should have taught us that nothing is impossible.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_199.wav|Ten years ago, a young girl left Vietnam with her family.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_200.wav|Part of the exodus that followed the fall of Saigon.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_201.wav|They came to the United States with no possessions and not knowing a word of English.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_202.wav|Ten years ago, the young girl studied hard, learned English and finished high school in the top of her class.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_203.wav|And this May, May 22nd to be exact, is a big date on her calendar.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_204.wav|Just ten years from the time she left Vietnam, she will graduate from the United States Military Academy at West Point.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_205.wav|I thought you might like to meet an American hero named Jean Quing.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_206.wav|Now, there's someone else here tonight.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_207.wav|Born 79 years ago, she lives in the inner city where she cares for infants, born of mothers who are heroin addicts.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_208.wav|The children born in withdrawal are sometimes even dropped on her doorstep.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_209.wav|She helps them with love.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_210.wav|Go to her house some night and maybe you'll see her silhouette against the window as she walks the floor, talking softly, soothing a child in her arms.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_211.wav|Mother Hale, your lives tell us that the oldest American saying is new again.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_212.wav|Anything is possible in America if we have the faith, the will, and the heart.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_213.wav|History is asking us once again to be a force for good in the world.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_214.wav|Let us begin in unity with justice and love.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_215.wav|Thank you.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_001.wav|I fell in Americans, there's an old saying we've all heard a thousand times about the weather and how everyone talks about it, but no one does anything about it.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_002.wav|Well, many of you must be feeling that way about the present state of our economy.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_003.wav|Certainly, there's a lot of talk about it, but I want you to know, we're doing something about it, and the reason I wanted to talk to you is because you can help us do something about it.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_004.wav|Believe me, if some of you are confused, I can understand why.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_005.wav|For some time ever since we started planning the 1983 budget for the fiscal year beginning this coming October 1st, there's been a steady drumbeat of quote unquote reports on what we're supposed to be doing.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_006.wav|I know you've read and heard on the news a variety of statements attributed to various quote authoritative government sources who prefer not to have their names used unquote.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_007.wav|Well, you know my name, and I think I'm an authoritative source on this since I'm right in the middle of what's going on here.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_008.wav|So I'd like to set the record straight on a few of the things that you might have heard lately.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_009.wav|I'm sure you've heard that we're proposing the largest single tax increase in history.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_010.wav|The truth is we're proposing nothing of the kind.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_011.wav|And then there's the one that our economic recovery program has failed, so I've abandoned it and turned to increasing taxes instead of trying to reduce federal spending unquote.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_012.wav|Well, don't you believe that one either?
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_013.wav|Yes, there is a tax bill before the Congress tied to a program of further cuts in spending.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_014.wav|It is not, however, the greatest single tax increase in history.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_015.wav|Possibly it could be called the greatest tax reform in history, but it absolutely does not represent any reversal of policy or philosophy on the part of this administration or this president.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_016.wav|Now you may have heard that some special interest opposed this bill, and that's right.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_017.wav|Some do.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_018.wav|As a matter of fact, some in the Congress of my own party objected this bill, and strongly, I'm told by many that this bill is not politically popular and it may not be.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_019.wav|Why then do I support it?
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_020.wav|I supported because it's right for America.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_021.wav|I supported because it's fair.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_022.wav|I supported because it will when combined with our cuts in government spending, reduce interest rates, and put more Americans back to work again.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_023.wav|Now you'll recall that when our administration came into office a year ago last January, we announced a plan for economic recovery.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_024.wav|Recovery from what?
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_025.wav|From a 1980 recession that saw inflation in double-digit figures for the second year in a row, it was 12.4% when we arrived.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_026.wav|Interest rates had gone into outer space.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_027.wav|They were at the highest they'd been in 100 years with a prime rate that hit 21.5%.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_028.wav|There were almost 8 million Americans out of work, and in several hard-hit industrial states, there already were pockets of unemployment reaching figures of 15, 18, and even 20%.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_029.wav|I went to those areas.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_030.wav|I know.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_031.wav|The cost of government was increasing at a rate of 17% a year.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_032.wav|There was little we could do about the budget already in place, but we could do something about the one that had been proposed for the fiscal year beginning in October of our first year.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_033.wav|I had campaigned on the belief that government costs should be reduced, and that the percentage of the people's earnings taken by government in Texas should also be reduced.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_034.wav|I also said that one area of government spending could not be reduced, but must instead be increased.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_035.wav|That was the spending necessary to restore our nation's defenses, which had been allowed to deteriorate to a dangerous degree in the preceding four years.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_036.wav|Interest rates continued high, as the months went by, an unemployment increase, particularly in the automobile industry, and housing construction.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_037.wav|Few could or would afford the high interest rates for home mortgages, or installment buying of an automobile.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_038.wav|Meantime, we were putting our economic recovery program in place.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_039.wav|It wasn't easy.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_040.wav|We didn't get all the cuts we wanted, and we got some tax measures.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_041.wav|We didn't want, but we were charting a complete turnaround in government policy, and we did get the major part of what we proposed.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_042.wav|The Congress mandated spending cuts of $130 billion over three years, and adopted the biggest tax cut in history.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_043.wav|Now, this too was to be implemented over a three-year period.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_044.wav|It began with a 5% cut in the personal income tax beginning October 1, 1981.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_045.wav|Then a 10% cut this last July, and another scheduled for July 1, 1983.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_046.wav|These will be followed by indexing of the tax brackets, so workers getting cost of living pay raises won't be moved up into higher brackets.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_047.wav|We have to realize inflation itself is a tax, government profits by inflation, but indexing will put a stop to that.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_048.wav|There were tax cuts for business and industry to help provide capital for modernization of plant and equipment, changes in the estate tax, capital gains tax, and the marriage penalty tax.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_049.wav|Some who supported us on the spending cuts were fearful about cutting taxes in view of the continuing budget deficits.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_050.wav|We felt the tax cuts had to be a part of our plan in order to provide incentive for individuals and for business to increase productivity and thus create jobs for the unemployed.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_051.wav|Now, it's only been 10 months since the first phase of our program went into effect.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_052.wav|As I said earlier, there are those who say it's been tried and it failed.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_053.wav|Well, as Al Smith used to say, let's look at the record.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_054.wav|Start with interest rates, the basic cause of the present recession.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_055.wav|The prime rate was, as I said, 21.5%.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_056.wav|Well, last week it was 14.5%, and as of today, three major banks have lowered it to 14%.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_057.wav|Last week, 98 Treasury bills were paying less than 9% interest.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_058.wav|One year ago, they were paying 15.5%.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_059.wav|That double-digit inflation, 12.4%, has been cut in half for the last six months.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_060.wav|Real earnings are at last increasing for the first time in quite a long time.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_061.wav|Personal savings, which trended downwards throughout the last decade, are increasing.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_062.wav|This means more money in the pool of investment capital.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_063.wav|This will help further reduce interest rates.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_064.wav|All of this, in only 10 months, hardly looks like a program that failed to me.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_065.wav|Oh, yes, I failed to mention that in the quarter just ended, there was an increase in economic growth.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_066.wav|The first such increase in a long time.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_067.wav|Our biggest problem, the last one to be solved in every recession, is unemployment.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_068.wav|I understand how tough it is for those who are waiting for the jobs that come with recovery.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_069.wav|We can have no rest until our neighbors, our fellow citizens who want to work, are able once again to find jobs.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_070.wav|Again, let me say, the main obstacle to their doing so is continued high interest rates.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_071.wav|Those rates should be lower now than they are with the success we've had in reducing inflation.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_072.wav|But part of the problem is psychological.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_073.wav|A pessimism in the money markets that we won't stay the course and continue lowering the cost of government.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_074.wav|The projected increase in budget deficits has added to that pessimism and fear.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_075.wav|And this brings us back to that so-called greatest tax increase in history and the budget proposals now before the Congress.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_076.wav|When I submitted the 1983 budget to the Congress in February, it contained very significant spending cuts on top of those we obtained last year.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_077.wav|This time, however, we couldn't get the support we had last year.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_078.wav|Some who had not been happy about the tax cuts then were now insisting we must have additional tax revenues.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_079.wav|In fact, they wanted to cancel the reduction scheduled for next July and cancel the indexing of tax brackets.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_080.wav|Others proposed tax increases, mounting to about $150 billion over a three-year period.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_081.wav|On top of this, there was resistance to the spending reductions we asked for and even attempts to eliminate some of last year's cuts so as to actually increase spending.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_082.wav|For many months now, we've been working to get a compromised budget that would further reduce spending and thus reduce the deficits.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_083.wav|We also have stood firm on retaining the tax cuts already in place because, as I said, they are essential to restoring the economy.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_084.wav|We did, however, agree to limited revenue increases so long as they didn't harm the incentive features of our economic recovery program.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_085.wav|We ourselves last year had called attention to the possibility of better compliance with the tax laws, collecting taxes legitimately owed but which were not being paid.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_086.wav|Well, weeks and weeks of negotiations resulted in a congressional budget resolution combining revenue increases and further spending reductions.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_087.wav|Revenues would increase over a three-year period by about $99 billion and outlays in that same period would be reduced by $280 billion.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_088.wav|Now, as you can see, that figures out to about a three-to-one ratio.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_089.wav|$3 less in spending outlays for each $1 of increased revenue.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_090.wav|This compromise adds up to a total over three years of a $380 billion reduction in the budget deficits.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_091.wav|And remember, our original tax reduction remains in place which means your taxes will still be cut $335 billion in these next three years even with the passage of this present tax bill.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_092.wav|Now, let me take that $99 billion tax program apart and you decide whether it's the biggest tax increase in history.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_093.wav|Of the entire $99 billion, $32 billion is collection of tax presently owed under the present laws and which is not being paid.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_094.wav|Not all of you who are paying your tax, simple fairness says we should collect from those who are free loading.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_095.wav|Roughly $48 billion of the $99 billion represents closing off special interest loopholes which have resulted in unintended tax advantages for some, not all, taxpayers.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_096.wav|Some who are financially well able to pay their share.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_097.wav|Now, this is also a matter of simple fairness.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_098.wav|So, more than 80 percent of the tax bill is not new tax at all, but is better collecting and correcting of flaws in the system.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_099.wav|Now, this leaves $19 billion over three years of actual new taxes which is far outweighed by the tax cuts which will benefit individuals.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_100.wav|There is an excise tax on cigarettes, another on telephones.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_101.wav|Well, for people who smoke a pack a day, that tax will mean an increase of only $2.40 a month.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_102.wav|The telephone tax increase is only about $0.54 a month for the average household.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_103.wav|Right now, the tax reduction that we passed last year is saving the average family about $400 per year.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_104.wav|Next year, even after this new tax bill is passed, the savings will almost double.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_105.wav|They'll go to $788.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_106.wav|And here's what the totals look like.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_107.wav|The new tax reform will raise in three years, about, as I say, $99 billion.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_108.wav|In the same three years, as I said a moment ago, our tax cut program, even after this increase, will save you $335 billion.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_109.wav|Within the new bill, there has, of course, been disagreement over some of the specific provisions.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_110.wav|For example, there's considerable confusion over the proposal to have withholding of tax due on interest in dividends, just as it's withheld now on your wages and salaries.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_111.wav|Many senior citizens have been led to believe this is a new tax added on top of the present income tax.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_112.wav|Well, there is no truth whatsoever to that.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_113.wav|We've found that while the overwhelming majority of Americans faithfully report income from interest in dividends and pay taxes on it, some do not.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_114.wav|It's one of the significant areas of non-compliance and is costing the government about $9 billion a year.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_115.wav|In the case of those over age 65, withholding will only apply to those with incomes of $14,450 end up per individual and $24,214 for couples filing a joint return.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_116.wav|Low income citizens below 65 will be exempt if their income is less than about $8,000 for an individual or $15,300 for those filing joint returns.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_117.wav|And there will be an exemption for all interest payments of $150 or less.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_118.wav|The only people whose taxes will be increased by this withholding are those who presently are evading their fair share of the tax burden.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_119.wav|Once again, we're striving to see that all taxpayers are treated fairly.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_120.wav|Now this withholding will go into effect next July, not this January 1st as was earlier reported.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_121.wav|Back during the campaign on September 9, 1980 to be exact, I said my goal was to reduce by 1985 the share of the gross national product taken by the government in taxes, reduce it to 20.5%.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_122.wav|If we had done nothing, it would have risen to almost 25%.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_123.wav|But even after passage of this bill, the federal government in 1985 will only be taking 19.6% of the gross national product.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_124.wav|Make no mistake about it.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_125.wav|This whole package is a compromise.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_126.wav|I had to swallow hard to agree to any revenue increase.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_127.wav|But there are two sides to a compromise.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_128.wav|Those who supported the increased revenues swallowed hard to accept $280 billion in outlay cuts.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_129.wav|Others have accepted specific provisions with regard to taxes or spending cuts, which they opposed.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_130.wav|There's a provision in the bill for extended unemployment payments in states particularly hard hit by unemployment.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_131.wav|If this gives up their benefits by the end of March.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_132.wav|I repeat, much of this bill will make our tax system more fair for every American, especially those in lower income brackets.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_133.wav|I'm still dedicated to reducing the level of spending until it's within our income.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_134.wav|And I still want to see the base of the economy broadened so that the individual's tax burden can be further reduced.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_135.wav|Over the years, growth in government and deficit spending have been built into our system.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_136.wav|How to be nice if we could just cut that out of our system with a single sharp slice.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_137.wav|That, however, can't be done without bringing great hardship down on many of our less fortunate neighbors who are not in a position to provide for themselves.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_138.wav|And none of us wants that.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_139.wav|Our effort to restore fiscal integrity and common sense to the federal establishment isn't limited to the budget cuts and tax policy.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_140.wav|Vice President Bush heads up a task force that's been reviewing excessive regulations.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_141.wav|Already, enough unnecessary and duplicative regulations have been eliminated or revised to save an estimated $6 billion every year.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_142.wav|Our inspectors general have been mobilized in with task force aimed at ferriting out waste and fraud.

wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_151.wav|We need the bipartisan comprehensive package of revenue increases and spending cuts.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_152.wav|Now before the Congress, we need it to be passed.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_153.wav|We're not proposing a quick fix, an artificial stimulus to the economy, such as we've seen in the several recessions in recent years.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_154.wav|The present recession is bottoming out without resorting to quick fixes.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_155.wav|Now there won't be a sudden boom or upsurge, but slowly and surely we'll have a sound and lasting recovery based on solid values at increased productivity and an end to deficit spending.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_156.wav|It may not be easy, but it's the best way, the only way to reel and lasting prosperity for all our people.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_157.wav|Think of it, we've only had one balanced budget in the last 20 years.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_158.wav|Let's look forward to the day when we begin making payments to reduce the national debt instead of turning it all over to our children.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_159.wav|You helped us start this economic recovery program last year.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_160.wav|When you told your representatives you wanted it.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_161.wav|You can help again, whether you're a Republican, a Democrat, or an independent, by letting them know that you want it continued.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_162.wav|Letting them know that you understand that this legislation is a price worth paying for lower interest rates, economic recovery, and more jobs.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_163.wav|The single most important question facing us tonight is, do we reduce deficits and interest rates by raising revenue from those who are not now paying a fair share, or do we accept bigger budget deficits, higher interest rates, and higher unemployment, simply because we disagree on certain features of a legislative package which offers hope for millions of Americans at home, on the farm, and in the workplace.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_164.wav|Do we tell these Americans to give up hope that their ship of state lies dead in the water, because those entrusted with manning that ship can't agree on which sailed arrays?
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_165.wav|We're within sight of the safe port of economic recovery.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_166.wav|Do we make port or go a ground on the shores of selfishness, partisanship, and just plain bullheadedness?
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_167.wav|The measure the Congress is about to vote on, while not perfect in the eyes of any one of us, will bring us closer to the goal of a balanced budget, restored industrial power, and employment for all who want to work.

wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_002.wav|For four long years, much of Europe had been under a terrible shadow.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_003.wav|Free nations had fallen, Jews cried out in the camps, millions cried out for liberation.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_004.wav|Europe was enslaved and the world prayed for its rescue.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_005.wav|Here in Normandy, the rescue began.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_006.wav|Here the Allies stood and fought against tyranny and a giant undertaking unparalleled in human history.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_007.wav|We stand on a lonely wind-sweat point on the northern shore of France.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_008.wav|The air was soft, but 40 years ago at this moment, the air was dense with smoke and the cries of men and the air was filled with the crack of rifle fire in the roar of cannon.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_009.wav|At dawn on the morning of the 6th of June, 1944, 225 Rangers jumped off the British landing craft and ran to the bottom of these cliffs.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_010.wav|Their mission was one of the most difficult and daring of the invasion to climb these sheer and desolate cliffs and take out the enemy guns.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_011.wav|The Allies had been told that some of the mightiest of these guns were here and they would be trained on the beaches to stop the Allied advance.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_012.wav|The Rangers looked up and saw the enemy soldiers, the edge of the cliffs shooting down at them with machine guns and throwing grenades and the American Rangers began to climb.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_013.wav|They shot rope ladders over the face of these cliffs and began to pull themselves up.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_014.wav|When one Ranger fell, another would take his place.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_015.wav|When one rope was cut, a Ranger would grab another and begin his climb again.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_016.wav|They climbed, shot back and held their footing.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_017.wav|Soon one by one, the Rangers pulled themselves over the top and in seizing the firm land at the top of these cliffs, they began to seize back the continent of Europe.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_018.wav|225 came here.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_019.wav|After two days of fighting, only 90 could steal bear arms.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_020.wav|Behind me is a memorial that symbolizes the Ranger daggers that were thrust into the top of these cliffs and before me are the men who put them there.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_021.wav|These are the champions who helped free a continent.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_022.wav|These are the heroes who helped end a war.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_023.wav|Gentlemen, I look at you and I think of the words of Stephen Spender's poem.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_024.wav|You were men who in your quote, lives fought for life and left the vivid air signed with your honor.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_025.wav|I think I know what you may be thinking right now.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_026.wav|Thinking we were just part of a bigger effort, everyone was brave that day.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_027.wav|Well, everyone was.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_028.wav|You remember the story of Bill Millen of the 51st Highlanders?
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_029.wav|40 years ago today, British troops were pinned down near a bridge, waiting desperately for help.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_030.wav|Suddenly they heard the sound of bagpipes and some thought they were dreaming.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_031.wav|Well, they weren't.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_032.wav|They looked up and saw Bill Millen with his bagpipes leading the reinforcements and ignoring the smack of the ground around him.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_033.wav|Lord Love it was with him.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_034.wav|Lord Love it of Scotland who calmly announced when he got to the bridge.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_035.wav|Sorry, I'm a few minutes late as if he'd been delayed by a traffic jam.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_036.wav|When in truth he'd just come from the bloody fighting on sword beach which he and his men had just taken.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_037.wav|There was the impossible valor of the Poles who threw themselves between the enemy and the rest of Europe as the invasion took hold.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_038.wav|And the unsurpassed courage of the Canadians who had already seen the horrors of war on this coast.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_039.wav|They knew what awaited them there, but they would not be deterred.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_040.wav|And once they hit Juno Beach, they never looked back.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_041.wav|All of these men were part of a roll call of honor, with names that spoke of a pride as bright as the colors they bore.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_042.wav|The Royal Winnipeg Rifles, Poland's 24th Lancers, the Royal Scots Fusiliers, the screaming Eagles, the Yomon of England's Armored Divisions, the forces of Free France, the Coast Guard's matchbox fleet, and you, the American Rangers.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_043.wav|Forty summers have passed since the battle that you fought here.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_044.wav|You were young the day you took these cliffs.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_045.wav|Some of you were hardly more than boys with the deepest joys of life before you, yet you risked everything here.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_046.wav|Why?
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_047.wav|Why did you do it?
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_048.wav|Well, what impelled you to put aside the instinct for self-preservation and risk your lives to take these cliffs?
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_049.wav|What inspired all the men of the armies that met here?
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_050.wav|We look at you and somehow we know the answer.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_051.wav|It was faith and belief.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_052.wav|It was loyalty and love.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_053.wav|The men of Normandy had faith that what they were doing was right.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_054.wav|Faith that they fought for all humanity.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_055.wav|Faith that deep knowledge and pray,
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_056.wav|God, we have not lost it, that there is a profound moral difference between the use of force for liberation and the use of force for conquest.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_057.wav|You were here to liberate not to conquer, and so you and those others did not doubt your cause, and you were right not to doubt.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_058.wav|You all knew that some things are worth dying for.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_059.wav|One's country is worth dying for, and democracy is worth dying for because it's the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised by man.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_060.wav|All of you loved liberty.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_061.wav|All of you were willing to fight tyranny, and you knew the people of your countries were behind you.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_062.wav|The Americans who fought here that morning knew word of the invasion was spreading through the darkness back home.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_063.wav|They fought or felt in their hearts though they couldn't know, in fact, that in Georgia they were filling the churches at 4 a.m.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_064.wav|In Kansas they were kneeling on their porches and praying, and in Philadelphia they were ringing the liberty bell.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_065.wav|Something else helped the men of D.D.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_066.wav|The rock hard belief that providence would have a great hand in the events that would unfold here, that God was an ally in this great cause.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_067.wav|And so the night before the invasion, when Colonel Wouverton asked his parachute troops to kneel with him in prayer.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_068.wav|He told them, do not bow your heads, but look up so you can see God and ask his blessing in what we are about to do.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_069.wav|Also that night General Matthew Richway on his cot, listening in the darkness for the promise God made to Joshua,
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_070.wav|I will not fail thee nor forsake thee.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_071.wav|These are the things that impelled him.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_072.wav|These are the things that shaped the unity of the allies.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_073.wav|When the war was over, there were lives to be rebuilt and governments to be returned to the people.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_074.wav|There were nations to be reborn.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_075.wav|Above all there was a new peace to be assured.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_076.wav|These were huge and daunting tasks, but the allies summoned strength from the faith, belief, loyalty and love of those who fell here.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_077.wav|They rebuilt a new Europe together.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_078.wav|There was first a great reconciliation among those who had been enemies, all of whom it suffered so greatly.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_079.wav|The United States did its part, creating the Marshall Plan to help rebuild our allies and our former enemies.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_080.wav|The Marshall Plan led to the Atlantic Alliance, a great alliance that serves to this day as our shield for freedom, for prosperity and for peace.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_081.wav|In spite of our great efforts and successes, not all that followed the end of the war was happier planned.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_082.wav|Some liberated countries were lost.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_083.wav|The great sadness of this loss echoes down to our own time and the streets of Warsaw, Prague and East Berlin.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_084.wav|The Soviet troops that came to the center of this continent did not leave when peace came.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_085.wav|They're still there, uninvited, unwanted, unyielding, almost 40 years after the war.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_086.wav|Because of this, allied forces still stand on this continent.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_087.wav|Today, as 40 years ago, our armies are here for only one purpose to protect and defend democracy.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_088.wav|The only territories we hold are memorials like this one and graveyards where our heroes rest.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_089.wav|We in America have learned bitter lessons from two world wars.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_090.wav|It is better to be here ready to protect the peace than to take blind shelter across the sea, rushing to respond only after freedom is lost.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_091.wav|We've learned that isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical governments within expansionist intent.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_092.wav|But we try always to be prepared for peace, prepared to deter aggression, prepared to negotiate the reduction of arms, and, yes, prepared to reach out again in the spirit of reconciliation.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_093.wav|In truth, there is no reconciliation we would welcome more than a reconciliation with the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_094.wav|So together, we can listen less than the risk of war now and forever.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_095.wav|It's fitting to remember, here, the great loss is also suffered by the Russian people during World War II.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_096.wav|20 million perished, a terrible price that testifies to all the world and necessity of ending war.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_097.wav|I tell you from my heart that we in the United States do not want war.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_098.wav|We want a wipe from the face of the earth, the terrible weapons that man now has in his hands.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_099.wav|And I tell you, we are ready to seize that beachhead.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_100.wav|We look for some sign from the Soviet Union that they are willing to move forward, that they share our desire and love for peace, and that they will give up the ways of conquest.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_101.wav|There must be a changing there that will allow us to turn our hope into action.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_102.wav|We will pray forever that someday that changing will come.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_103.wav|But for now, particularly today, it is good and fitting to renew our commitment to each other, to our freedom and to the alliance that protects it.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_104.wav|We are bound today by what bound us 40 years ago, the same loyalties, traditions, and beliefs.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_105.wav|We are bound by reality.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_106.wav|The strength of America's allies is vital to the United States and the American security guarantee is essential to the continued freedom of Europe's democracies.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_107.wav|We were with you then, we are with you now.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_108.wav|Your hopes are our hopes and your destiny is our destiny.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_109.wav|Here in this place where the West held together, let us make a vow to our dead.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_110.wav|Let us show them by our actions that we understand what they died for.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_111.wav|Let our actions say to them the words for which Matthew, Ridgeway listened,
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_112.wav|I will not fail thee nor forsake thee.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_113.wav|Strengthened by their courage, heartened by their value and born by their memory, let us continue to stand for the ideals for which they lived and died.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_114.wav|Thank you very much and God bless you all.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_001.wav|uh, governing mayor, deepkin, ladies and gentlemen,
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_002.wav|24 years ago, president, john f. kennedy, visited Berlin.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_003.wav|And speaking to the people of this city and the world at the city hall, well since then two other presidents have come, each in his turn to Berlin.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_004.wav|And today I myself make my second visit to speak in this place of freedom.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_005.wav|But I must confess, we're drawn here by other things as well, by the feeling of history in this city, more than 500 years older than our own nation, by the beauty of the green walled in the tear garden, most of all by your courage and determination.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_006.wav|Perhaps the composer Paul Linky understood something about American presidents.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_007.wav|You see, like so many presidents before me,
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_008.wav|I come here today because wherever I go, whatever I do, ish habna kainan koffer in Berlin.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_009.wav|I understand that it is being seen and heard as well in the east.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_010.wav|To those listening throughout Eastern Europe, I extend my warmest greetings and the good will of the American people.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_011.wav|To those listening in East Berlin, a special word.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_012.wav|Although I cannot be with you, I address my remarks to you just as surely as to those standing here before me.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_013.wav|For I join you, as I join your fellow countrymen in the West in this firm, this unalterable belief, as give it no rine Berlin.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_014.wav|Behind me stands a wall that encircles the free sectors of this city, part of a vast system of barriers that divides the entire continent of Europe.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_015.wav|From the Baltic South, those barriers cut across Germany in a gash of barbed wire, concrete, dog runs and guard towers.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_016.wav|Farther south, there may be no visible, no obvious wall, but the remain armed guards and checkpoints all the same.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_017.wav|Still a restriction on the right to travel.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_018.wav|Still an instrument to impose upon ordinary men and women, the will of a totalitarian state.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_019.wav|Yet it is here in Berlin where the wall emerges most clearly, here cutting across your city, where the news photo on the television screen have imprinted this brutal division of a continent upon the mind of the world.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_020.wav|Standing before the Brandenburg Gate, every man is a German separated from his fellow men.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_021.wav|Forced to look upon a scar.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_022.wav|President von Weitzacher has said the German question is open as long as the Brandenburg Gate is closed.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_023.wav|As long as this scar of a wall is permitted to stand, I do not come here to lament, for I find in Berlin a message of hope, even in the shadow of this wall, a message of triumph.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_024.wav|In this season of spring in 1945, the people of Berlin emerged from their air-raid shelters to find devastation.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_025.wav|Thousands of miles away, the people of the United States reached out to help.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_026.wav|And in 1947, Secretary of State, as you've been told, George Marshall announced the creation of what would become known as the Marshall Plan.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_027.wav|Speaking precisely 40 years ago this month, he said, our policy is directed not against any country or doctrine, but against hunger, poverty, desperation, and chaos.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_028.wav|I saw a display commemorating this 40th anniversary of the Marshall Plan.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_029.wav|I was struck by a sawdust sign on a burnt-out gutted structure that was being rebuilt.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_030.wav|I understand that Berliners of my own generation can remember seeing signs like it dotted throughout the western sectors of the city.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_031.wav|The sign read simply, the Marshall Plan is helping here to strengthen the free world.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_032.wav|A strong free world in the West, that dream became real.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_033.wav|Japan rose from ruin to become an economic giant.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_034.wav|Italy, France, Belgium, virtually every nation in Western Europe saw political and economic rebirth.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_035.wav|The European community was founded.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_036.wav|In West Germany and here in Berlin, there took place an economic miracle.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_037.wav|The Vert Schaafsvandeer, Adenauer, Erhardt, Reiter, and other leaders understood the practical importance of liberty.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_038.wav|That just as truth can flourish only when the journalist is given freedom of speech.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_039.wav|So prosperity can come about only when the farmer and businessmen enjoy economic freedom.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_040.wav|The German leaders reduced tariffs, expanded free trade, lowered taxes from 1950 to 1960 alone, the standard of living in West Germany and Berlin doubled.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_041.wav|Where four decades ago there was rubble, today in West Berlin there was the greatest industrial output of any city in Germany, busy office blocks, fine homes and apartments, proud avenues and the spreading lawns of Parkland, where a city's culture seemed to have been destroyed, today there are two great universities, orchestras and an opera, countless theaters and museums, where there was want, today there's abundance, food, clothing, automobiles, the wonderful goods of the Kudem, from devastation, from utter ruin, you burliners have in freedom rebuild a city that once again ranks as one of the greatest on earth.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_042.wav|The Soviets may have had other plans, but my friends there were a few things the Soviets didn't count on.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_043.wav|In the 1950s, cruise chief predicted we will bury you, but in the West today we see a free world that has achieved a level of prosperity and well-being unprecedented in all human history.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_044.wav|In the communist world, we see failure, technological backwardness, declining standards of health, even want of the most basic kind, too little food, even today the Soviet Union still cannot feed itself.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_045.wav|After these four decades then there stands before the entire world one great and inescapable conclusion.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_046.wav|Freedom leads to prosperity, freedom replaces the ancient hatreds among nations with comedy and peace, freedom is the victor.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_047.wav|Now the Soviets themselves may in a limited way be coming to understand the importance of freedom.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_048.wav|We hear much from Moscow about a new policy of reform and openness, some political prisoners have been released, certain foreign news broadcasts are no longer being jammed, some economic enterprises have been permitted to operate with greater freedom from state control.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_049.wav|Are these the beginnings of profound changes in the Soviet state or are they token gestures intended to raise false hopes in the West or to strengthen the Soviet system without changing it?
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_050.wav|We welcome change and openness for we believe that freedom and security go together, that the advance of human liberty can only strengthen the cause of world peace.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_051.wav|There is one sign the Soviets can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_052.wav|General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization, come here to this gate.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_053.wav|Mr. Gorbachev, and I pledge to you my country's efforts to help overcome these burdens, to be sure we in the West must pre-resist Soviet expansion.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_054.wav|So we must maintain defenses of unassailable strength, yet we seek peace so we must strive to reduce arms on both sides.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_055.wav|Beginning 10 years ago, the Soviets challenged the Western Alliance with a grave new threat, hundreds of new and more deadly SS-20 nuclear missiles, capable of striking every capital in Europe.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_056.wav|The Western Alliance responded by committing itself to a counter deployment, unless the Soviets agreed to negotiate a better solution, namely the elimination of such weapons on both sides.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_057.wav|For many months, the Soviets refused to bargain in earnestness.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_058.wav|As the Alliance in turn prepared to go forward with its counter deployment, there were difficult days, days of protests, like those during my 1982 visit to this city.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_059.wav|And the Soviets later walked away from the table, but through it all, the Alliance held firm, and I invite those who protested then.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_060.wav|I invite those who protested today to mark this fact, because we remain strong, we have within reach the possibility not merely of limiting the growth of arms, but of eliminating for the first time.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_061.wav|And entire class of nuclear weapons from the face of the earth.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_062.wav|As I speak, NATO ministers are meeting in Iceland to review the progress of our proposals for eliminating these weapons.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_063.wav|At the talks in Geneva, we have also proposed deep cuts in strategic offensive weapons.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_064.wav|And the Western Allies have likewise made far-reaching proposals to reduce the danger of conventional war and to place a total ban on chemical weapons.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_065.wav|While we pursue these arms reductions, I pledge to you that we will maintain the capacity to deter Soviet aggression at any level at which it might occur.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_066.wav|The United States is pursuing the Strategic Defense Initiative, research to base deterrence not on the threat of offensive retaliation, but on defenses that truly defend, on systems in short that will not target populations, but shield them.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_067.wav|By these means, we seek to increase the safety of Europe and all the world.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_068.wav|But we must remember a crucial fact.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_069.wav|East and West do not mistrust each other because we are armed.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_070.wav|But about liberty.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_071.wav|When President Kennedy spoke at the city hall those 24 years ago, freedom was encircled.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_072.wav|Berlin was under siege.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_073.wav|And today, despite all the pressures upon this city, Berlin stands secure in its liberty.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_074.wav|And freedom itself is transforming the globe.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_075.wav|In the Philippines, in South and Central America, democracy has been given a rebirth.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_076.wav|Throughout the Pacific, free markets are working miracle after miracle of economic growth.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_077.wav|In the industrialized nations, a technological revolution is taking place.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_078.wav|A revolution marked by rapid dramatic advances in computers and telecommunications.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_079.wav|In Europe, only one nation and those it controls refuse to join the community of freedom.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_080.wav|Yet in this age of redoubled economic growth, of information and innovation, the Soviet Union faces a choice.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_081.wav|It must make fundamental changes or it will become obsolete.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_082.wav|We in the West stand ready to cooperate with the East to promote true openness, to break down barriers that separate people, to create a safer, freer world.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_083.wav|And surely there is no better place than Berlin, the meeting place of East and West, to make a start.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_084.wav|And full implementation of all parts of the four-power agreement of 1971.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_085.wav|Let us use this occasion, the 750th anniversary of this city, to usher in a new era, to seek a still fuller richer life for the Berlin of the future.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_086.wav|Together, let us maintain and develop the ties between the Federal Republic and the Western sectors of Berlin, which is permitted by the 1971 agreement.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_087.wav|And I invite Mr. Gorbachev, let us work to bring the eastern and western parts of the city closer together.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_088.wav|Let us expand the vital air access to this city, finding ways of making commercial air service to Berlin more convenient, more comfortable and more economical.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_089.wav|We look to the day when West Berlin can become one of the chief aviation hubs in all central Europe.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_090.wav|The United States is prepared to help bring international meetings to Berlin.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_091.wav|It would be only fitting for Berlin to serve as the site of United Nations meetings, or world conferences on human rights and arms control.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_092.wav|There is no better way to establish hope for the future than to enlighten young minds.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_093.wav|And we would be honored to sponsor summer youth exchanges, cultural events, and other programs for young Berliners from the East.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_094.wav|Our French and British friends, I'm certain, will do the same.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_095.wav|And it's my hope that an authority can be found in East Berlin to sponsor visits from young people of the Western sectors.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_096.wav|Sport represents a source of enjoyment and enobleness, and you may have noted that the Republic of Korea, South Korea, has offered to permit certain events of the 1988 Olympics to take place in the North.

wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_098.wav|And what better way to demonstrate to the world the openness of this city than to offer in some future year?
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_099.wav|You, Berliners, have built a great city.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_100.wav|You've done so in spite of threats.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_101.wav|The Soviet attempts to impose the Eastmark, the blockade.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_102.wav|Today, the city thrives in spite of the challenges implicit in the very presence of this wall.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_103.wav|What keeps you here?
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_104.wav|Certainly, there's a great deal to be said for your fortitude, for your defiant courage, but I believe there's something deeper.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_105.wav|Something that involves Berlin's whole look and feel and way of life.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_106.wav|Not mere sentiment.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_107.wav|No one could live long in Berlin without being completely disabused of illusions.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_108.wav|Something instead that has seen the difficulties of life in Berlin but chose to accept them.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_109.wav|That continues to build this good and proud city in contrast to a surrounding totalitarian presence that refuses to release human energies or aspirations.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_110.wav|Something that speaks with a powerful voice of affirmation that says yes to this city, yes to the future, yes to freedom.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_111.wav|In a word, I would submit that what keeps you in Berlin is love.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_112.wav|Perhaps this gets to the root of the matter, to the most fundamental distinction of all between East and West.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_113.wav|The totalitarian world produces backwardness because it does such violence to the spirit, thwarting the human impulse to create, to enjoy, to worship.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_114.wav|The totalitarian world finds even symbols of love and of worship and affront.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_115.wav|Years ago, before the East Germans began rebuilding their churches, they erected a secular structure, the television tower at Alexander Plats.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_116.wav|Virtually ever since, the authorities have been working to correct what they view as the tower's one major flaw.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_117.wav|Treating the glass sphere at the top with paints and chemicals of every kind, yet even today, when the sun strikes that sphere, that sphere that towers over all Berlin, the light, symbols of love, symbols of worship, cannot be suppressed.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_118.wav|As I looked out a moment ago from the Reichstag, that embodiment of German unity, I noticed words crudely spray painted upon the wall, perhaps by a younger linear.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_119.wav|Quote, this wall will fall, beliefs become reality.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_120.wav|Across Europe, this wall will fall, for it cannot withstand faith, it cannot withstand truth, the wall cannot withstand freedom.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_121.wav|And I would like, for I close to say one word.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_122.wav|I have read and I have been questioned since I have been here about certain demonstrations against my coming, and I would like to say just one thing, and to those who demonstrate so.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_123.wav|I wonder if they have ever asked themselves that if they should have the kind of government they apparently seek.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_001.wav|just a speaker, president, distinguished members of the house and senate.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_002.wav|When we first met here seven years ago, many of us for the first time, it was with the hope of beginning something new for America.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_003.wav|Me here tonight in this historic chamber to continue that work.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_004.wav|If anyone expects just a proud recitation of the accomplishments of my administration, I say let's leave that to history.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_005.wav|We're not finished yet.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_006.wav|Power of the ideas that brought us here those seven years ago, ideas like the individuals right to reach as far and as high as his or her talents will permit.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_007.wav|The free market as an engine of economic progress and as an ancient Chinese philosopher, Lao Tzu said, govern a great nation as you would cook a small fish.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_008.wav|Do not overdo it.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_009.wav|Well, these ideas were part of a larger notion of vision if you will of America herself, an American not only rich in opportunity for the individual, but an America too of strong families and vibrant neighborhoods and America whose divergent but harmonizing communities were a reflection of a deeper community of values.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_010.wav|The value of work, of family, of religion, and of the love of freedom that God places in each of us and whose defense he is entrusted in a special way to this nation.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_011.wav|All of this was made possible by an idea I spoke of when Mr. Gorbachev was here.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_012.wav|The belief that the most exciting revolution ever known to humankind began with three simple words, we, the people.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_013.wav|The revolutionary notion that the people grant government its rights and not the other way around.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_014.wav|And there's one lesson that has come home powerfully with me which I would offer to you now, just as those who created this republic pledged to each other their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_015.wav|So too, America's leaders today must pledge to each other that we will keep foremost in our hearts and minds not what is best for ourselves or for our party.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_016.wav|But what is best, there are no republicans, no Democrats, just Americans.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_017.wav|Yes, we will have our differences but let us always remember what unites us far outweighs whatever divides us.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_018.wav|Those who sent us here to serve them, the millions of Americans watching and listening tonight expect this of us.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_019.wav|Let's prove to them and to ourselves that democracy works even in an election year.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_020.wav|We've done this before and as we've worked together to bring down spending, tax rates and inflation, employment has climbed to record heights, America has created more jobs and better higher paying jobs, family income has risen for four straight years, and America's poor climbed out of poverty at the fastest rate, not just the longest peacetime expansion in history, but an economic and social revolution of hope based on work, incentives, growth and opportunity.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_021.wav|A revolution of compassion that led to private sector initiatives and a 77% increase in charitable giving.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_022.wav|A revolution that at a critical moment in world history reclaimed and restored the American dream.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_023.wav|In international relations too there's only one description for what together we have achieved.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_024.wav|A complete turnabout, a revolution seven years ago, America was weak and freedom everywhere, was under siege.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_025.wav|Today America is strong and democracy is everywhere on the move.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_026.wav|From Central America to East Asia, ideas like free markets and democratic reforms and human rights are taking hold.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_027.wav|We've replaced blame America, none can give us more satisfaction than knowing that our young people are again proud, arms reduction, the strategic defense initiative, and the global democratic revolution that when taken together offered a chance none of us would have dared imagine seven years ago, a chance to rid the world of the two great nightmares of the postwar era.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_028.wav|I speak of the startling hope of giving our children a future free of both totalitarianism and nuclear terror.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_029.wav|Tonight then we're strong, prosperous, at peace and we are free.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_030.wav|This is the state of our union and if we will work together this year I believe we can give a future president and a future congress the chance to make that prosperity that peace that freedom, not just the state of our union but the state of our world.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_031.wav|Steps we can take this year to keep our economy strong and growing, to give our children a future of low inflation and full employment.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_032.wav|Second, let's check our progress in attacking social problems where important gains have been made but which still need critical attention.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_033.wav|I mean schools that work, economic independence for the poor, restoring respect for family life and family values.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_034.wav|Our third objective tonight is global, continuing the exciting economic and democratic revolutions we've seen around the world.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_035.wav|Fourth and finally our nation has remained at peace for nearly a decade and a half as we move toward our goals of world prosperity and world freedom.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_036.wav|We must protect that peace and deter war by making sure the next president inherits what you and I have a moral obligation to give that president, a national security that is unassailable and a national defense that takes full advantage of new technology and is fully funded.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_037.wav|You see my thinking on the next year is quite simple.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_038.wav|Let's make this the best of eight.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_039.wav|I don't buy the idea that this is the last year of anything because we're not talking here tonight about registering temporary gains but ways of making permanent our successes and that's why our focus is the values, the principles and ideas that made America great.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_040.wav|Let's be clear on this point, we're for limited government because we understand as the founding fathers did that it is the best way of ensuring personal liberty and empowering the individual so that every American of every race and region shares fully in the flowering of American prosperity and freedom.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_041.wav|One of the thing we Americans like the future, like the sound of it, the idea of it, the hope of it, where others fear trade and economic growth, we see opportunities for creating new wealth and un dreamed of opportunities for millions in our own land and beyond.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_042.wav|Where others seek to throw up barriers, we seek to bring them down, where others take counsel of their fears, we follow our hopes.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_043.wav|Yes, we Americans like the future and like making the most of it.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_044.wav|Let's do that now and let's begin by discussing how to maintain economic growth by controlling eventually eliminating the problem of federal deficits.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_045.wav|We have had a federal, a balanced budget only eight times in the last 57 years.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_046.wav|For the first time in 14 years, the federal government spent less in real terms last year than the year before.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_047.wav|We took 73 billion dollars off last year's deficit compared to the year before.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_048.wav|The deficit itself has moved from 6.3 percent of the gross national product to only 3.4 percent and perhaps the most important sign of progress has been the change in our view of deficits.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_049.wav|You know, a few of us can remember when not too many years ago, those who created the deficits said they would make us prosperous and not to worry about the debt because we owe it to ourselves.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_050.wav|But at last, there is agreement that we can't spend ourselves rich.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_051.wav|Our recent budget agreement designed to reduce federal deficits by 76 billion dollars over the next two years builds on this consensus.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_052.wav|But this agreement must be adhered to without slipping into the errors of the past.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_053.wav|More broken promises and more unchecked spending.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_054.wav|As I indicated in my first state of the union, what ails us can be simply put.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_055.wav|It's also time for some plain talk about the most immediate obstacle to controlling federal deficits for simple but frustrating problem of making expenses match revenues.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_056.wav|Something American families do and the federal government can't has caused crisis after crisis in this city.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_057.wav|Mr. Speaker,
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_058.wav|Mr. President,
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_059.wav|I will say to you tonight what I've said before and will continue to say the budget process has broken down.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_060.wav|It needs a drastic overhaul.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_061.wav|Monstrous continuing resolutions that pack hundreds of billions of dollars worth of spending into one bill and a federal government on the brink of default.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_062.wav|I know I'm echoing what you here in the Congress have said because you suffered so directly.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_063.wav|But let's recall that in seven years of 91 appropriations, bills scheduled to arrive on my desk by a certain date only 10 made it on time.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_064.wav|Last year of the 13 appropriations bills due by October 1st, none of them made it.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_065.wav|Instead we had four continuing resolutions lasting 41 days, then 36 days, and two days, and three days respectively.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_066.wav|That was 1186 pages long weighing 15 pounds.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_067.wav|And the long-term continuing resolution, you had three hours.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_068.wav|Yes, three hours to consider each.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_069.wav|And it took 300 people, my office of management and budget, just to read the bill so the government wouldn't shut down.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_070.wav|And a congressional budget resolution that is not enforced, why not a simple partnership, a joint agreement that sets out the spending priorities within the available revenues.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_071.wav|13 individual bills on time and fully reviewed by Congress.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_072.wav|I'm also certain you join me in saying let's help ensure our future of prosperity by giving the president a tool that though I will not get used to use it, is one I know future presidents of either party must have.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_073.wav|Give the president the same authority that 43 governors use in their states the right to reach into massive appropriation bills, pair away the waste and enforce budget discipline.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_074.wav|Most of you in this chamber didn't know what was in this catch-all bill and report.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_075.wav|Over the past few weeks we've all learned what was tucked away behind a little comma here and there.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_076.wav|For example, there's millions for items such as cranberry research, blueberry research, the study of crawfish, and the commercialization of wildflowers.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_077.wav|And that's not to mention the five or so million that is so that people from developing nations could come here to watch Congress at work.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_078.wav|I won't even touch that.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_079.wav|So tonight I offer you this challenge.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_080.wav|In 30 days I will send back to you those items as decisions which if I had the authority to line them out I would do so.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_081.wav|As a matter of fact if adopted it will improve our deficit reduction goals and what an example we can set that we're serious about getting our financial accounts in order.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_082.wav|By acting and approving this plan you have the opportunity to override a congressional process that is out of control.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_083.wav|There is another vital reform.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_084.wav|Yes, Graham Rudman Hollings has been profoundly helpful but let us take its goal of a balanced budget and make it permanent.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_085.wav|Let us do now what so many states do to hold down spending and what 32 state legislatures have asked us to do that has heeded the wishes of an overwhelming plurality of Americans and pass a constitutional amendment that mandates a balanced budget will together with real restraint on government spending prevent the federal budget from ever again ravaging the family budget.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_086.wav|Let's ensure that the federal government never again legislates against the family and the home.

wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_090.wav|We all know the sorry story of the 60s and 70s soaring spending plummeting test scores and that hopeful trend of the 80s when we replaced an obsession with dollars with a commitment to quality and test scores started back up.

wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_094.wav|How can we help?
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_095.wav|Well we can talk about and push for these reforms but the most important thing we can do is to reaffirm that control of our schools belongs to the states and poverty one.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_096.wav|Today the federal government has 59 major welfare programs and spends more than a hundred billion dollars a year on.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_097.wav|What is all this money done?
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_098.wav|Well too often it is only made poverty harder to escape federal welfare programs have created a massive social problem with the best of intentions.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_099.wav|Government created a poverty trap that wrecks havoc on the very support system the poor need most to lift themselves out of poverty the family.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_100.wav|Dependency has become the one enduring heirloom passed from one generation to the next of too many fragmented families.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_101.wav|It's time this may be the most radical thing I've said in seven years in office it's time for Washington to show a little humility.

wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_103.wav|States have begun to show us the way they've demonstrated that successful welfare programs can be built around more effective child support enforcement practices and innovative programs requiring welfare recipients to work or prepare for work.

wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_106.wav|The first is an untold American success story.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_107.wav|Recently we released our annual survey of what graduating high school seniors have to say about drugs.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_108.wav|Cocaine use is declining and marijuana use was the lowest since surveying began.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_109.wav|We can be proud that our students are just saying but let us remember what this menace requires commitment from every part of America and every single American a commitment to drug-free America.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_110.wav|The war against drugs is a war of individual battles a crusade with many heroes including America's young people and also someone very special to me.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_111.wav|She has helped so many of our young people to say no to drugs.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_112.wav|Tonight I call America a good nation a moral people to charitable realistic consideration of the terrible cost of abortion on demand.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_113.wav|To say to those who say this violates a woman's right to control of her own body can they deny that now medical evidence confirms the unborn child and protect the unborn with legislation that would stop all federal funding for abortion and with a human life amendment making of course an exception where the unborn child threatens the life of the mother.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_114.wav|Arduedale Christian tradition recognizes the right of taking a life in self-defense but with that one exception let us look to those others in our land who cry out for children to adopt.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_115.wav|I pledge to you tonight I will work to remove barriers to adoption and extend full sharing and family life to millions of Americans so that children who need homes can be welcomed to families who want them and love them and vigor.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_116.wav|The Congress opens its proceedings each day as does the Supreme Court with an acknowledgement of the Supreme being.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_117.wav|Yet we are denied the right to set aside in our schools a moment each day for those who wish to pray.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_118.wav|Nine members Supreme Court to interpret the law to protect the lights of rights of all Americans I urge the Senate to move quickly and decisively in confirming Judge Anthony Kennedy to the highest court in the land and to also confirm 27 nominees now waiting to fill vacancies in the federal judiciary.

wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_132.wav|Today over 90% of Latin Americans live in nations committed to democratic principles and the resurgence of democracy is old to these courageous people on almost every continent who have struggled to take control of their own destiny.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_133.wav|In Nicaragua the struggle has extra meaning because that nation is so near our own borders.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_134.wav|The recent revelations of a former high level Sandinista Major Roger Miranda show us that even as they talk peace the communist Sandinista government of Nicaragua has established plans for a large 600,000 man army.

wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_137.wav|The focus is on the Sandinistas their promises and their actions.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_138.wav|There is a consensus among the four Central American Democratic presidents that the Sandinistas have not complied with the plan to bring peace and democracy to all of Central America.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_139.wav|The Sandinistas again have promised reforms their challenge is to take irreversible steps toward democracy.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_140.wav|On Wednesday my request to sustain the freedom fighters will be submitted which reflects our mutual desire for peace freedom and democracy in Nicaragua.

wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_002.wav|Mr. President, distinguished members of the Congress honored guests and fellow citizens.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_003.wav|This solemn occasion marks the 196th time that a president of the United States has reported on the State of the Union since George Washington first did so in 1790.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_004.wav|That's a lot of reports, but there's no shortage of new things to say about the State of the Union.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_005.wav|The very key to our success has been our ability for most among nations to preserve our lasting values by making change work for us rather than against us.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_006.wav|I would like to talk with you this evening about what we can do together, not as Republicans and Democrats, but as Americans, to make tomorrow's America happy and prosperous at home strong and respected abroad and at peace in the world.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_007.wav|As we gather here tonight, the state of our union is strong, but our economy is troubled.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_008.wav|For too many of our fellow citizens, farmers, steel and auto workers, lumbermen, black teenagers, working mothers, this is a painful period.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_009.wav|We must all do everything in our power to bring their ordeal to an end.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_010.wav|It has fallen to us in our time to one due damage that was a long time in the making and to begin the hard but necessary task of building a better future for ourselves and our children.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_011.wav|We have a long way to go.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_012.wav|But thanks to the courage, patience and strength of our people, America is on the mend.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_013.wav|It involves many members of this body.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_014.wav|Just 10 days ago, after months of debate and deadlock, the bipartisan commission on social security accomplished the seemingly impossible.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_015.wav|Social security, as some of us had warned for so long, faced disaster.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_016.wav|I myself have been talking about this problem for almost 30 years.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_017.wav|As 1983 began, the system stood in the brink of bankruptcy, a double victim of our economic ideals.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_018.wav|First, a decade of rampant inflation drained its reserves as we tried to protect beneficiaries from the spiraling cost of living.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_019.wav|Then the recession and the sudden end of inflation, whether the expanding wage-based and increasing revenues the system needs to support the 36 million Americans who depend on it.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_020.wav|When the speaker of the House, the Senate Majority Leader and I performed the bipartisan, the bipartisan commission on social security, pundits and experts predicted that party divisions and conflicting interests would prevent the commission from agreeing on a plan to save social security.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_021.wav|Well, sometimes, even here in Washington, the cynics are wrong.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_022.wav|Through compromise and cooperation, the members of the commission overcame their differences and achieved a fair, workable plan.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_023.wav|They prove that when it comes to the national welfare, Americans can still pull together for the common good.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_024.wav|I'm especially pleased to join with the speaker and the Senate Majority Leader in urging the Congress to enact this plan by Easter.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_025.wav|There are elements in it, of course, that none of us prefers, but taken together, it performs a package that all of us can support.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_026.wav|It asks for some sacrifice by all the self-employed, beneficiaries, workers, government employees, and the better off among the retired.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_027.wav|But it imposes an undue burden on none.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_028.wav|And in supporting it, we keep an important pledge to the American people.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_029.wav|The integrity of the social security system will be preserved, and no one's payments will be reduced.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_030.wav|The commission's plan will do the job.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_031.wav|Indeed, it must do the job.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_032.wav|We owe it to today's older Americans and today's younger workers.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_033.wav|So before we go any further, I ask you to join with me in saluting the members of the commission who are here tonight and Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker and Speaker Tip O'Neill for a job will inspire all of us as we face the challenges of the year ahead.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_034.wav|Nearly half a century ago, in this chamber, another American president Franklin Deuton Roosevelt, in his second state of the Union message urged America to look to the future, to meet the challenge of change and the need for leadership that looks forward, not backward.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_035.wav|Throughout the world, he said, change is the order of the day.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_036.wav|In every nation, economic problems long in the making have brought crises to many kinds for which the masters of old practice and theory were unprepared.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_037.wav|He also reminded us that the future lies with those wise political leaders who realize that the great public is interested more in government than in politics.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_038.wav|So let us in these next two years, men and women of both parties, every political shade, concentrate on the long range, bipartisan responsibilities of government, not the short range or short term temptations of partisan politics.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_039.wav|The problems we inherited were far worse than most inside and out of government had expected.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_040.wav|The recession was deeper than most inside and out of government had predicted.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_041.wav|Curing those problems has taken more time and a higher toll than any of us wanted.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_042.wav|Unemployment is far too high.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_043.wav|Projected federal spending, if government refuses to tighten its own belt, will also be far too high and could weaken and shorten the economic recovery now underway.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_044.wav|This recovery will bring with it a revival of economic confidence and spending for consumer items and capital goods the stimulus we need to restart our stalled economic engines.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_045.wav|The American people have already stepped up their rate of saving, assuring that the funds needed to modernize our factories and improve our technology will once again flow to business and industry.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_046.wav|The inflationary expectations that led to a 21.5 percent interest prime rate and so-soaring mortgage rates two years ago are now reduced by almost half.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_047.wav|Leaders have started to realize that double-digit inflation is no longer a way of life.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_048.wav|I misspoke there I should have said lenders, so interest rates have tumbled, paving the way for recovery in vital industries like housing and autos.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_049.wav|The early evidence of that recovery has started coming in.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_050.wav|Housing starts for the fourth quarter of 1982 were up 45 percent from a year ago and housing permits a sure indicator of future growth were up a whopping 60 percent.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_051.wav|We're witnessing an upsurge of productivity and impressive evidence that American industry will once again become competitive in markets at home and abroad, ensuring more jobs and better incomes for the nation's workforce.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_052.wav|But our confidence must also be tempered by realism and patience.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_053.wav|Quick fixes and artificial stimulants repeatedly applied over decades are what brought us the inflationary disorders that we've now paid such a heavy price to cure.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_054.wav|The permanent recovery and employment, production and investment we seek won't come in a sharp short spur.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_055.wav|It'll build carefully, insteadly in the months and years ahead.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_056.wav|In the meantime, the challenge of government is to identify the things that we can do now to ease the massive economic transition for the American people.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_057.wav|The federal budget is both a symptom and a cause of our economic problems.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_058.wav|Unless we reduce the dangerous growth rate in government spending, we could face the progress or prospect of sluggish economic growth into the indefinite future.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_059.wav|Failure to cope with this problem now could mean as much as a trillion dollars more in national debt in the next four years alone.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_060.wav|That would average $4,300 in additional debt for every man, woman, child and baby in our nation.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_061.wav|To assure and sustain recovery, we must continue getting runaway spending under control to bring those deficits down.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_062.wav|If we don't, the recovery will be too short.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_063.wav|Unemployment will remain too high and we will leave an unconscionable burden of national debt for our children.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_064.wav|That we must not do.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_065.wav|Let's be clear about where the deficit problem comes from.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_066.wav|Contrary to the drumbeat we've been hearing for the last few months, the deficits we face are not rooted in defense spending.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_067.wav|Taken as a percentage of the gross national product, our defense spending happens to be only about four-fifths of what it was in 1970.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_068.wav|Nor is the deficit as some would have it rooted in tax cuts.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_069.wav|Even with our tax cuts, taxes as a fraction of gross national product remained about the same as they were in 1970.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_070.wav|The fact is our deficits come from the uncontrolled growth of the budget for domestic spending.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_071.wav|During the 1970s, the share of our national income devoted to this domestic spending increased by more than 60 percent, from ten cents out of every dollar produced by the American people to sixteen cents.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_072.wav|In spite of all our economies and efficiencies, and without adding any new programs, basic necessary domestic spending provided for in this year's budget will grow to almost a trillion dollars over the next five years.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_073.wav|The deficit problem is a clear and present danger to the basic health of our republic.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_074.wav|We need a plan to overcome this danger, a plan based on these principles.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_075.wav|It must be bipartisan.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_076.wav|Concoring the deficits and putting the government's house in order will require the best efforts of all of us.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_077.wav|It must be fair.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_078.wav|Just as all will share in the benefits that will come from recovery, all would share fairly in the burden of transition.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_079.wav|It must be prudent.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_080.wav|The strength of our national defense must be restored so that we can pursue prosperity and peace and freedom while maintaining our commitment to the truly needy.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_081.wav|And finally, it must be realistic.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_082.wav|We can't rely on hope alone.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_083.wav|With these guiding principles in mind, let me outline a four-part plan to increase economic growth and reduce deficits.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_084.wav|First, in my budget message, I will recommend a federal spending freeze.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_085.wav|I know there's a strong medicine, but so far we have only cut the rate of increase in federal spending.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_086.wav|The government has continued to spend more money each year, though not as much more as it did in the past.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_087.wav|Taken as a whole, the budget I'm producing or proposing for the next fiscal year will increase no more than the rate of inflation.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_088.wav|In other words, the federal government will hold the line on real spending.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_089.wav|That's far less than many American families have had to do in these difficult times.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_090.wav|Social Security Commission be applied to other government-related retirement programs.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_091.wav|I will also propose a one-year freeze on a broad range of domestic spending programs and for federal civilian and military pay and pension programs.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_092.wav|And let me say right here, I'm sorry with regard to the military in asking that of them because for so many years, they have been so far behind and so low in reward for what the men and women in uniform are doing, but I'm sure they will understand that this must be across the board and fair.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_093.wav|Second, I will ask the Congress to adopt specific measures to control the growth of the so-called uncontrollable spending programs.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_094.wav|These are the automatic spending programs, such as food stamps, that cannot be simply frozen and that have grown by over 400 percent since 1970.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_095.wav|They are the largest single cause of the built-in or structural deficit problem.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_096.wav|Our standard here will be fairness.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_097.wav|Ensuring that the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars go only to the truly needy, that none of them are turned away, but that fraud and waste are stamped out.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_098.wav|And I'm sorry to say there's a lot of it out there.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_099.wav|In the food stamp program in the home last year, we identified almost 1.1 billion in overpayments.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_100.wav|The taxpayers aren't the only victims of this kind of abuse.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_101.wav|The truly needy suffer, as funds intended for them are taken not by the needy, but by the greedy.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_102.wav|For everyone's sake, we must put an end to such waste and corruption.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_103.wav|Third, I will adjust our program to restore America's defenses by proposing $55 billion in defense savings over the next five years.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_104.wav|These are savings recommended to me by the Secretary of Defense, who has assured me they can be safely achieved and will not diminish our ability to negotiate arms reductions or endanger America's security.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_105.wav|We will not gamble with our national survival.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_106.wav|Because we must ensure reduction and eventual elimination of deficits over the next several years, I will propose a stand-by tax limited to no more than 1 percent of the gross national product to start in fiscal 1986.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_107.wav|It would last no more than three years, and it would start only if the Congress has first approved our spending freeze and budget control program, and there are several other conditions also that must be met, all of them in order for this program to be triggered.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_108.wav|Now, you could say that this is an insurance policy for the future, a remedy that will be at hand if needed, but only resorted to if absolutely necessary.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_109.wav|In the meantime, we'll continue to study ways to simplify the tax code and make it more fair for all Americans.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_110.wav|This is a goal that every American who has ever struggled with a tax form can understand.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_111.wav|At the same time, however, I will oppose any efforts to one do the basic tax reforms that we've already enacted, including the 10 percent tax break coming to taxpayers this July, but the looming deficits that hang over us and over America's future must be reduced.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_112.wav|The path I've outlined is fair, balanced, and realistic.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_113.wav|If enacted, it will ensure a steady decline in deficits aiming toward a balanced budget by the end of the decade.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_114.wav|It's the only path that will lead to a strong sustained recovery.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_115.wav|Let us follow that path together.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_116.wav|No domestic challenge is more crucial than providing stable, permanent jobs for all Americans who want to work.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_117.wav|The recovery program will provide jobs for most, but others will need special help and training for new skills.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_118.wav|Shortly, I will submit to the Congress the Employment Act of 1983, designed to get at the special problems of the long-term unemployed as well as young people trying to enter the job market.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_119.wav|I'll propose extending unemployment benefits, including special incentives to employers who hire the long-term unemployed, providing programs for displaced workers and helping federally funded and state administered unemployment insurance programs, provide workers with training and relocation assistance.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_120.wav|Finally, our proposal will include new incentives for summer youth employment to help young people get a start in the job market.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_121.wav|We must offer both short-term help and long-term hope for our unemployed.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_122.wav|Regulatory reform legislation, a responsible clean air act and passage of enterprise-zone legislation will also create new incentives for jobs and opportunity.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_123.wav|One out of every five jobs in our country depends on trade, so I will propose a broader strategy in the field of international trade.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_124.wav|One that increases the openness of our trading system and is fairer to America's farmers and workers in the world marketplace.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_125.wav|We must have adequate export financing to South American products overseas.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_126.wav|I will ask for new negotiating authority to remove barriers and to get more of our products into foreign markets.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_127.wav|We must strengthen the organization of our trade agencies and make changes in our domestic laws and international trade policy to promote free trade and the increased flow of American goods, services and investments.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_128.wav|Our trade position can also be improved by making our ports system more efficient.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_129.wav|Better, more active harbors translate into stable jobs in our coal fields, railroads, trucking industry and ports.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_130.wav|After two years of debate, it's time for us to get together and enact training and retraining are fundamental to our successes, our research and development and productivity, labor, management and government at all levels can and must participate in improving these tools of growth.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_131.wav|Tax policy, regulatory practices and government programs all need constant re-evaluation in terms of our competitiveness.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_132.wav|Every American has a role and a stake in international trade.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_133.wav|We Americans are still the technological leaders in most fields.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_134.wav|We must keep that edge and to do so we need to begin renewing the basics, starting with our educational system.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_135.wav|While we grew a complacent others have acted.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_136.wav|Japan with a population only about half the size of ours graduates from its universities more engineers than we do.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_137.wav|If a child doesn't receive adequate math and science teaching by the age of 16 he or she has lost the chance to be a scientist or an engineer.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_138.wav|We must join together parents, teachers, grassroots groups, organized labor and the business community to revitalize American education by setting a standard of excellence.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_139.wav|In 1983 we seek four major education goals.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_140.wav|A quality education initiative to encourage a substantial upgrading of math and science instruction through block grants to the states.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_141.wav|Establishment of education savings accounts that will give middle and lower income families an incentive to save for their children's college education and at the same time encourage a real increase in savings for economic growth.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_142.wav|Passage of tuition tax credits for parents who want to send their children to private or religiously affiliated schools.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_143.wav|A constitutional amendment and eliminate once and for all all traces of unjust discrimination against women from the United States code.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_144.wav|We will not tolerate wage discrimination based on sex and we intend to strengthen enforcement of child support laws to ensure that single parents most of whom are women do not suffer unfair financial hardship.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_145.wav|We will also take action to remedy inequities and pensions.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_146.wav|These initiatives will be joined by others to continue our efforts to promote equity for women.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_147.wav|We will ask for extension of the Civil Rights Commission which is due to expire this year.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_148.wav|The commission is an important part of the ongoing struggle for justice in America and we strongly support its reauthorization.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_149.wav|Effective enforcement of our nation's fair housing laws is also essential to ensuring equal opportunity.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_150.wav|In the year ahead we will work to strengthen enforcement of fair housing laws for all Americans.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_151.wav|The time has also come for major reform of our criminal justice statutes and acceleration of the drive against organized crime and drug trafficking.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_152.wav|It's high time that we make our cities safe again.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_153.wav|This administration hereby declares an all-out war on big-time organized crime and the drug racketeers who are poisoning our young people.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_154.wav|We will also implement recommendations of our task force on victims of crime which will report to me this week.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_155.wav|American agriculture, the envy of the world has become the victim of its own successes.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_156.wav|With one farmer now producing enough food to feed himself and 77 other people, America is confronted with record surplus crops and commodity prices below the cost of production.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_157.wav|We must strive through innovations like the payment in kind crop swap approach and an aggressive export policy to restore health and vitality to rural America.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_158.wav|Meanwhile, I have instructed the Department of Agriculture to work individually with farmers with debt problems, has successfully forged a working partnership involving leaders of business, labor, education and government to address the training needs of American workers.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_159.wav|Thanks to the task force, private sector initiatives are now underway in all 50 states of the union and thousands of working people have been helped in making the shift from dead-end jobs and low-demand skills to the growth areas of high technology in the service economy.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_160.wav|Additionally, a major effort will be focused on encouraging the expansion of private community childcare.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_161.wav|The new advisory council on private sector initiatives will carry on and extend this vital work of encouraging private initiative in 1983.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_162.wav|In the coming year, we will also act to improve the quality of life for Americans by curbing the skyrocketing cost of health care that is becoming an unbearable financial burden for so many.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_163.wav|And we will submit legislation to provide catastrophic illness insurance coverage for older Americans.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_164.wav|Federalism proposal that will continue our efforts to restore to states and local governments their roles as dynamic laboratories of change in a creative society.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_165.wav|During the next several weeks, I will send to the Congress a series of detailed proposals on these and other topics and look forward to working with you on the development of these initiatives.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_166.wav|So far, now I've concentrated mainly on the problems posed by the future.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_167.wav|But in almost every home and workplace in America, we're already witnessing reason for great hope.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_168.wav|The first flowering of the man-made miracles of high technology, a field pioneered and still led by our country.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_169.wav|To many of us now, computers, silicon chips, data processing, cybernetics, and all the other innovations of the dawning high technology age are as mystifying as the workings of the combustion engine must have been when that first model T rattled down Main Street USA.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_170.wav|But as surely as America's pioneer spirit made us the industrial giant of the 20th century, the same pioneer spirit today is opening up in another vast front of opportunity, the frontier of high technology.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_171.wav|In conquering the frontier, we cannot write off our traditional industries.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_172.wav|But we must develop the skills and industries that will make us a pioneer of tomorrow.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_173.wav|This administration is committed to keeping America the technological leader of the world now and into the 21st century.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_174.wav|America's leadership in the world came to us because of our own strength and because of the values which guide us as a society.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_175.wav|Free elections, a free press, freedom of religious choice, free trade unions, and above all, freedom for the individual and rejection of the arbitrary power of the state.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_176.wav|These values are the bedrock of our strength.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_177.wav|They unite us in a stewardship of peace and freedom with our allies and friends in NATO, in Asia, in Latin America, and elsewhere.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_178.wav|They are also the values which in the recent past, some among us had begun to doubt and view with a cynical eye.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_179.wav|Fortunately, we and our allies have rediscovered the strength of our common democratic values and were applying them as a cornerstone of a comprehensive strategy for peace with freedom.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_180.wav|In London last year, I announced the commitment of the United States to developing the infrastructure of democracy throughout the world.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_181.wav|We intend to pursue this democratic initiative vigorously.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_182.wav|The future belongs not to governments and ideologies which oppress their peoples, but to democratic systems of self-government which encourage individual initiative and guarantee personal freedom.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_183.wav|Economic strength and military strength.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_184.wav|A strong American economy is essential to the well-being and security of our friends and allies.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_185.wav|The restoration of a strong, healthy American economy has been and remains one of the central pillars of our foreign policy.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_186.wav|The progress I've been able to report to you tonight will I know be as warmly welcomed by the rest of the world as it is by the American people.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_187.wav|We must also recognize that our own economic well-being is inextricably linked to the world economy.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_188.wav|We export over 20 percent of our industrial production and 40 percent of our farmland produces for export.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_189.wav|We will continue to work closely with the industrialized democracies of Europe and Japan and with the international monetary funds to ensure it has adequate resources to help bring the world economy back to strong non-inflationary growth.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_190.wav|As the leader of the West and as a country that has become great and rich because of economic freedom, America must be an unrelenting advocate of free trade.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_191.wav|As some nations are tempted to turn to protectionism, our strategy cannot be to follow them but to lead the way toward free or trade.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_192.wav|To this end, in May of this year America will host an economic summit meeting in Williamsburg, Virginia.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_193.wav|As we begin our third year, we have put in place a defense program that redeems the neglect of the past decade.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_194.wav|We have developed a realistic military strategy to deter threats to peace and to protect freedom if deterrence fails.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_195.wav|Our armed forces are finally properly paid.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_196.wav|After years of neglect, are well-trained and becoming better equipped and supplied.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_197.wav|And the American uniform is once again worn with pride and we will be addressing one key system, the MX missile in consultation with the Congress in a few months.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_198.wav|America's foreign policy is once again based on bipartisanship, on realism, strength, full partnership, and consultation with our allies, and constructive negotiation with potential adversaries.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_199.wav|From the Middle East to southern Africa to Geneva, American diplomats are taking the initiative to make peace and lower arms levels.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_200.wav|We should be proud of our role as peacemakers.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_201.wav|In the Middle East last year, the United States played the major role in ending the tragic fighting in Lebanon and negotiated the withdrawal of the PLO from Beirut.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_202.wav|Last September, I outlined principles to carry on the peace process, begun so promisingly at Camp David, all the people of the Middle East should know that in the year ahead, we will not flag in our efforts to build on that foundation, to bring them the blessings of peace.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_203.wav|Final passage of the remaining portions of our Caribbean Basin initiative, which passed the House last year, is one of this administration's top legislative priorities for 1983.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_204.wav|The security and economic assistance policies of this administration in Latin America and elsewhere are based on realism and represent a critical investment in the future of the human race.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_205.wav|This undertaking is a joint responsibility of the executive and legislative branches, and I'm counting on the cooperation and statesmanship of the Congress to help us meet this essential foreign policy goal.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_206.wav|At the heart of our strategy for peace is our relationship with the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_207.wav|The past year saw a change in Soviet leadership.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_208.wav|We're prepared for a positive change in Soviet American relations, but the Soviet Union must show by deeds as well as words, a sincere commitment.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_209.wav|For our part, we're vigorously pursuing arms reduction negotiations with the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_210.wav|Supported by our allies, we put forward draft agreements proposing significant weapon reductions to equal and verifiable lower levels.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_211.wav|We insist on an equal balance of forces, and given the overwhelming evidence of Soviet violations of international treaties concerning chemical and biological weapons of land-based missiles, we are also prepared to carefully explore serious Soviet proposals.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_212.wav|At the same time, let me emphasize that allied steadfastness remains a key to achieving arms reductions.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_213.wav|With firmness and dedication, we'll continue to negotiate.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_214.wav|Deep down, the Soviets must know it's in their interest as well as ours to prevent a wasteful arms race, and once they recognize our unshakeable resolve to maintain adequate deterrence, they will have every reason to join us in the search for greater security and major arms reductions.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_215.wav|When that moment comes, and I'm confident that it will, we would have taken an important step toward a more peaceful future for all the world's people.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_216.wav|Once said that America has never forgotten the nobler things that brought her into being and that light her path.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_217.wav|Our country is a special place because we Americans have always been sustained through good times and bad by a noble vision.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_218.wav|A vision not only of what the world around us is today, but what we as a free people can make it be tomorrow.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_219.wav|We're realists.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_220.wav|We solve our problems instead of ignoring them, no matter how loud the chorus of despair around us.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_221.wav|But we're also idealists, for it was an ideal that brought our ancestors to these shores from every corner of the world.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_222.wav|Right now we need both realism and idealism.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_223.wav|Millions of our neighbors are without work.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_224.wav|It is up to us to see they aren't without hope.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_225.wav|This is a task for all of us, and may I say Americans have rallied to this cause, proving once again that we are the most generous people on earth.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_226.wav|We who are in government.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_227.wav|Right now with inflation as low as it is, 3.9 percent, there is room for interest rates to come down, prevents their reduction.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_228.wav|A lender, as we know, was charging interest rate that recovers the depreciated value of the dollar's loan.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_229.wav|And that depreciation is, of course, the amount of inflation.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_230.wav|Today, interest rates are based on fear.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_231.wav|Fear that government will resort to measures as it has in the past that will send inflation zooming again.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_232.wav|We who serve here in this capital must erase that fear by making it absolutely clear that we will not stop fighting inflation, that together we will do only those things that will lead to lasting economic growth.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_233.wav|Yes, the problems confronting us are large and forbidding, and certainly no one can or should minimize the plight of millions of our friends and neighbors who are living in the bleak emptiness of unemployment.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_234.wav|But we must and can give them good reason to be hopeful.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_235.wav|Back over the years, citizens like ourselves have gathered within these walls when our nation was threatened.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_236.wav|Sometimes when its very existence was at stake, always with courage and common sense, they met the crises of their time and lived to see a stronger, better, and more prosperous country.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_237.wav|The present situation is no worse and in fact is not as bad as some of those they faced.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_238.wav|Time and again, they prove that there is nothing.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_239.wav|We Americans cannot achieve as free men and women.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_240.wav|Yes, we still have problems plenty of them.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_241.wav|But it's just plain wrong, unjust to our country and unjust to our people to let those problems stand in the way of the most important truth of all.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_242.wav|We owe it to the unfortunate to be aware of their plight and to help them in every way we can.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_243.wav|No one can quarrel with that.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_244.wav|We must and do have compassion for all the victims of this economic crisis.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_245.wav|But the big story about America today is the way that millions of confident caring people, those extraordinary, ordinary Americans who never make the headlines and will never be interviewed, are laying the foundation not just for recovery from our present problems, but for a better tomorrow for all our people.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_246.wav|From coast to coast, on the job and in classrooms and laboratories of new construction sites and in churches and community groups, neighbors are helping neighbors.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_247.wav|And they've already begun the building, the research, the work, and the giving that will make our country great again.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_248.wav|I believe this because I believe in them, in the strength of their hearts and minds, in the commitment that each one of them brings to their daily lives be they higher humble.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_249.wav|A challenge for us in government is to be worthy of them, to make government a help, not a hindrance to our people and the challenging but promising days ahead.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_250.wav|If we do that, if we care what our children and our children's children will say of us, if we want them one day to be thankful for what we did here in these temples of freedom, we will work together to make America better for our having been here, not just in this year or this next day or this decade, but in the next century and beyond.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_001.wav|good evening.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_002.wav|Usually I talk with you from my office in the west wing of the white house, but tonight there's something special to talk about, and I've asked someone very special to join me.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_003.wav|Nancy and I are here in the west hall of the white house and around us are the rooms in which we live.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_004.wav|It's the home you've provided for us, of which we merely have temporary custody.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_005.wav|Nancy's joining me because the message this evening is not my message, but ours.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_006.wav|And we speak to you not simply as fellow citizens, but as fellow parents and grandparents and as concerned neighbors.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_007.wav|It's back to school time for America's children, and while drug and alcohol abuse cuts across all generations, it's especially damaging to the young people on whom our future depends.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_008.wav|So tonight, from our family to yours, from our home to yours.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_009.wav|Thank you for joining us.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_010.wav|America has accomplished so much in these last few years, whether it's been rebuilding our economy or serving the cause of freedom in the world, what we've been able to achieve has been done with your help.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_011.wav|With us working together as a nation united.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_012.wav|Now we need your support again.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_013.wav|Drugs are menacing our society.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_014.wav|They're threatening our values and undercutting our institutions.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_015.wav|They're killing our children.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_016.wav|From the beginning of our administration, we've taken strong steps to do something about this horror.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_017.wav|Tonight, I can report to you that we've made much progress.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_018.wav|37 federal agencies are working together in a vigorous national effort.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_019.wav|And by next year, our spending for drug law enforcement will have more than tripled from its 1981 levels.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_020.wav|We have increased seizures of illegal drugs.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_021.wav|Shortages of marijuana are now being reported.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_022.wav|Last year alone, over 10,000 drug criminals were convicted, and nearly 250 million dollars of their assets were seized by the DEA, the Drug Enforcement Administration.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_023.wav|And in the most important area, individual use, we see progress.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_024.wav|In four years, the number of high school seniors using marijuana on a daily basis has dropped from one in 14 to one in 20.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_025.wav|The U.S. military has cut the use of illegal drugs among its personnel by 67 percent since 1980.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_026.wav|These are a measure of our commitment and emerging signs that we can defeat this enemy.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_027.wav|But we still have much to do.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_028.wav|Despite our best efforts, illegal cocaine is coming into our country at alarming levels, and four to five million people regularly use it.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_029.wav|Five hundred thousand Americans are hooked on heroin.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_030.wav|One in 12 persons spoke marijuana regularly.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_031.wav|Regular drug use is even higher among the age group 18 to 25, most likely just entering the workforce.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_032.wav|Today, there's a new epidemic.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_033.wav|Smokable cocaine, otherwise known as crack.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_034.wav|It is an explosively destructive and often lethal substance, which is crushing its users.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_035.wav|It is an uncontrolled fire.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_036.wav|And drug abuse is not a so-called victimless crime.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_037.wav|Everyone's safety is at stake when drugs in excessive alcohol are used by people on the highways or by those transporting our citizens or operating industrial equipment.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_038.wav|Drug abuse costs you and your federal Americans at least $60 billion a year.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_039.wav|From the early days of our administration, Nancy has been intensely involved in the effort to fight drug abuse.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_040.wav|She has since traveled over a hundred thousand miles to 55 cities in 28 states and 64 countries to fight school-aged drug and alcohol abuse.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_041.wav|She's given dozens of speeches and scores of interviews and has participated in 24 special radio and TV tapings to create greater awareness of this crisis.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_042.wav|Her personal observations and efforts have given her such dramatic insights that I wanted her to share them with you this evening.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_043.wav|Nancy?
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_044.wav|I think you can see why Nancy has been such a positive influence on all that we're trying to do.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_045.wav|The job ahead of us is very clear.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_046.wav|Nancy's personal crusade, like that of so many other wonderful individuals, should become our national crusade.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_047.wav|It must include a combination of government and private efforts which complement one another.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_048.wav|Last month, I announced six initiatives which we believe will do just that.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_049.wav|First, we seek a drug-free workplace at all levels of government and in the private sector.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_050.wav|Second, we'll work toward drug-free schools.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_051.wav|Third, we want to ensure that the public is protected and the treatment is available to substance abusers and the chemically dependent.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_052.wav|Our fourth goal is to expand international cooperation while treating drug trafficking as a threat to our national security.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_053.wav|In October, I will be meeting with key US ambassadors to discuss what can be done to support our friends abroad.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_054.wav|Fifth, we must move to strengthen law enforcement activities such as those initiated by Vice President Bush and Attorney General Mice.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_055.wav|And finally, we seek to expand public awareness and prevention.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_056.wav|In order to further implement these six goals, I will announce tomorrow a series of new proposals for a drug-free America.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_057.wav|Taken as a whole, these proposals will toughen our laws against drug criminals, encourage more research and treatment and ensure that illegal drugs will not be tolerated in our schools or in our workplaces.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_058.wav|Together with our ongoing efforts, these proposals will bring the federal commitment to fighting drugs to $3 billion.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_059.wav|As much financing as we commit, however, we would be fooling ourselves if we thought that massive new amounts of money alone will provide the solution.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_060.wav|Let us not forget that in America, people solve problems and no national crusade has ever succeeded without human investment.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_061.wav|Winning the crusade against drugs will not be achieved by just throwing money at the problem.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_062.wav|Your government will continue to act aggressively, but nothing would be more effective than for Americans simply to quit using illegal drugs.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_063.wav|We seek to create a massive change in national attitudes which ultimately will separate the drugs from the customer, to take the user away from the supply.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_064.wav|I believe quite simply that we can help them quit, and that's where you come in.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_065.wav|My generation will remember how America swung into action when we were attacked in World War II.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_066.wav|The war was not just fought by the women alike, building planes and ships, clothing sailors and soldiers, feeding Marines and airmen, and it was fought by children planting victory gardens and collecting cans.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_067.wav|Well, now we're in another war for our freedom, and it's time for all of us to pull together again.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_068.wav|So, for example, if your friend or neighbor or a family member has a drug or alcohol problem, don't turn the other way.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_069.wav|Go to his help or to hers.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_070.wav|Get others involved with you, clubs, service groups and community organizations, and provide support and strength.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_071.wav|And of course, many of you have been cured through treatment and self-help.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_072.wav|Well, you're the combat veterans, and you have a critical role to play.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_073.wav|You can help others by telling your story and providing a willing hand to those in need.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_074.wav|Being friends to others is the best way of being friends to ourselves.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_075.wav|It's time, as Nancy said, for America to just say no to drugs.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_076.wav|Those of you in union halls and workplaces everywhere, please make this challenge a part of your job every day.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_077.wav|Help us preserve the health and dignity of all workers.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_078.wav|To business as large and small, we need the creativity of your enterprise, applied directly to this national problem.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_079.wav|Help us.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_080.wav|And those of you who are educators, your wisdom and leadership are indispensable to this cause.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_081.wav|From the pulpits of this spirit-filled land, we would welcome your reassuring message of redemption and forgiveness and of helping one another.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_082.wav|On the athletic fields, you men and women are among the most beloved citizens of our country.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_083.wav|A child's eyes fill with your heroic achievements.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_084.wav|Few of us can give youngsters something as special and strong to look up to as you.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_085.wav|Please don't let them down.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_086.wav|And this camera in front of us, it's a reminder that in Nancy's and my former profession and in the newsrooms and production rooms of our media centers, you have a special opportunity with your enormous influence to send alarm signals across the nation.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_087.wav|To our friends in foreign countries, we know many of you were involved in this battle with us.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_088.wav|We need your success as well as ours.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_089.wav|When we all come together, united, striving for this cause, then those who are killing America and terrorizing it with slow but sure chemical destruction, we'll see that they are up against the mightiest force for good that we know.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_090.wav|Then they will have no dark alleyways to hide in.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_091.wav|In this crusade, let us not forget who we are.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_092.wav|Drug abuse is a repudiation of everything America is.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_093.wav|The destructiveness and human wreckage mock our heritage.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_094.wav|Think for a moment how special it is to be an American.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_095.wav|Can we doubt that only a divine providence place this land?
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_096.wav|This island of freedom here is a refuge for all those people in the world who yearn to breathe free.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_097.wav|The revolution out of which our liberty was conceived signaled an historical call to an entire world seeking hope.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_098.wav|Each new arrival of immigrants rode the crest of that hope.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_099.wav|They came millions seeking a safe harbor from the oppression of cruel regimes.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_100.wav|They came to escape starvation and disease.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_101.wav|They came those surviving the Holocaust and the Soviet Goulegs.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_102.wav|They came the boat people, chancing death for even a glimmer of hope that they could have a new life.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_103.wav|They all came to taste the air, redel it and rich with the freedom that is ours.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_104.wav|What an insult it will be to what we are and once we came, if we do not rise up together in defiance against this cancer of drugs.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_105.wav|And there's one more thing.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_106.wav|The freedom that so many seek in our land has not been preserved without a price.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_107.wav|Nancy and I shared that remembrance two years ago at the Normandy American Cemetery in France.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_108.wav|In the still of that June afternoon, we walked together among the soldiers of freedom, past the hundreds of white markers which are monuments to courage and memorials to sacrifice.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_109.wav|Too many of these and other such graves are the final resting places of teenagers who became men in the roar of battle.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_110.wav|Look what they gave to us who lived.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_111.wav|Never would they see another sunlit day glistening off a lake or river back home or a miles of corn pushing up against the open sky of our plains.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_112.wav|The pristine air of our mountains and the driving energy of our cities are there is no more nor would they ever again be a son to their parents or a father to their own children.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_113.wav|They did this for you, for me, for a new generation to carry our democratic experiment proudly forward.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_114.wav|Well that's something I think we're obliged to honor because what they did for us means that we owe as a simple act of civic stewardship to use our freedom wisely for the common good.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_115.wav|As we mobilize for this national crusade, I'm mindful that drugs are a constant temptation for millions.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_116.wav|Please remember this when your courage is tested.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_117.wav|You are Americans.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_118.wav|You're the product of the freest society mankind has ever known.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_119.wav|No one ever has the right to destroy your dreams and shatter your life.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_120.wav|Write down the end of this hall as the Lincoln bedroom.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_121.wav|But in the Civil War that room was the one president Lincoln used as his office.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_122.wav|Memory fills that room and more than anything that memory drives us to see vividly what President Lincoln sought to save.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_123.wav|Above all, it is that America must stand for something and that our heritage lets us stand with a strength of character made more steely by each layer of challenge pressed upon the nation.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_124.wav|We Americans have never been morally neutral against any form of tyranny.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_125.wav|Tonight we're asking no more than that we honor what we have been and what we are by standing together.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_126.wav|God bless you and good night.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_001.wav|I fell Americans, this is the 34th time I'll speak to you from the Oval Office and the last.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_002.wav|We've been together eight years now and soon it'll be time for me to go.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_003.wav|But before I do, I wanted to share some thoughts, some of which I've been saving for a long time.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_004.wav|It's been the honor of my life to be your president.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_005.wav|So many of you have written the past few weeks to say thanks, but I could say as much to you, Nancy and I are grateful for the opportunity you gave us to serve.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_006.wav|One of the things about the presidency is that you're always somewhat apart.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_007.wav|You spend a lot of time going by too fast in a car, someone else is driving and seeing the people through tinted glass, the parents holding up a child and the wave you saw too late and couldn't return and so many times I wanted to stop and reach out from behind the glass and connect.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_008.wav|Well, maybe I can do a little of that tonight.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_009.wav|People ask how I feel about leaving and the fact is parting is such sweet sorrow.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_010.wav|The sweet part is California and the ranch and freedom.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_011.wav|The sorrow, the good buys of course and leaving this beautiful place.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_012.wav|You know down the hall and up the stairs from this office is the part of the White House where the president and his family live.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_013.wav|There are a few favorite windows I have up there that I like to stand and look out of early in the morning.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_014.wav|The view is over the grounds here to the Washington Monument and then the Mall and the Jefferson Memorial.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_015.wav|But on mornings when the humidity is low, you can see past the Jefferson to the river, the Potomac and the Virginia Shore.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_016.wav|Someone said that's the view Lincoln had when he saw the smoke rising from the Battle of Bull Run.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_017.wav|Well, I see more prosaic things.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_018.wav|The grass on the banks, the morning traffic as people make their way to work, now and then a sailboat on the river.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_019.wav|I've been thinking a bit at that window.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_020.wav|I've been reflecting on what the past eight years have meant and mean.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_021.wav|And the image that comes to mind like a refrain is an article one.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_022.wav|A small story about a big ship and a refugee and a sailor.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_023.wav|It was back in the early eighties at the height of the boat people.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_024.wav|And the sailor was hard at work on the carrier midway, which was patrolling the South China Sea.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_025.wav|The sailor like most American servicemen was young, smart and fiercely observant.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_026.wav|The crew spied on the horizon a leaky little boat and crammed inside were refugees from Indochina hoping to get to America.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_027.wav|The midway sent a small launch to bring them to the ship and safety.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_028.wav|As the refugees made their way through the choppy seas, one spied the sailor on deck and stood up and called out to him.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_029.wav|He yelled, hello, American sailor, hello, freedom man.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_030.wav|A small moment with a big meeting, a moment the sailor who wrote it in the letter couldn't get out of his mind.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_031.wav|And when I saw it, neither could I.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_032.wav|Because that's what it has to be in America in the 1980s.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_033.wav|We stood again for freedom.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_034.wav|I know we always have, but in the past few years, the world again and in a way we ourselves rediscovered it.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_035.wav|It's been quite a journey this decade and we held together through some stormy seas.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_036.wav|And at the end, together we're reaching our destination.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_037.wav|The fact is from Grenada to the Washington and Moscow summits, from the recession of 81 to 82, to the expansion that began in late 82 and continues to this day, we've made a difference.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_038.wav|The way I see it, there were two great triumphs, two things that I'm proud of stuff.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_039.wav|One is the economic recovery in which the people of America created and filled 19 million new jobs.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_040.wav|The other is the recovery of our morale.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_041.wav|America is respected again in the world and looked to for leadership.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_042.wav|Something that happened to me a few years ago reflects some of this.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_043.wav|It was back in 1981 and I was attending my first big economic summit, which was held that year in Canada.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_044.wav|The meeting place rotates among the member countries.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_045.wav|The opening meeting was a formal dinner for the heads of government of the seven industrialized nations.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_046.wav|Well, I sat there like the new kid in school and listened and it was all Francois Visson, Helmut that.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_047.wav|They dropped titles and spoke to one another on a first name basis.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_048.wav|Well, at one point I sort of leaned in and said, my name's Ron.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_049.wav|But in that same year, we began the actions we felt would ignite an economic comeback, cut taxes and regulation, started to cut spending and soon the recovery began.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_050.wav|Two years later, another economic summit with pretty much the same cast.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_051.wav|At the big opening meeting, we all got together and all of a sudden and just for a moment.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_052.wav|I saw that everyone was just sitting there looking at me and then one of them broke the silence.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_053.wav|Tell us about the American miracle, he said.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_054.wav|Well, back in 1980, when I was running for president, it was all so different.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_055.wav|Some pundits said our programs would result in catastrophe.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_056.wav|Our views on foreign affairs would cause war.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_057.wav|Our plans for the economy would cause inflation to soar and bring about economic collapse.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_058.wav|I even remember one highly respected economist saying back in 1982 that the engines of economic growth have shut down here and they're likely to stay that way for years to come.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_059.wav|Well, he and the other opinion leaders were wrong.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_060.wav|The fact is what they called radical was really right.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_061.wav|What they called dangerous was just desperately needed.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_062.wav|And in all of that time, I want a nickname, the great communicator.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_063.wav|But I never thought it was my style or the words I used that made a difference.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_064.wav|It was the content.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_065.wav|I wasn't a great communicator, but I communicated great things.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_066.wav|And they didn't spring full bloom from my brow.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_067.wav|They came from the heart of a great nation.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_068.wav|From our experience, our wisdom, and our belief in the principles that have guided us for two centuries.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_069.wav|They called it the Reagan Revolution.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_070.wav|Well, I'll accept that.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_071.wav|But for me, it always seemed more like the great rediscovery, a rediscovery of our values and our common sense.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_072.wav|Common sense told us that when you put a big tax on something, the people will produce less of it.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_073.wav|So we cut the people's tax rates and the people produced more than ever before.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_074.wav|The economy, bloomed like a plant that had been cut back and could now grow quicker and stronger.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_075.wav|Our economic program brought about the longest peacetime expansion in our history.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_076.wav|Real family income up, the poverty rate down, entrepreneurship booming, and an explosion in research and new technology.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_077.wav|We're exporting more now than ever because American industry became more competitive.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_078.wav|And at the same time, we summoned the national will to knock down protectionist walls of broad instead of erecting them at home.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_079.wav|Common sense also told us that to preserve the peace, we'd have to become strong again after years of weakness and confusion.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_080.wav|So we rebuild our defenses.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_081.wav|In this new year, we toasted the new peacefulness around the globe.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_082.wav|Not only of the superpowers actually begun to reduce their stockpiles of nuclear weapons and hope for even more progress is bright.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_083.wav|But the regional conflicts that rack the globe are also beginning to cease.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_084.wav|The Persian Gulf is no longer a war zone.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_085.wav|The Soviets are leaving Afghanistan.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_086.wav|The Vietnamese are preparing to pull out of Cambodia.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_087.wav|And an American mediated accord will soon send 50,000 Cuban troops home from Angola.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_088.wav|The lesson of all this was, of course, that because we're a great nation, our challenges seem complex.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_089.wav|It will always be this way.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_090.wav|But as long as we remember our first principles and believe in ourselves, the future will always be ours.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_091.wav|And something else we learned.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_092.wav|Once you begin a great movement, there's no telling where to end.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_093.wav|We meant to change a nation.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_094.wav|And instead, we changed the world.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_095.wav|Countries across the globe are turning to free markets and free speech and turning away from the ideologies of the past.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_096.wav|For them, the great rediscovery of the 1980s has been that lo and behold, the moral way of government is the practical way of government.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_097.wav|Democracy, the profoundly good, is also the profoundly productive.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_098.wav|When you've got to the point where you can celebrate the anniversaries of your 39th birthday, you can sit back sometimes, review your life and see it flowing before you.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_099.wav|For me, there was a fork in the river, and it was right in the middle of my life.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_100.wav|I never meant to go into politics.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_101.wav|Wasn't my intention when I was young.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_102.wav|But I was raised to believe you had to pay your way for the blessings be stowed on you.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_103.wav|I was happy with my career in the entertainment world, but I ultimately went into politics because I wanted to protect something precious.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_104.wav|Hours was the first revolution in the history of mankind that truly reversed the course of government and with three little words.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_105.wav|We, the people.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_106.wav|We the people tell the government what to do.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_107.wav|It doesn't tell us.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_108.wav|We the people are the driver.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_109.wav|The government is the car and we decide where it should go and by what route and how fast.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_110.wav|Almost all the world's constitutions are documents in which governments tell the people what their privileges are.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_111.wav|Our constitution is a document in which we the people tell the government what it is allowed to do.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_112.wav|We the people are free.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_113.wav|This belief has been the underlying basis for everything I've tried to do these past eight years.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_114.wav|But back in the 1960s when I began, it seemed to me that we'd begun reversing the order of things.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_115.wav|That through more and more rules and regulations and confiscatory taxes, the government was taking more of our money, more of our options, and more of our freedom.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_116.wav|I went into politics in part to put up my hand and say stop.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_117.wav|I was a citizen politician and to seem the right thing for a citizen to do.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_118.wav|I think we have stopped a lot of what needed stopping.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_119.wav|And I hope we have once again reminded people that man is not free unless government is limited.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_120.wav|There's a clear cause and effect here that is as neat and predictable as a law of physics, as government expands liberty contracts.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_121.wav|Nothing is less free than pure communism.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_122.wav|And yet we have the past few years forged to satisfy new closeless with the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_123.wav|I've been asked if this isn't a gamble and my answer is no because we're basing our actions not on words but deeds.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_124.wav|The data of the 1970s was based not on actions but promises.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_125.wav|They'd promise to treat their own people and the people of the world better but the gulag was still the gulag and the state was still expansionist and they still waged proxy wars in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_126.wav|Well this time so far it's different.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_127.wav|President Gorbachev has brought about some internal democratic reforms and begun the withdrawal from Afghanistan.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_128.wav|He is also free prisoners whose names I've given him every time we've met.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_129.wav|But life has a way of reminding you of big things through small incidents.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_130.wav|Once during the heavy days of the Moscow Summit, Nancy and I decided to break off from the entourage one afternoon to visit the shops on Arbat Street.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_131.wav|That's a little street just off Moscow's main shopping area.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_132.wav|Even though our visit was a surprise every Russian there immediately recognized us and called out our names and reached for our hands.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_133.wav|We were just about swept away by the warmth.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_134.wav|You could almost feel the possibilities in all that joy.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_135.wav|But within seconds a KGB detail pushed their way toward us and began pushing and shoving the people in the crowd.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_136.wav|It was an interesting moment.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_137.wav|It reminded me that while a man on the street in the Soviet union yearns for peace, the government is communist and those who run it are communists and that means we and they view such issues as freedom and human rights very differently.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_138.wav|We must keep up our guard, but we must also continue to work together to lessen and eliminate tension and mistrust.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_139.wav|My view is that President Gorbachev is different from previous Soviet leaders.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_140.wav|I think he knows some of the things wrong with his society and is trying to fix them.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_141.wav|We wish him well and we'll continue to work to make sure that the Soviet Union that eventually emerges from this process is a less threatening one.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_142.wav|What it all boils down to is this.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_143.wav|I want the new closeness to continue and it will as long as we make it clear that we will continue to act in a certain way as long as they continue to act in a helpful manner.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_144.wav|If and when they don't, that first pull your punches if they persist, pull the plug.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_145.wav|It's still trust but verify.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_146.wav|It's still play but cut the cards.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_147.wav|It's still watch closely and don't be afraid to see what you see.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_148.wav|I've been asked if I have any regrets.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_149.wav|I do.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_150.wav|The deficit is one.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_151.wav|I've been talking a great deal about that lately, but tonight isn't for arguments and I'm going to hold my tongue.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_152.wav|But in observation, I've had my share of victories in the Congress, but what few people noticed is that I never won anything you didn't win for me.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_153.wav|They never saw my troops.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_154.wav|They never saw Reagan's regiments, the American people.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_155.wav|You won every battle with every call you made and letter you wrote demanding action.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_156.wav|Well, action is still needed.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_157.wav|If we're to finish the job of Reagan's regiments, we'll have to become the Bush brigades.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_158.wav|Soon he'll be the chief and he'll need you every bit as much as I did.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_159.wav|Finally, there is a great tradition of warnings in presidential farewells and I've got one that's been on my mind for some time.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_160.wav|But oddly enough, it starts with one of the things I'm proudest of in the past eight years.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_161.wav|The resurgence of national pride that I called the new patriotism.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_162.wav|This national feeling is good, but it won't come for much and it won't last unless it's grounded in thoughtfulness and knowledge.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_163.wav|An informed patriotism is what we want.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_164.wav|And are we doing a good enough job teaching our children what America is and what she represents in the long history of the world.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_165.wav|Those of us who were over 35 or so years of age grew up in a different America.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_166.wav|We were taught very directly what it means to be an American.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_167.wav|And we absorbed almost in the air, a love of country and an appreciation of its institutions.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_168.wav|If you didn't get these things from your family, you got them from the neighborhood, from the father down the street who fought in Korea, or the family who lost somewhat of an anzio, or you could get a sense of patriotism from school.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_169.wav|And if all else failed, you could get a sense of patriotism from the popular culture.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_170.wav|The movies celebrated democratic values and implicitly reinforced the idea that America was special.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_171.wav|TV was like that too through the mid-60s.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_172.wav|But now we're about to enter the 90s.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_173.wav|And some things have changed.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_174.wav|Younger parents aren't sure that an unambivalent appreciation of America is the right thing to teach modern children.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_175.wav|And as for those who create the popular culture, well-grounded patriotism is no longer the style.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_176.wav|Our spirit is back, but we haven't re-institutionalized it.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_177.wav|We've got to do a better job of getting across that America is freedom.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_178.wav|Freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of enterprise, and freedom is special and rare.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_179.wav|It's fragile.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_180.wav|It needs production.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_181.wav|So we've got to teach history based not on what's in fashion, but what's important.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_182.wav|Why the pilgrims came here?
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_183.wav|Who Jimmy Dildo was?
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_184.wav|And what those 30 seconds over Tokyo meant?
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_185.wav|You know, four years ago on the 40th anniversary of D-Day, I read a letter from a young woman writing to her late father who had fought on Omaha Beach.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_186.wav|Her name was Lisa Zanada Hen.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_187.wav|And she said, we will always remember, we will never forget what the boys of Normandy did.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_188.wav|Well, let's help her keep her word.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_189.wav|If we forget what we did, we won't know who we are.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_190.wav|I'm warning of an eradication of that, of the American memory that could result ultimately in an erosion of the American spirit.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_191.wav|Let's start with some basics.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_192.wav|More attention to American history and a greater emphasis on civic ritual.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_193.wav|And let me offer lesson number one about America.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_194.wav|All great change in America begins at the dinner table.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_195.wav|So tomorrow night in the kitchen, I hope the talking begins.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_196.wav|And children, if your parents haven't been teaching you what it means to be an American, let them know and nail them on it.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_197.wav|That would be a very American thing to do.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_198.wav|And that's about all I have to say tonight, except for one thing.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_199.wav|The fast few days when I've been at that window upstairs, I've thought a bit of the shining city upon a hill.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_200.wav|The phrase comes from John Winthrop, who wrote it to describe the America he imagined.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_201.wav|What he imagined was important because he was an early pilgrim, an early freedom man.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_202.wav|He journeyed here on what today we'd call a little wooden boat.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_203.wav|And like the other pilgrims, he was looking for a home that would be free.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_204.wav|I've spoken of the shining city all my political life, but I don't know if I ever quite communicated what I saw when I said it.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_205.wav|But in my mind, it was a tall, proud city, built on rocks stronger than oceans, windswept, God blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_206.wav|A city with pre-ports that hummed with commerce and creativity.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_207.wav|And if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors, and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_208.wav|That's how I saw it and see it still.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_209.wav|And how stands the city on this winter night?
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_210.wav|More prosperous, more secure and happier than it was eight years ago.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_211.wav|But more than that, after 200 years, two centuries, she still stands strong and true on the granite ridge, and her glow is held steady, no matter what storm.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_212.wav|And she's still a beacon, still a magnet for all who must have freedom, for all the pilgrims from all the lost places who are hurtling through the darkness toward home.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_213.wav|We've done our part, and as I walk off into the city streets, a final word of the men and women of the Reagan Revolution, the men and women across America, who for eight years did the work that brought America back.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_214.wav|My friends, we did it.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_215.wav|We weren't just marking time.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_216.wav|We made the city stronger.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_217.wav|We made the city freer, and we left her in good hands.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_218.wav|All in all, not bad, not bad at all.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_219.wav|And so goodbye.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_220.wav|God bless you and God bless the United States of America.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_001.wav|thank you ladies and gentlemen, mr. speaker, mr. president, members of the congress, distinguished guests and my fellow americans, it's great to be home and Nancy and i thank you for this wonderful homecoming and before i go on i want to say a personal thank you to Nancy, she was an outstanding ambassador of goodwill for all of us,
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_002.wav|i want you to know that your statements of support here were greatly appreciated,
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_003.wav|you can't imagine how much it means in dealing with the Soviets to have the congress, the allies and the american people,
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_004.wav|general secretary Gorbachev,
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_005.wav|in the past few days,
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_006.wav|the past two days,
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_007.wav|we spent over 15 hours in various meetings with the general secretary and the members of his official party, and approximately five of those hours were talks between mr. Gorbachev and myself, just one on one, that was the best part, our fireside summit, there will be, i know a great deal of commentary and opinion as to what the meetings produced and what they were like, there were over 3000 reporters in jeneva, so it's possible there will be 3000 opinions castor in me, but i decided to file my own report as we had to meet, i called for a fresh start and we made that start, i can't claim that we had a meeting of the minds on such fundamentals as ideology or national purpose, but we understand each other better and that's a key to peace,
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_008.wav|i gained a better perspective, i feel he did too, it was a constructive meeting, so constructive in fact that i look forward to welcoming mr. Gorbachev to the united states next year,
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_009.wav|accepted his invitation to go to maska,
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_010.wav|the following year,
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_011.wav|our subject matter was shaped by the facts of this century,
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_012.wav|these past 40 years have not been an easy time for the west or for the world,
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_013.wav|you know the facts, there is no need to recite the historical record,
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_014.wav|suffice it to say that the united states cannot afford illusions about the nature of the USSR,
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_015.wav|we cannot assume that their ideology and purpose will change, this implies enduring competition,
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_016.wav|our task is to assure that this competition remains peaceful, with all the divides as we cannot afford to let confusion complicate things further, we must be clear with each other and direct, we must pay each other the tribute of candor,
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_017.wav|when i took the oath of office for the first time we began dealing with the Soviet union in a way that was more realistic than in say the recent past, and so in a very real sense, preparations for the summit started not months ago but five years ago, when with the help of congress we began strengthening our economy, restoring our national will and rebuilding our defenses and alliances,
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_018.wav|America is once again strong and our strength has given us the ability to speak with confidence and see that no true opportunity to advance freedom and peace is lost.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_019.wav|I need your continued support to keep America strong, that is the history behind the Geneva summit and that is the context in which it occurred and may I add that we were especially eager that our meetings give a push to important talks already underway on reducing nuclear weapons, on this subject it would be foolish not to go the extra mile, or in this case the extra 4,000 miles, we discussed the great issues of our time.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_020.wav|I made clear before the first meeting that no question would be swept aside, no issue buried just because either side found it uncomfortable or inconvenient.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_021.wav|I brought these questions to the summit and put them before Mr. Gorbachev.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_022.wav|We discussed nuclear arms and how to reduce them.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_023.wav|I explained our proposals for equitable, verifiable and deep reductions.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_024.wav|I outlined my conviction that our proposals would make not just for a world that feels safer but one that is really safer.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_025.wav|And I'm pleased to report tonight that General Secretary Gorbachev and I did make a measure of progress here.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_026.wav|We moved arms control forward from where we were last January when the Soviets returned to the table.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_027.wav|We are both instructing our negotiators to hasten their vital work and the world is waiting for the results.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_028.wav|Specifically, we agreed in Geneva that each side should move to cut offensive nuclear arms by 50 percent in appropriate categories.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_029.wav|In our joint statement, we called for early progress on this, turning the talks toward our chief goal, offensive reductions.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_030.wav|We called for an interim accord on intermediate-range nuclear forces, leading, I hope, to the complete elimination of this class of missiles.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_031.wav|And all of this, with tough verification, an arms control area at which we've cooperated effectively over the years.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_032.wav|We're also opening a dialogue on combating the spread and use of chemical weapons while moving to ban them all together and in stock home on lessening the chances for surprise attack in Europe, also received a boost.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_033.wav|And finally, we agreed to begin work on risk reduction centers, a decision that should give special satisfaction to senators none in order who so ably promoted this idea.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_034.wav|Our research effort that envisions the possibility of defensive systems which could ultimately protect all nations against the danger of nuclear war.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_035.wav|This discussion produced a very direct exchange of views.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_036.wav|Mr. Gorbachev insisted that we might use a strategic defense system to put offensive weapons into space and establish nuclear superiority.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_037.wav|I made it clear that SDI has nothing to do with offensive weapons, that instead we're investigating non-nuclear defense systems that would only threaten offensive missiles not people.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_038.wav|It will bring much closer the safer, more stable world that we seek.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_039.wav|Nations could defend themselves against missile attack, and mankind at long last escaped the prison of mutual terror.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_040.wav|And this is my dream.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_041.wav|So I welcome the chance to tell Mr. Gorbachev that we are a nation that defends rather than attacks, that our alliances are defensive, not offensive.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_042.wav|We don't seek nuclear superiority.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_043.wav|We do not seek a first strike advantage over the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_044.wav|Indeed, one of my fundamental arms control objectives is to get rid of first strike weapons altogether, posed a 50% reduction in the most threatening nuclear weapons, especially those that could carry out a first strike.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_045.wav|I went further in expressing our peaceful intentions.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_046.wav|I described our proposal in the Geneva negotiations for a reciprocal program of open laboratories in strategic defense research.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_047.wav|We're offering to permit Soviet experts to see firsthand that SDI does not involve offensive weapons.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_048.wav|American scientists would be allowed to visit comparable facilities of the Soviet strategic defense program, which in fact has involved much more than research for many years.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_049.wav|Finally, I reassured Mr. Gorbachev on another point.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_050.wav|I promised that if our research reveals that a defense against nuclear missiles is possible, we would sit down with our allies and the Soviet Union to see how together we could replace all strategic ballistic missiles with such a defense which threatens no one.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_051.wav|We discussed threats to the peace in several regions of the world.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_052.wav|I explained my proposals for a peace process to stop the wars in Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Ethiopia, Angola, and Cambodia, which obviously do not represent the will or the approval of the people.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_053.wav|I tried to be very clear about where our sympathies lie.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_054.wav|I believe I succeeded.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_055.wav|We discussed human rights.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_056.wav|We Americans believe that history retie teaches no clearer lesson than this.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_057.wav|Those countries which respect the rights of their own people tended evitably to respect.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_058.wav|Finally, we discussed the barriers to communication between our societies.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_059.wav|I elaborated on my proposals for real people to people contacts on a wide scale.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_060.wav|Americans should know the people of the Soviet Union, their hopes and fears and the facts of their lives.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_061.wav|And citizens of the Soviet Union need to know of America's deep desire for peace and our unwavering attachment to freedom.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_062.wav|As you can see, our talks were wide-ranging.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_063.wav|And let me, at this point, tell you what we agreed upon and what we didn't.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_064.wav|We remain far apart in a number of issues, as had to be expected.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_065.wav|However, we reached agreement on a number of matters.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_066.wav|And as I mentioned, we agreed to continue meeting.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_067.wav|And this is important and very good.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_068.wav|We've concluded a new agreement designed to bring the best of America's artists and academics to the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_069.wav|The exhibits that will be included in this exchange are one of the most effective ways for the average Soviet citizen to learn about our way of life.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_070.wav|This agreement will also expand the opportunities for Americans to experience the Soviet people's rich cultural heritage because their artists and academics will be coming here.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_071.wav|We've also decided to go forward with a number of people to people initiatives that will go beyond greater contact, not only between the political leaders of our two countries, but our respective students, teachers, and others as well.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_072.wav|We have emphasized youth exchanges, and this will help break down stereotypes, build friendships, and, frankly, provide an alternative to propaganda.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_073.wav|We've agreed to establish a new Soviet consulate in New York and a new American consulate in Kiev.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_074.wav|Together with the government of Japan, concluded a Pacific Air Safety Agreement with the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_075.wav|This is designed to set up cooperative measures to improve civil air safety in that region of the Pacific.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_076.wav|We have also advocated international cooperation to explore the feasibility of developing fusion energy.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_077.wav|All of these steps are part of a long-term effort to build a more stable relationship with the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_078.wav|No one ever said it could be easy, but we've come a long way.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_079.wav|As for Soviet expansionism in a number of regions of the world, while there's little chance of immediate change, we will continue to support the heroic efforts of those who fight for freedom.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_080.wav|But we have also agreed to continue and to intensify our meetings with the Soviets on this and other regional conflicts and to work toward political solutions.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_081.wav|We know the limits as well as the promise of summit meetings.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_082.wav|This is after all the 11th summit of the post-war era, and still the differences endure.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_083.wav|But we believe continued leaders, continued meetings between the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union, can help bridge those differences.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_084.wav|The fact is every new day begins with possibilities.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_085.wav|It's up to us to fill it with the things that move us toward progress and peace.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_086.wav|Hope, therefore, is a realistic attitude and despair and uninteresting little vice.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_087.wav|And so was our journey worthwhile?
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_088.wav|Well, 30 years ago, when he
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_089.wav|Like President Eisenhower had just returned from a summit in Geneva, he said, the wide Gulf that separates so far, east and west, is wide and deep.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_090.wav|Well, today, three decades later, that is still true.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_091.wav|But yes, the summit itself was a good start, and now our byword must be, steady as we go.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_092.wav|I am as you are impatient for results, but goodwill and good hopes do not always yield lasting results.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_093.wav|And quick fixes don't fix big problems.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_094.wav|Just as we must avoid illusions on our side, so we must dispel them on the Soviet side.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_095.wav|I've made it clear to Mr. Gorbachev that we must reduce the mistrust and suspicions between us if we are to do such things as reduce arms.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_096.wav|And this will take deeds, not words alone.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_097.wav|And I believe he is in agreement.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_098.wav|Where do we go from here?
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_099.wav|Well, our desire for improved relations is strong.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_100.wav|We're ready and eager for step-by-step progress.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_101.wav|We know that peace is not just the absence of war.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_102.wav|We don't want a phony peace or a frail peace.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_103.wav|We didn't go and pursue to some kind of illusory detente.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_104.wav|We can't be satisfied with cosmetic improvements that won't stand the test of time.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_105.wav|We want real peace.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_106.wav|As I flew back this evening, I had many thoughts.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_107.wav|In just a few days, families across America will gather to celebrate Thanksgiving.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_108.wav|And again, as our forefathers who voids to America, we travel to Geneva with peace as our goal and freedom as our guide, for there can be no greater good than the quest for peace and no finer purpose than the preservation of freedom.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_109.wav|When pilgrims and Indians huddle together the edge of an unknown continent.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_110.wav|And now here we are gathered together on the edge of an unknown future.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_111.wav|But like our forefathers, we're really not so much afraid.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_001.wav|well, in the hospital, I had, as you can readily understand, a lot of time for reflection.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_002.wav|And one day, I decided to send a personal handwritten letter to Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev, reminding him that we had met about 10 years ago in San Clemente, California, as he and President Nixon were concluding a series of meetings that had brought hope to all the world.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_003.wav|Never had peace and goodwill seemed closer at hand.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_004.wav|I'd like to read you a few paragraphs from that letter.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_005.wav|Mr. President, when we met, I asked if you were aware that the hopes and aspirations of millions of people throughout the world were dependent on the decisions that would be reached in those meetings.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_006.wav|You took my hand in both of yours and assured me that you were aware of that and that you were dedicated with all your heart and soul and mind to fulfilling those hopes and dreams.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_007.wav|I went on in my letter to say, the people of the world still share that hope.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_008.wav|Indeed, the peoples of the world, despite differences in rational and ethnic origin, have very much in common.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_009.wav|They want the dignity of having some control over their individual lives, their destiny.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_010.wav|They want to work at the craft or trade of their own choosing and to be fairly rewarded.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_011.wav|They want to raise their families in peace without harming anyone or suffering harm themselves.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_012.wav|Government exists for their convenience, not the other way around.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_013.wav|If they're incapable, as some would have us believe, of self-government, then where among them do we find any who are capable of governing others?
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_014.wav|Is it possible that we have permitted ideology, political and economic philosophies and governmental policies to keep us from considering the very real everyday problems of our peoples?
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_015.wav|Will the average Soviet family be better off or even aware that the Soviet Union has imposed a government of its own choice on the people of Afghanistan?
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_016.wav|Is life better for the people of Cuba because the Cuban military dictate who shall govern the people of Angola?
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_017.wav|It is often implied that such things have been made necessary because of territorial ambitions of the United States, that we have imperialistic designs, and they thus constitute a threat to your own security and that of the newly emerging nations.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_018.wav|There not only is no evidence to support such a charge, there is solid evidence that the United States, when it could, have dominated the world with no risk to itself, made no effort whatsoever to do so.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_019.wav|When World War 2 ended, the United States had the only undamaged industrial power in the world.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_020.wav|Our military might was at its peak, and we alone had the ultimate weapon, the nuclear weapon, with the unquestioned ability to deliver it anywhere in the world.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_021.wav|If we had sought world domination, then who could have opposed us?
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_022.wav|But the United States followed a different course, one unique in all the history of mankind.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_023.wav|We used our power and wealth to rebuild the war ravaged economies of the world, including those of the nations who had been our enemies.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_024.wav|May I say, there is absolutely no substance to charges that the United States is guilty of imperialism or attempts to impose its will on other countries by use of force.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_025.wav|I continued my letter by saying, or concluded my letter,
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_026.wav|I should say, by saying,
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_027.wav|Mr. President, should we not be concerned with eliminating the obstacles which prevent our people, those you and I represent from achieving their most cherished goals.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_028.wav|Well, it's in the same spirit that I want to speak to this audience and the people of the world about America's program for peace and the coming negotiations which begin November 30 in Geneva, Switzerland.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_029.wav|Specifically, I want to present our program for preserving peace in Europe and our wider program for arms control.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_030.wav|Twice in my lifetime, I have seen the peoples of Europe plunged into the tragedy of war.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_031.wav|Twice in my lifetime, Europe has suffered destruction and military occupation in wars that statesman proved powerless to prevent soldiers unable to contain and ordinary citizens unable to escape.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_032.wav|And twice in my lifetime, young Americans have bled their lives into the soil of those battlefields, not to enrich or enlarge our domain, but to restore the peace and independence of our friends and allies.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_033.wav|All of us who live through those troubled times share a common resolve that they must know, and most of us share a common appreciation of the Atlantic Alliance that has made a peaceful, free and prosperous Western Europe in the post-war era possible.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_034.wav|But today, a new generation is emerging on both sides of the Atlantic.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_035.wav|Its members were not present at the creation of the North Atlantic Alliance.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_036.wav|Many of them don't fully understand its roots in defending freedom and rebuilding a war to encontinue it.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_037.wav|Some young people question why we need weapons, particularly nuclear weapons, to deter war and to assure peaceful development.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_038.wav|They fear that the accumulation of weapons itself may lead to conflagration.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_039.wav|Some even propose unilateral disarmament.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_040.wav|I understand their concerns, their questions deserve to be answered.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_041.wav|But we have an obligation to answer their questions on the basis of judgment and reason and experience.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_042.wav|Our policies have resulted in the longest European peace in this century.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_043.wav|Wouldn't a rash departure from these policies as some now suggest endanger that peace?
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_044.wav|From its founding, the Atlantic Alliance has preserved the peace through unity, deterrence, and dialogue.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_045.wav|First, we and our allies have stood united by the firm commitment that an attack upon any one of us would be considered an attack upon us all.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_046.wav|Second, we and our allies have deterred aggression by maintaining forces strong enough to ensure that any aggressor would lose more from an attack than he could possibly gain.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_047.wav|Third, we and our allies have engaged the Soviets in a dialogue about mutual restraint and arms limitations, hoping to reduce the risk of war and the burden of armaments and to lower the barriers that divide east from west.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_048.wav|These three elements of our policy have preserved the peace in Europe for more than a third of a century.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_049.wav|They can preserve it for generations to come, so long as we pursue them with sufficient will and vigor.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_050.wav|Today, I wish to reaffirm America's commitment to the Atlantic Alliance and I'll resolve to sustain the peace.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_051.wav|And from my conversations with Allied leaders, I know that they also remain true to this tried and proven course.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_052.wav|NATO's policy of peace is based on restraint and balance.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_053.wav|No NATO weapons, conventional or nuclear will ever be used in Europe except in response to attack.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_054.wav|NATO's defense plans have been responsible and restrained.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_055.wav|The allies remain strong, united and resolute.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_056.wav|But the momentum of the continuing Soviet military build-up threatens both the conventional and the nuclear balance.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_057.wav|Consider the facts.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_058.wav|Over the past decade, the United States reduced the size of its armed forces and decreased its military spending.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_059.wav|The Soviets steadily increased the number of men under arms. They now number more than double those of the United States.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_060.wav|Over the same period, the Soviets expanded their real military spending by about one-third.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_061.wav|The Soviet Union increased its inventory of tanks to some 50,000 compared to our 11,000.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_062.wav|Historically, a land power they transformed their navy from a coastal defense force to an open ocean fleet, while the United States, a sea power with trans-oceanic alliances, cut its fleet in half.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_063.wav|During a period when NATO deployed no new intermediate-range nuclear missiles and actually withdrew 1,000 nuclear warheads, the Soviet Union deployed more than 750 nuclear warheads on the new SS-20 missiles alone.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_064.wav|Our response to this relentless build-up of Soviet military power has been restrained but firm.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_065.wav|We have made decisions to strengthen all three legs of the strategic triad, sea, land and air-based.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_066.wav|We have proposed a defense program of the United States for the next five years which will remedy the neglect of the past decade and restore the eroding balance on which our security depends.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_067.wav|I would like to discuss more specifically the growing threat to Western Europe which is posed by the continuing deployment of certain Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_068.wav|The Soviet Union has three different types such missile systems, the SS-20, the SS-4 and the SS-5, all with a range capable of reaching virtually all of Western Europe.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_069.wav|There are other Soviet weapon systems which also represent a major threat.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_070.wav|Now the only answer to these systems is a comparable threat to Soviet threats.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_071.wav|To Soviet targets, in other words, a deterrent, preventing the use of these Soviet weapons by the counter-threat of a like-response against their own territory.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_072.wav|At present, however, there is no equivalent deterrent to these Soviet intermediate missiles and the Soviets continue to add one new SS-20 a week.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_073.wav|To counter this the Allies agreed in 1979 as part of a two-track decision to deploy as a deterrent land-based cruise missiles and perishing two missiles capable of reaching targets in the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_074.wav|These missiles are to be deployed in several countries of Western Europe.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_075.wav|This relatively limited force in no way serves as a substitute for the much larger strategic umbrella spread over our NATO Allies.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_076.wav|Rather it provides a vital link between conventional shorter-range nuclear forces in Europe and intercontinental forces in the United States.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_077.wav|Deployment of these systems will demonstrate to the Soviet Union that this link cannot be broken.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_078.wav|Deturing war depends on the perceived ability of our forces to perform effectively.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_079.wav|The more effective our forces are, the less likely it is that we'll have to use them.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_080.wav|So we and our allies are proceeding to modernize NATO's nuclear forces of intermediate range to meet increased Soviet deployments of nuclear systems threatening Western Europe.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_081.wav|Now, let me turn now to our hopes for arms control negotiations.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_082.wav|There's a tendency to make this entire subject overly complex.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_083.wav|I want to be clear and concise.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_084.wav|I told you of the letter I wrote to President Brezhnev last April, well, I've just sent another message to the Soviet leadership.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_085.wav|It's a simple straightforward yet historic message.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_086.wav|The United States proposes the mutual reduction of conventional, intermediate range nuclear and strategic forces.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_087.wav|Specifically, I have proposed a four-point agenda to achieve this objective in my letter to President Brezhnev.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_088.wav|The first and most important point concerns the Geneva negotiations.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_089.wav|As part of the 1979 two-track decision, NATO made a commitment to seek arms control negotiations with the Soviet Union on intermediate range nuclear forces.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_090.wav|The United States has been preparing for these negotiations through close consultation with our NATO partners.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_091.wav|We're now ready to set forth our proposal.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_092.wav|I have informed President Brezhnev that when our delegation travels to the negotiations on intermediate range land-based nuclear missiles in Geneva on the 30th of this month, my representatives will present the following proposal.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_093.wav|The United States is prepared to cancel its deployment of Pershing-2 and Ground Launch missiles if the Soviets will dismantle their SS-20, SS-4, and SS-5 missiles.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_094.wav|This would be an historic step.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_095.wav|With Soviet agreement, we could together substantially reduce the dread threat of nuclear war which hangs over the people of Europe.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_096.wav|This, like the first footstep on the moon, would be a giant step for mankind.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_097.wav|Now, we intend to negotiate in good faith and go to Geneva willing to listen and to and consider the proposals of our Soviet counterpots.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_098.wav|But let me call to your attention the background of which, against which our proposal is made.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_099.wav|During the past six years, while the United States deployed no new intermediate range missiles and withdrew 1,000 nuclear warheads from Europe, the Soviet Union deployed 750 warheads on mobile, accurate ballistic missiles.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_100.wav|They now have 1,100 warheads on the SS-20s, SS-4s, and 5s.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_101.wav|And the United States has no comparable missiles.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_102.wav|Indeed, the United States dismantled the last such missile in Europe over 15 years ago.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_103.wav|As we look to the future of the negotiations, it's also important to address certain Soviet claims which left unrefuted could become critical berries to real progress in arms control.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_104.wav|The Soviets assert that a balance of intermediate-range nuclear forces already exists.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_105.wav|That assertion is wrong.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_106.wav|By any objective measure, as this chart indicates, the Soviet Union has developed an increasingly overwhelming advantage.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_107.wav|They now enjoy a superiority on the order of 6 to 1.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_108.wav|The red is the Soviet buildup.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_109.wav|The blue is our own.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_110.wav|That is 1975, and that is 1981.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_111.wav|Now, Soviet spokesmen have suggested that moving their SS-20s behind the Euro-Mounts will remove the threat to Europe.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_112.wav|Well, as this map demonstrates, the SS-20s, even if deployed behind the Euro-Mounts, will have a range that puts almost all of Western Europe, the great cities, Rome, Athens, Paris, London, Brussels, Amsterdam, Berlin, and so many more, all of Scandinavia, all of the Middle East, all of Northern Africa, all within range of these missiles, which incidentally are mobile, and can be moved on shorter notice.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_113.wav|These little images mark the present location, which would give them a range clear out into the Atlantic.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_114.wav|The second proposal that I've made to President Brezhnev concerns strategic weapons.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_115.wav|The United States proposes to open negotiations on strategic arms as soon as possible next year.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_116.wav|I have instructed Secretary Hague to discuss the timing of such meetings with Soviet representatives.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_117.wav|Substance, however, is far more important than timing.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_118.wav|As our proposal for the Geneva talks this month illustrates, we can make proposals for genuinely serious reductions, not only if we take the time to prepare carefully.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_119.wav|The United States has been preparing carefully for resumption of strategic arms negotiations because we don't want a repetition of past disappointments.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_120.wav|We don't want an arms control process that sends hope soaring only to end in dashed expectations.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_121.wav|Now, I have informed President Brezhnev that we will seek to negotiate substantial reductions in nuclear arms, which would result in levels that are equal and verifiable.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_122.wav|Our approach to verification will be to emphasize openness and creativity rather than the secrecy and suspicion which have undermined confidence in arms control in the past.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_123.wav|While we can hope to benefit from work done over the past decade in strategic arms negotiations, let us agree to do more than simply begin where these previous efforts left off.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_124.wav|We can and should attempt major qualitative and quantitative progress.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_125.wav|Only such progress can fulfill the hopes of our own people and the rest of the world.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_126.wav|And let us see how far we can go in achieving truly substantial reductions in our strategic arsenal.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_127.wav|To symbolize this fundamental change in direction, we will call these negotiations start.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_128.wav|Strategic arms reduction talks.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_129.wav|The third proposal I have made to the Soviet Union is that we act to achieve equality at lower levels of conventional forces in Europe.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_130.wav|The defense needs of the Soviet Union hardly call for maintaining more combat divisions in East Germany today that were in the whole allied invasion force that landed in Normandy on D-Day.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_131.wav|The Soviet Union could make no more convincing contribution to peace in Europe and in the world than by agreeing to reduce its conventional forces significantly and constrain the potential for sudden aggression.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_132.wav|Finally, I have pointed out to President Brezhnev that to maintain peace, we must reduce the risks of surprise attack and the chance of war arising out of uncertainty or miscalculation.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_133.wav|I am renewing our proposal for a conference to develop effective measures that would reduce these dangers.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_134.wav|At the current Madrid meeting of the conference on security and cooperation in Europe, we are laying the foundation for a Western proposed conference on disarmament in Europe.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_135.wav|This conference would discuss new measures to enhance stability and security in Europe.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_136.wav|Agreement in this conference is within reach.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_137.wav|I urge the Soviet Union to join us and many other nations who are ready to launch this important enterprise.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_138.wav|All of these proposals are based on the same fair-minded principles, substantial, militarily significant reduction in forces, equal ceilings for similar types of forces and adequate provisions for verification.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_139.wav|My administration, our country, and I are committed to achieving arms reductions agreements based on these principles.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_140.wav|Today, I have outlined the kinds of bold, equitable proposals which the world expects of us, but we cannot reduce arms unilaterally.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_141.wav|Success can only come if the Soviet Union will share our commitment, if it will demonstrate that its often repeated professions of concern for peace will be matched by positive action.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_142.wav|Preservation of peace in Europe and the pursuit of arms reduction talks are a fundamental importance, but we must also help to bring peace and security to regions now torn by conflict, external intervention, and war.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_143.wav|The American concept of peace goes well beyond the absence of war.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_144.wav|We foresee a flowering of economic growth and individual liberty in a world at peace.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_145.wav|At the economic summit conference in Cancun, I met with the leaders of 21 nations and sketched out for our approach to global economic growth.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_146.wav|We want to eliminate the barriers to trade and investment which hinder these critical incentives to growth, and we're working to develop new programs to help the poorest nations achieve self-sustaining growth.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_147.wav|And terms like peace and security, we have to say have little meaning for the oppressed in the destitute.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_148.wav|They also mean little to the individual whose state has stripped him of human freedom and dignity.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_149.wav|Wherever there's oppression, we must strive for the peace and security of individuals as well as states.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_150.wav|We must recognize that progress in the pursuit of liberty is a necessary complement to military security.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_151.wav|Nowhere has this fundamental truth been more boldly and clearly stated than in the Helsinki Accords of 1975.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_152.wav|These accords have not yet been translated into living reality.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_153.wav|Today, I have announced an agenda that can help to achieve peace, security, and freedom across the globe.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_154.wav|In particular, I have made an important offer to forego entirely, deployment of new American missiles in Europe, if the Soviet Union is prepared to respond on an equal footing.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_155.wav|There is no reason why people in any part of the world should have to live in permanent fear of war or its specter.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_156.wav|I believe the time has come for all nations to act in a responsible spirit that doesn't threaten other states.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_157.wav|I believe the time is right to move forward on arms control and the resolution of critical regional disputes at the conference table.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_158.wav|Nothing will have a higher priority for me and for the American people over the coming months and years.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_159.wav|Addressing the United Nations 20 years ago, another American president described the goal that we still pursue today.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_160.wav|He said, if we all can persevere, if we can look beyond our shores and ambitions, then surely the age will dawn in which the strong are just and the weak secure and the peace preserved.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_161.wav|He didn't live to see that goal achieved.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_162.wav|I invite all nations to join with America today in the quest for such a world.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_001.wav|Mr. President, Vice President Bush, Vice President Mondale, Senator Baker, Speaker O'Neil, Reverend MuMaw and my fellow citizens.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_002.wav|To a few of us here today, this is a solemn and most momentous occasion, and yet in the history of our nation, it is a commonplace occurrence.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_003.wav|The orderly transfer of authority has called for in the Constitution, routinely takes place as it has for almost two centuries, and few of us stop to think how unique we really are.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_004.wav|In the eyes of many in the world, this every four years ceremony we accept as normal is nothing less than a miracle.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_005.wav|Mr. President,
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_006.wav|I want our fellow citizens to know how much you did to carry on this tradition.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_007.wav|By your gracious cooperation in the transition process, you have shown a watching world that we are a united people pledged to maintaining a political system which guarantees individual liberty to a greater degree than any other.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_008.wav|And I thank you and your people for all your help in maintaining the continuity, which is the bulwark of our republic.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_009.wav|These United States are confronted with an economic affliction of great proportions.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_010.wav|We suffer from the longest and one of the worst sustained inflation in our national history.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_011.wav|It distorts our economic decisions, penalizes thrift, and crushes the struggling young and the fixed income elderly alike.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_012.wav|It threatens to straddle the lives of millions of our people, idle industries of cast workers into one employment, human misery, and personal indignity.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_013.wav|Those who do work are denied a fair return for their labor by a tax system which penalizes successful achievement and keeps us from maintaining full productivity.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_014.wav|But great as our tax burden is, it has not kept pace with public spending.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_015.wav|For decades, we have piled deficit upon deficit, mortgaging our future and our children's future for the temporary convenience of the present.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_016.wav|To continue this long trend is to guarantee tremendous social, cultural, political, and economic upheavals.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_017.wav|You and I, as individuals, can by borrowing, live beyond our means, but for only a limited period of time.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_018.wav|Why then should we think that collectively as a nation, we are not bound by that same limitation?
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_019.wav|We must act today in order to preserve tomorrow and let there be no misunderstanding.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_020.wav|We are going to begin to act, beginning today.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_021.wav|The economic yields we suffer have come upon us over several decades.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_022.wav|They will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will go away.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_023.wav|They will go away because we, as Americans, have the capacity now as we've had in the past to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_024.wav|In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_025.wav|Government is the problem.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_026.wav|To be managed by self-rule, that government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_027.wav|Well, if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else?
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_028.wav|All of us together, in and out of government, must bear the burden.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_029.wav|The solutions we seek must be equitable with no one group singled out to pay a higher price.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_030.wav|We hear much of special interest groups.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_031.wav|Well, our concern must be for a special interest group that has been too long neglected.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_032.wav|It knows no sectional boundaries or ethnic and racial divisions, and it crosses political party lines.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_033.wav|It is made up of men and women who raise our food, patrol our streets, man our minds and factories, teach our children, keep our homes, and heal us when we're sick.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_034.wav|Professionals, industrialists, shopkeepers, clerks, cabbys, and truck drivers.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_035.wav|They are, in short, we the people.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_036.wav|This breed called Americans.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_037.wav|Well, this administration's objective will be a healthy, vigorous, growing economy that provides equal opportunities for all Americans with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_038.wav|Putting America back to work means putting all Americans back to work.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_039.wav|Ending inflation means freeing all Americans from the terror of runaway living costs.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_040.wav|All must share in the productive work of this new beginning and all must share in the bounty of a revived economy.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_041.wav|With the idealism and fair play which are the core of our system and our strength, we can have a strong and prosperous America at peace with itself and the world.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_042.wav|So as we begin, let us take inventory.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_043.wav|We are a nation that has a government, not the other way around, and this makes us special among the nations of the earth.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_044.wav|Our government has no power except that granted it by the people.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_045.wav|It is time to check and reverse the growth of government which shows signs of having grown beyond the consent of the governed.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_046.wav|It is my intention to curb the size and influence of the federal establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between the powers granted to the federal government and those reserved to the states, it's not my intention to do away with government.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_047.wav|It is rather to make it work.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_048.wav|Work with us, not over us, to stand by our side, not ride on our back.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_049.wav|Government can and must provide opportunity, not smother it, foster productivity, not stifle it.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_050.wav|If we look to the answer, as to why for so many years we achieved so much, prospered as no other people on earth.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_051.wav|It was because here in this land we unleashed the energy and individual genius of man to a greater extent than has ever been done before.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_052.wav|Freedom and the dignity of the individual have been more available and assured here than in any other place on earth.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_053.wav|The price for this freedom at times has been high, but we have never been unwilling to pay that price.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_054.wav|It is no coincidence that our present troubles parallel and our proportionate to the intervention and intrusion in our lives that result from unnecessary and excessive growth of government.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_055.wav|It is time for us to realize that we are too great a nation to limit ourselves to small dreams.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_056.wav|We are not, as some would have us believe, doomed to an inevitable decline.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_057.wav|I do not believe in a fate that will fall on us no matter what we do.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_058.wav|I do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we do nothing.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_059.wav|So with all the creative energy at our command, let us begin an era of national renewal.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_060.wav|Let us renew our determination, our courage, and our strength, and let us renew our faith and our hope.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_061.wav|We have every right to dream heroic dreams.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_062.wav|Those who say that we are in a time when there are no heroes, they just don't know where to look.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_063.wav|You can see heroes every day going in and out of factory gates.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_064.wav|Others a handful in number, produce enough food to feed all of us, and then the world beyond.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_065.wav|You meet heroes across a counter and they are on both sides of that counter.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_066.wav|There are entrepreneurs with faith in themselves and faith in an idea who create new jobs, new wealth, and opportunity.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_067.wav|They are individuals and families who take taxes, support the government, and whose voluntary gifts support church, charity, culture, art, and education.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_068.wav|Their patriotism is quiet but deep.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_069.wav|Their values sustain our national life.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_070.wav|Now I have used the words they and they are in speaking of these heroes.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_071.wav|I could say you and you are because I am addressing the heroes of whom I speak, you the citizens of this blessed land.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_072.wav|Your dreams, your hopes, your goals are going to be the dreams, the hopes, and the goals of this administration so help me God.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_073.wav|How can we love our country and not love our countrymen and loving them?
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_074.wav|Reach out a hand when they fall.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_075.wav|Heal them when they are sick and provide opportunity to make themselves sufficient so they will be equally in fact and not just in theory.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_076.wav|Can we solve the problems confronting us?
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_077.wav|Well, the answer is an unequivocal and emphatic yes.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_078.wav|To paraphrase Winston Churchill, I did not take the oath I have just taken with the intention of presiding over the dissolution of the world's strongest economy.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_079.wav|In the days ahead, I will propose removing the roadblocks that have slowed our economy and reduced productivity.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_080.wav|Steps will be taken aimed at restoring the balance between the various levels of government.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_081.wav|Progress may be slow, measured in inches and feet, not miles, but we will progress.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_082.wav|It is time to reawaken this industrial giant to get government back within its means and to lighten our punitive tax burden, a man who might have been one of the greatest among the founding fathers.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_083.wav|Dr. Joseph Warren, President of the Massachusetts Congress, said to his fellow Americans, our country is in danger, but not to be spared of.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_084.wav|On you depend the fortunes of America.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_085.wav|You are to decide the important question upon which rest the happiness and the liberty of millions yet unborn.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_086.wav|Act worthy of yourselves.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_087.wav|Well, I believe we the Americans of today are ready to act worthy of ourselves, ready to do what must be done to ensure happiness and liberty for ourselves, our children, and our children's children.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_088.wav|And as we renew ourselves here in our own land, we will be seen as having greater strength throughout the world.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_089.wav|We will again be the exemplar of freedom and a beacon of hope for those who do not now have freedom.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_090.wav|To those neighbors and allies who share our freedom, we will strengthen our historic ties and assure them of our support and firm commitment.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_091.wav|We will match loyalty with loyalty.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_092.wav|We will strive for mutually beneficial relations.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_093.wav|We will not use our friendship to impose on their sovereignty, for our own sovereignty is not for sale.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_094.wav|As for the enemies of freedom, those who are potential adversaries, they will be reminded that peace is the highest aspiration of the American people.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_095.wav|We will negotiate for it, sacrifice for it, we will not surrender for it now or ever.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_096.wav|Our reluctance for conflicts should not be misjudged as a failure of will.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_097.wav|When action is required to preserve our national security, we will act.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_098.wav|We will maintain sufficient strength to prevail, if need be, knowing that if we do so, we have the best chance of never having to use that strength.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_099.wav|Above all, we must realize that no arsenal or no weapon in the arsenals of the world is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_100.wav|It is a weapon our adversaries in today's world do not have.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_101.wav|It is a weapon that we as Americans do have.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_102.wav|Let that be understood by those who practice terrorism and pray upon their neighbors.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_103.wav|And for that, I'm deeply grateful.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_104.wav|We are a nation under God, and I believe God intended for us to be free.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_105.wav|It would be fitting and good, I think, if on each inaugural day and future years, it should be declared a day of prayer.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_106.wav|This is the first time in our history that this ceremony has been held as you've been told on this west front of the Capitol.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_107.wav|Standing here, one faces a magnificent vista opening up on this city's special beauty and history.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_108.wav|At the end of this open mall are those shrines to the giants on whose shoulders we stand.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_109.wav|Directly in front of me, the monument to a monumental man, George Washington, father of our country, a man of humility who came to greatness reluctantly.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_110.wav|He led America out of revolutionary victory into infant nationhood.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_111.wav|After one side, the stateless memorial to Thomas Jefferson, a declaration of independence flames with his eloquence.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_112.wav|And then beyond the reflecting pool, the dignified columns of the Lincoln Memorial, whoever would understand in his heart, the meaning of America will find it in the life of Abraham Lincoln.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_113.wav|Beyond those moments, those monuments to heroism is the Potomac River and on the far shore, the sloping hills of Arlington National Cemetery with its row upon row of simple white markers, bearing crosses or stars of David.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_114.wav|They add up to only a tiny fraction of the price that has been paid for our freedom.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_115.wav|Each one of those markers is a monument to the kind of hero I spoke of earlier.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_116.wav|Their lives ended in places called Bellowwood, the Argon, Omaha Beach, Solano, and halfway around the world on Guadalcanal, Terawa Pork Chop Hill, the Chosin Reservoir, and in a hundred rice paddies and jungles of a place called Vietnam.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_117.wav|Under one such marker lies a young man, Martin Treptow, who left his job in a small town barber shop in 1917, to go to France with the famed Rainbow Division.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_118.wav|There on the western front, he was killed trying to carry a message between battalions under heavy artillery fire.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_119.wav|We're told that on his body was found a diary.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_120.wav|On the flyleaf, under the heading My Pledge, he had written these words,
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_121.wav|America must win this war.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_122.wav|Therefore I will work, I will save, I will sacrifice, I will endure, I will fight cheerfully and do my utmost as if the issue of the whole struggle depended on me alone.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_123.wav|The crisis we are facing today does not require of us, the kind of sacrifice that Martin Treptow and so many thousands of others were called upon to make.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_124.wav|It does require, however, our best effort and our willingness to believe in ourselves and to perform great deeds.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_125.wav|To believe that together with God's help we can and will resolve the problems which now confront us.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_126.wav|And after all, why shouldn't we believe that?
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_127.wav|We are Americans.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_001.wav|I congratulate all of you who are members of this historic 100th Congress of the United States of America.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_002.wav|In this 200th anniversary year of our Constitution, you and I stand on the shoulders of giants, men whose words and deeds put wind in the sails of freedom.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_003.wav|However, we must always remember that our Constitution is to be celebrated not for being old, but for being young.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_004.wav|Young with the same energy, spirit and promise that filled each eventful day in Philadelphia State House.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_005.wav|We will be guided tonight by their acts and we will be guided forever by their words.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_006.wav|Now, forgive me, but I can't resist sharing a story from those historic days.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_007.wav|Philadelphia was bursting with civic pride in the spring of 1787, and his newspapers began embellishing the arrival of the convention delegates with elaborate social classifications.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_008.wav|Governors of states were called excellency.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_009.wav|Justices and chancellors had reserved for them honorable with a capital H.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_010.wav|For Congressman, it was honorable with a small H.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_011.wav|And all others were referred to as the following respectable characters.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_012.wav|To declare that each of you must never be titled less than honorable.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_013.wav|And please join me in warm congratulations to the Speaker of the House.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_014.wav|Then as now, the Speakership had changed hands and another great son of Texas, Sam Rayburn.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_015.wav|Mr. Sam sat in your chair.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_016.wav|I cannot find better words than those used by President Eisenhower that evening.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_017.wav|He said, we shall have much to do together.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_018.wav|I am sure that we will get it done and that we shall do it in harmony and goodwill.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_019.wav|I renew that pledge to you, Mr. Speaker, and to Senate Majority Leader Robert Bird, who brings 34 years of distinguished service to the Congress may I say, though there are changes in the Congress, America's interests remain the same.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_020.wav|And I am confident that along with Republican leaders Bob Michael and Bob Dole, this Congress can make history.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_021.wav|Well, the results are something which we can all be proud.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_022.wav|Our inflation rate is now the lowest in a quarter of a century.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_023.wav|The prime interest rate has fallen from the 21.5 percent the month before we took office to 7.5 percent today, and those rates have triggered the most housing starts in eight years.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_024.wav|The unemployment rate still too high is the lowest in nearly seven years, and our people have created nearly 13 million new jobs.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_025.wav|Over 61 percent of everyone, over the age of 16, male and female is employed, the highest percentage on record.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_026.wav|Most important, America is at peace tonight, and freedom is on the march.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_027.wav|And we've done much these past years to restore our defenses, our alliances, and our leadership in the world.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_028.wav|I took a risk with regard to our action in Iran.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_029.wav|It did not work, and for that I assumed full responsibility.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_030.wav|The goals were worthy.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_031.wav|I do not believe it was wrong to try to establish contacts with a country of strategic importance, or to try to save lives.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_032.wav|And certainly it was not wrong what we wished, and serious mistakes were trying, made in trying to do so.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_033.wav|We will get to the bottom of this, and I will take whatever action is called for.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_034.wav|But in debating the past, in debating the past we must do not deny ourselves the successes of the future.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_035.wav|Let it never be said of this generation of Americans that we became so obsessed with failure that we refuse to take risks that could further the cause of peace and freedom in the world.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_036.wav|And the nation and the world are watching to see if we go forward together in the national interest or if we let partisanship weaken us.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_037.wav|And let there be no mistake about American policy.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_038.wav|We will not sit idly by if our interests or our friends in the Middle East are threatened, nor will we yield the terrorist blackmail.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_039.wav|And now ladies and gentlemen of the Congress, why don't we get to work?
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_040.wav|The world is a safer place.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_041.wav|Earlier this month I submitted a budget to defend America and maintain our momentum to make up for neglect in the last decade.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_042.wav|I ask you to vote out a defense and foreign affairs budget that says yes to protecting our country.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_043.wav|While the world is safer, it is not safe.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_044.wav|Since 1970, the Soviets have invested $500 billion more on their military forces than we have.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_045.wav|Even today, though nearly one in three Soviet families is without running hot water, and the average family spends two hours a day shopping for the basic necessities of life.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_046.wav|Their government still found the resources to transfer $75 billion in weapons to client states in the past five years.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_047.wav|Clients like Syria, Vietnam, Cuba, Libya, Angola, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, and Nicaragua.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_048.wav|With 120,000 Soviet combat and military personnel and 15,000 military advisors in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, can anyone still doubt their single-minded determination to expand their power?
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_049.wav|Despite this, the Congress cut my request for critical U.S. security assistance to free nations by 21% this year, as President, to say to you again tonight that there is no sure way to lose freedom than to lose our resolve.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_050.wav|Afghanistan yet it continues a brutal war and props up a regime whose days are clearly numbered.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_051.wav|We are ready to support a political solution that guarantees the rapid withdrawal of all Soviet troops and genuine self-determination for the Afghan people.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_052.wav|In Central America too, the cause of freedom is being tested, and our resolve is being tested there as well.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_053.wav|Here especially, the world is watching to see how this nation responds.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_054.wav|Today, over 90% of the people of Latin America live in democracy.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_055.wav|Democracy is on the march in Central and South America.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_056.wav|Communist Nicaragua is the odd man out, suppressing the church, the press, and democratic dissent, and promoting subversion in the region.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_057.wav|We support diplomatic efforts, but these efforts can never succeed if the Sandinistas win their war against the Nicaraguan people.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_058.wav|Our commitment to a Western hemisphere, safe from aggression, did not occur by spontaneous generation on the day that we took office.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_059.wav|It began with the Monroe Doctrine in 1823 and continues our historic bipartisan American policy.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_060.wav|Franklin Roosevelt said, we are determined to do everything possible to maintain peace on this hemisphere.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_061.wav|President Truman was very blunt.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_062.wav|International communism seeks to crush and undermine and destroy the independence of the Americans.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_063.wav|We cannot let that happen here.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_064.wav|And John F. Kennedy made clear that communist domination in this hemisphere can never and then suspended it.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_065.wav|We won't know how my words tonight will be reported there for one simple reason.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_066.wav|There is no free press in Nicaragua.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_067.wav|Nicaraguan freedom fighters have never asked us to wage their battle, but I will fight any effort to shut off their lifeblood and consign them to death, defeat, or a life without freedom.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_068.wav|And so we always remain open to more constructive relations with the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_069.wav|But more responsible Soviet conduct around the world is a key element of the US Soviet agenda.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_070.wav|Progress is also required in the other items of our agenda as well.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_071.wav|Real respect for human rights and more open contacts between our societies and, of course, arms reduction.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_072.wav|In Iceland last October, we had one moment of opportunity that the Soviets dashed because they sought to cripple our strategic defense initiative, SDI.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_073.wav|It's the path for both sides to a safer future, a system that defends human life instead of threatening it.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_074.wav|SDI will go forward.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_075.wav|The United States has made serious, fair, and far-reaching proposals to the Soviet Union, and this is a moment of rare opportunity for arms reduction.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_076.wav|But I will need an American negotiator's in Geneva, will need Congress support.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_077.wav|In acting the Soviet negotiating position into American law would not be the way to win a good agreement.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_078.wav|I will veto any effort that undercuts our national security.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_079.wav|We will work to expand our opportunities in international markets through the Uruguay round of trade negotiations, and to complete an historic free trade arrangement between the world's two largest trading partners, Canada and the United States.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_080.wav|Our basic trade policy remains the same.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_081.wav|We remain opposed as ever to protectionism because America's growth and future depend on trade.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_082.wav|But we will insist on trade that is fair and free.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_083.wav|We are always willing to be trade partners.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_084.wav|I begin with a gentle reminder that many of these are simply the incomplete obligations of the past.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_085.wav|The American people deserve to be impatient because we do not yet have the public house in order.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_086.wav|We have had great success in restoring our economic integrity, and we have rescued our nation from the worst economic mess since the depression.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_087.wav|But there is more to do.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_088.wav|Even though I have submitted it within the Graham Rudman Hollings deficit reduction target, I have seen suggestions that we might post-pone that timetable.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_089.wav|The American people have repeatedly rejected that shop-worn advice.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_090.wav|They know that we do not have deficits because people are taxed too little.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_091.wav|Next month, I will place two additional reforms before the Congress.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_092.wav|We have created a welfare monster that is a shocking indictment of our sense of priorities.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_093.wav|Our national welfare system consists of some 59 major programs and over 6,000 pages of federal laws and regulations on which more than $132 billion was spent in 1985.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_094.wav|I will propose a new national welfare strategy, a program of welfare reform through state-sponsored community-based demonstration projects.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_095.wav|This is the time to reform this outmoded social dinosaur and finally break the poverty trap.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_096.wav|Now, we will never abandon those who, through no fault of their own, must have our help.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_097.wav|It is widely said that America is losing her competitive edge.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_098.wav|Well, that won't happen if we act now.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_099.wav|How well prepared are we to enter the 21st century?
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_100.wav|In my lifetime, America set the standard for the world.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_101.wav|It is now time to determine that we should enter the next century having achieved a level of excellence unsurpassed in history.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_102.wav|We will achieve this first by guaranteeing that government does everything possible to promote America's ability to compete.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_103.wav|Second, we must act as individuals in a quest for excellence that will not be measured by new proposals or billions in new funding.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_104.wav|Rather, it involves an expenditure of American spirit and just plain American grit.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_105.wav|The Congress will soon receive my comprehensive proposals to enhance our competitiveness, including new science and technology centers.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_106.wav|Competitiveness also means giving our farmers a shot at participating fairly and fully in a changing world market.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_107.wav|Preparing for the future must begin as always with our children.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_108.wav|We need to set for them new and more rigorous goals.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_109.wav|We must demand more of ourselves and our children by raising literacy levels dramatically by the year 2000.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_110.wav|Our children should master the basic concepts of math and science, and let's insist that students not leave high school until they have studied and understood.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_111.wav|Finally, let's stop suppressing the spiritual core of our national being.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_112.wav|Our nation could not have been conceived without divine help.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_113.wav|Why is it that we can build a nation with our prayers, but we can't use a school room for voluntary prayer, but must go next to the workplace.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_114.wav|More than 20 million new jobs will be created before the new century unfolds, and by then our economy should be able to provide a job for everyone who wants to work.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_115.wav|We must also enable our workers to adapt to the rapidly changing nature of the workplace, and I will propose substantial new federal commitments, key to retraining and job mobility.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_116.wav|Over the next few weeks, I'll be sending the Congress a complete series of these special messages on budget reform, welfare reform, competitiveness, including education, trade, worker training, and assistance.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_117.wav|Agriculture and other subjects.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_118.wav|The Congress can give us these tools, but to make these tools work, it really comes down to just being our best, and that's the core of American greatness.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_119.wav|The responsibility of freedom presses us toward higher knowledge, and I believe moral and spiritual greatness.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_120.wav|Through lower taxes and smaller government, government has its ways of freeing people's spirits, but only we, each of us, can let the spirit soar against our own individual standards.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_121.wav|Excellence is what makes freedom ring, and isn't that what we do best.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_122.wav|We're entering our third century now, but is wrong to judge our nation by its years.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_123.wav|A calendar can't measure America because we were meant to be an endless experiment in freedom, with no limit to our reaches, no boundaries to what we can do, no end point to our hopes.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_124.wav|The United States Constitution is the impassioned and inspired vehicle by which we travel through history.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_125.wav|It grew out of the most fundamental inspiration of our existence, that we are here to serve him by living free, that living free releases in us the noblest of impulses and the best of our abilities, that we would use these gifts for good and generous purposes, and which secure them not just for ourselves, and for our children.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_126.wav|I won't count if you don't.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_127.wav|Nothing has been so heartwarming to me as speaking to America's young, and the little ones especially, so fresh-faced and so eager to know.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_128.wav|Well, from time to time, I've been with them they will ask about our Constitution, and I hope you members of Congress will not deem this a breach of protocol.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_129.wav|If you will permit me to share these thoughts again with the young people who might be listening or watching this evening.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_130.wav|I've read the Constitution of a number of countries, including the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_131.wav|Now some people are surprised to hear that they have a Constitution, and it even supposedly grants a number of freedoms to its people.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_132.wav|Many countries have written into their Constitution provisions for freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_133.wav|But if this is true, why is the Constitution of the United States so exceptional?
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_134.wav|Well, the difference is so small that it almost escapes you, but it's so great it tells you the whole story in just three words.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_135.wav|We, the people, in those other Constitution, the government tells the people of those countries what they're allowed to do.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_136.wav|In our Constitution, we, the people, tell the government what it can do, and it can do only those things listed in that document and no others.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_137.wav|Virtually every other revolution in history has just exchanged one set of rulers for another set of rulers.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_138.wav|Our revolution is the first to say the people, but wherever you are, America is depending on you to reach your highest and be your best, because here in America we the people.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_139.wav|Those are the kids on Christmas Day looking out from a frozen century post on the 38th parallel in Korea, or a board and aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean, million miles from home, but doing their duty.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_140.wav|We, the people, those are the warmhearted whose numbers we can't begin to count, who will begin the day with a little prayer for the hostages they will never know, and MIA families they will never meet.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_141.wav|Why?
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_142.wav|Because that's the way we are, this unique breed we call Americans.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_143.wav|We, the people, their farmers on tough times, but who never stop feeding a hungry world.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_144.wav|They're the volunteers at the hospital choking back their tears for the hundredth time, caring for a baby struggling for life because of a mother who used drugs.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_145.wav|And you'll forgive me a special memory.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_146.wav|It's a million mothers like Nelly Reagan, who never knew a stranger, or turned a hungry person away from her kitchen door.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_147.wav|We the people, they refute last week's television commentary downgrading our optimism and our idealism.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_148.wav|They are the entrepreneurs, the builders, the pioneers, and a lot of regular folks, the true heroes of our land who make up the most uncommon nation of doers in history.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_149.wav|You know they're Americans because their spirit is as big as the universe, and their hearts are bigger than their spirits.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_150.wav|We the people, starting the third century of a dream and standing up to some cynic who's trying to tell us we're not going to get any better.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_151.wav|Are we at the end?
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_152.wav|Well, I can't tell it any better than the real thing.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_153.wav|A story recorded by James Madison from the final moments of the Constitutional Convention, September 17, 1787.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_154.wav|As the last few members signed the document, Benjamin Franklin, the oldest delegate at 81 years and in frail health, looked over toward the chair where George Washington daily presided.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_155.wav|At the back of that chair was painted the picture of a son on the horizon, and turning those sitting next to him.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_156.wav|Franklin observed that artists found it difficult in their painting to distinguish between arising and a setting son.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_157.wav|When I know if we were there, we could see those delegates sitting around Franklin leaning in to listen more closely to him, and then Dr. Franklin began to share his deepest hopes and fears about the outcome of their efforts.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_158.wav|And this is what he said.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_159.wav|I have often looked at that picture behind the president without being able to tell whether it was a rising or setting son.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_160.wav|But now at length I have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a setting son.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_161.wav|But you can bet it's rising because my fellow citizens America isn't finished.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_162.wav|Her dead best days have just begun.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_163.wav|Thank you.
wavs/reagan_1994_001.wav|I am delighted to congratulate all of you on Young America's foundation's 15th annual National Conservative Student Conference.
wavs/reagan_1994_002.wav|Each year after my election in 1980, we hosted Young America's foundation at the White House.
wavs/reagan_1994_003.wav|Together we work to accomplish much of what has come to be known as the Reagan Revolution.
wavs/reagan_1994_004.wav|Much has been achieved since Young America's foundations first conferences in 1979 and 1980.
wavs/reagan_1994_005.wav|At that time, Soviet armies were on the march in Poland and Afghanistan.
wavs/reagan_1994_006.wav|Soviet armed surrogates were waging war across Africa and communist inspired insurgencies were gaining ground in our own hemisphere.
wavs/reagan_1994_007.wav|American diplomats were held hostage.
wavs/reagan_1994_008.wav|American prestige was at an all time low and our leaders talked about an American malaise.
wavs/reagan_1994_009.wav|Well, you and I knew better.
wavs/reagan_1994_010.wav|We knew there was nothing wrong with the American spirit and with a change of leadership in Washington, we helped turn the tide against totalitarianism.
wavs/reagan_1994_011.wav|A few months after our election, I went to the University of Notre Dame and warned of the evil empire.
wavs/reagan_1994_012.wav|I spoke of a day when we wouldn't just denounce communism, we would transcend it, leaving it as a sad, bizarre chapter in human history whose last pages are even now being written.
wavs/reagan_1994_013.wav|Although that forecast was much maligned, communism has been left on the ash heap of history and the evil empire no longer poses a threat to our very existence.
wavs/reagan_1994_014.wav|The fight against totalitarianism was a grand and noble cause, one that united us all.
wavs/reagan_1994_015.wav|In these 15 years, we have witnessed communism's decline, the liberation of Eastern Europe, the destruction of the Berlin Wall and a rebirth of liberty worldwide.
wavs/reagan_1994_016.wav|I know young America's foundation was active in those efforts and I congratulate you on your vigilance.
wavs/reagan_1994_017.wav|I know too that you have since turned your efforts to reforming our campuses.
wavs/reagan_1994_018.wav|Your work is needed as much now as it was when you inaugurated your conferences.
wavs/reagan_1994_019.wav|Today, political correctness has replaced pro-Marxist ideas as the conventional wisdom on too many campuses.
wavs/reagan_1994_020.wav|The sharpest weapons in this new struggle are a razor-sharp wit and well-honed disdain for intellectual intolerance.
wavs/reagan_1994_021.wav|I consider it a tragedy that at some campuses, those who hold unfashionable ideas are hooded off the stage or dented a forum in the marketplace.
wavs/reagan_1994_022.wav|What a distortion of the great chaotic yet essential marketplace of ideas.
wavs/reagan_1994_023.wav|I urge you to continue your work to ensure that our campuses become a true marketplace of ideas.
wavs/reagan_1994_024.wav|Freedom would not have come to Eastern Europe without the perseverance of many beleaguered freedom fighters.
wavs/reagan_1994_025.wav|And intellectual balance and fair play will only return to our campuses because you are willing to stand up to those who would subvert them for some narrow ideological purpose.
wavs/reagan_1994_026.wav|Young America's foundation has been a refuge for students seeking an alternative to the politically correct environment enforced on many campuses.
wavs/reagan_1994_027.wav|I know the conference will send you back to your campuses better, informed, motivated, and trained.
wavs/reagan_1994_028.wav|Your work is vital to the future of the nation.
wavs/reagan_1994_029.wav|Nancy and I congratulate you on your commitment and wish you well in the days ahead.
wavs/reagan_1994_030.wav|Thank you and God bless you.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_001.wav|no hood,
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_002.wav|I'm glad you asked that question because I know it's on many people's minds.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_003.wav|I aborted an investigation.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_004.wav|I know that CIA is already going forward with one.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_005.wav|We have a gentleman down in Nicaragua who is on contract to the CIA advising supposedly on military tactics, the, uh, contrasts.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_006.wav|And he drew up this manual.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_007.wav|It was turned over to the agency head in of the CIA in Nicaragua.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_008.wav|Uh, to be printed and a number of pages were excised by that agency head there, the man in charge.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_009.wav|And he sent it on up here to CIA where more pages were excised before it was printed.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_010.wav|But some way or other, there were 12 of the original copies that got out down there and were not submitted for this printing process by the CIA.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_011.wav|Now those that details as we have them.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_012.wav|And as soon as we have, uh, an investigation and find out where any blame lies for the few that did not get excised or changed, we certainly are going to do something about that.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_013.wav|We'll take the proper action at the proper time.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_014.wav|I was very interested to hear about Central America and our process down there.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_015.wav|And I thought for a moment that instead of a debate, I was going to find Mr. Mondale in complete agreement with what we're doing because the plan that he has outlined is the one we've been following for quite some time.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_016.wav|Including diplomatic processes throughout Central America and working closely with the Contedora group.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_017.wav|So I can only tell you about the manual that we're not in the habit of assigning guilt before there has been proper evidence produced and proof of that guilt.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_018.wav|But if guilt is established, whoever is guilty, we will treat with that situation.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_019.wav|Then.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_020.wav|And they will be removed.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_021.wav|Yes, I have so many things there to respond to.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_022.wav|I'm going to pick out something you said earlier.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_023.wav|You've been all over the country repeating something that I will admit the press has also been repeating that I believe that nuclear missiles could be fired and then called back.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_024.wav|I never ever conceived of such a thing.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_025.wav|I never said any such thing in a discussion of our strategic arms negotiations.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_026.wav|I said that submarines carrying missiles and airplanes carrying.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_027.wav|And they were not just conventional missiles, but more conventional type weapons, not as destabilizing as the land-based missiles.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_028.wav|And that they were all so weapons that or carriers that if they were sent out and there was a change, you could call them back before they had launched their missiles.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_029.wav|But I hope that from here on, you will no longer be saying that particular thing, which is absolutely false, how anyone could think that any sane person would believe you could call back a nuclear missile.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_030.wav|I think is as ridiculous as the as the whole concept has been.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_031.wav|So thank you for giving me a chance to straighten the record.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_032.wav|I'm sure that you appreciate that.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_033.wav|I have said a number of occasions exactly what I believe about the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_034.wav|I retract nothing that I have said.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_035.wav|I believe that many of the things they have done are evil in any concept of morality that we have.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_036.wav|But I also recognize that as the two great superpowers in the world, we have to live with each other.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_037.wav|And I told Mr. Grameco, we don't like their system, they don't like ours.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_038.wav|And we're not going to change their system and they sure better not try to change ours.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_039.wav|But between us, we can either destroy the world or we can save it.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_040.wav|And I suggested that certainly it was to their common interest along with ours to avoid a conflict and to attempt to save the world and remove the nuclear weapons.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_041.wav|And I think that perhaps we established a little better understanding.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_042.wav|I think that in dealing with the Soviet Union, one has to be realistic.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_043.wav|I know that Mr. Mondale in the past has made statements as if they were just people like ourselves and if we were kind and good and did something nice, they would respond accordingly.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_044.wav|And the result was unilateral disarmament.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_045.wav|We canceled the B1 under the previous administration.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_046.wav|What did we get for it?
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_047.wav|Nothing.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_048.wav|The Soviet Union has been engaged in the biggest military build up in the history of man.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_049.wav|At the same time that we tried the policy of unilateral disarmament, of weakness, if you will.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_050.wav|And now we are putting up a defense of our own and I've made it very plain to them.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_051.wav|We seek no superiority.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_052.wav|We simply are going to provide a deterrent so that it would be too costly for them if they are nursing any ideas of aggression against us.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_053.wav|Now they claim they are not.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_054.wav|And I made it plain to them.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_055.wav|We are not.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_056.wav|But this, there's been no change in my attitude at all.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_057.wav|I just thought when I came into office, it was time that there was some realistic talk to and about the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_058.wav|And we did get their attention.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_059.wav|Now you've added a hypothetical there at the end to Cal.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_060.wav|About that where we would send troops into fight.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_061.wav|I am not going to make the decisions to what the tactics could be.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_062.wav|But obviously there are a number of areas in the world that are of importance to us.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_063.wav|Because one is the Middle East.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_064.wav|And that is of interest to the whole Western world and the industrialized nations because of the great supply of energy on which so many depend there.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_065.wav|The, our neighbors here in America are vital to us.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_066.wav|We are working right now and trying to be of help in the southern Africa, with regard to the independence of Namibia and the removal of the Cuban surrogates, the thousands of them.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_067.wav|From Angola.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_068.wav|So I can say there are a great many interest.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_069.wav|I believe that we have a great interest in the Pacific Basin.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_070.wav|That is where I think the future of the world lies.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_071.wav|But I am not going to pick out one and in advance hypothetically say, oh yes, we would send troops there.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_072.wav|Yes, I am not going to continue trying to respond to these repetitions of the falsehoods that have already been stated here.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_073.wav|But with regard to whether Mr. Mondale would be strong as he said he would be, I know that he has a commercial out where he is appearing on the deck of the Nimitz and watching the F-14s take off.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_074.wav|And that is an image of strength.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_075.wav|Except that if he had had his way when the Nimitz was being planned, he would have been deep in the water out there because there wouldn't have been any Nimitz to stand on.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_076.wav|He was against it.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_077.wav|He was against the F-14 fighter.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_078.wav|He was against the M-1 tank.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_079.wav|He was against the B-1 bomber.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_080.wav|He wanted to cut the salary of the all of the military.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_081.wav|He wanted to bring home half of the American forces in Europe.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_082.wav|And he has a record of weakness with regard to our national defense that is second to none.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_083.wav|Indeed, he was on that side virtually throughout all his years in the Senate.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_084.wav|But Andy opposed even the President Carter when toward the end of his term President Carter wanted to increase the defense budget.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_085.wav|No more than I don't agree to all of those things.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_086.wav|First of all, when we and our allies, the Italians, the French and the United Kingdom went into Lebanon, we went in there at the request of what was left of the Lebanese government.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_087.wav|But to be a stabilizing force while they tried to establish a government, but to first, pardon me, the first time we went in, we went in at their request because the war was going on right in Beirut between Israel and the PLO terrorists.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_088.wav|Israel could not be blamed for that.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_089.wav|Those terrorists had been violating their northern border consistently and Israel chased them all the way to there.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_090.wav|Then we went in with the multinational force to help remove and did remove more than 13,000 of those terrorists from Lebanon.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_091.wav|We departed and then the government of Lebanon asked us back in as a stabilizing force while they established a government and sought to get the foreign forces all the way out of Lebanon and that they could then take care of their own borders.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_092.wav|And we were succeeding.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_093.wav|We were there for the better part of a year.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_094.wav|Our position happened to be at the airport.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_095.wav|All of the were occasional snipings and sometimes some artillery fire.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_096.wav|But we did not engage in conflict that was out of line with our mission.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_097.wav|I will never send troops anywhere in a mission of that kind.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_098.wav|Without telling them that if somebody shoots at them, they can darn well shoot back.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_099.wav|And this is what we did.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_100.wav|We never initiated any kind of action.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_101.wav|We defended ourselves there.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_102.wav|But we were succeeding to the point that the Lebanese government had been organized.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_103.wav|If you remember there were the meetings in Geneva in which they began to meet with the hostile, factual forces and try to put together some kind of a peace plan.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_104.wav|We were succeeding and that was why the terrorist acts began.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_105.wav|There are forces there and that includes Syria in my mind who don't want us to succeed, who don't want that kind of a peace with a dominant Lebanon, dominant over its own territory.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_106.wav|And so the terrorist acts began and led to the one great tragedy when they were killed in that suicide bombing the building.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_107.wav|Then the multilateral force withdrew for only one reason.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_108.wav|We withdrew because we were no longer able to carry out the mission for which we had been sent in.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_109.wav|But we went in in the interest of peace and to keep Israel and Syria from getting into the sixth war between them.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_110.wav|And I have no apologies for our going on a peace mission.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_111.wav|Morton, no.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_112.wav|I think there's a great difference between the government of Iran threatening our diplomatic personnel.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_113.wav|And there is a government that you can see and can put your hand on.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_114.wav|In the terrorist situation, there are terrorist factions all over in a recent 30-day period.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_115.wav|37 terrorist acts in 20 countries have been committed.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_116.wav|The most recent has been the one in Brighton.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_117.wav|In dealing with terrorist, yes, we want to retaliate.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_118.wav|But only if we can put our finger on the people responsible and not endanger the lives of innocent civilians there in the various communities and in the city of Beirut, where these terrorists are operating.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_119.wav|I have just signed legislation to add to our ability to deal along with our allies with this terrorist problem.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_120.wav|And it's going to take all the nations together just as when we banded together, we pretty much resolved the whole problem of hijack, sky jackings some time ago.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_121.wav|Well, the red light went on.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_122.wav|I could have gone on forever.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_123.wav|Yes, this had to do with our dishonorment talks.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_124.wav|And the whole controversy about land missiles came up because we thought that the strategic nuclear weapons, the most destabilizing of the land base, you put your thumb and a button and somebody blows up 20 minutes later.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_125.wav|So we thought that it would be simpler to negotiate first with those and then we made it plain a second phase take up the submarine launched the airborne missiles.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_126.wav|The Soviet Union, to our surprise and not just mine, made it plain when we brought this up that they placed they thought a greater reliance on the land based missiles.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_127.wav|And therefore they wanted to take up all three and we agreed we said all right if that's what you want to do.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_128.wav|But it was a surprise to us because they outnumbered us 64 to 36 and submarines and 20% more bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles than we had.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_129.wav|So why should we believe that they had placed that much real more reliance on land based.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_130.wav|But even after we gave in and said all right, let's discuss it all.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_131.wav|They walked away from the table.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_132.wav|We didn't.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_133.wav|Yes, I know to come as a surprise Mr. Mondale, but I am in charge.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_134.wav|And as a matter of fact, we haven't avoided arms control talks with the Soviet Union very early in my administration.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_135.wav|I proposed and I think something that had never been proposed by any previous administration.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_136.wav|I proposed a total elimination of intermediate range missiles where the Soviets had better than a ton and still have better than a 10 to 1 advantage over the Allies in Europe.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_137.wav|When they protested that and suggested a smaller number perhaps I went along with that.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_138.wav|The so-called negotiation that you said I walked out on was the so-called walk in the wood between one of our representatives and one of the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_139.wav|And it wasn't me that turned it down the Soviet Union dis about it.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_140.wav|And we believe me supported the Simpson-Mazoli bill strongly and the bill that came out of the Senate.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_141.wav|However, there were things added in the House side that we felt made it less of a good bill as a matter of fact made it a bad bill.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_142.wav|And in conference we stayed with them in conference all the way to where even Senator Simpson did not want the bill in the manner in which it would come out of the conference committee.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_143.wav|There were a number of things in there that we can that bill I can't go into detail about them here.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_144.wav|But it is true our borders are out of control.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_145.wav|It is also true that this has been a situation in our borders back through a number of administrations.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_146.wav|And I supported this bill.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_147.wav|I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here even though some time back they may have entered illegally.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_148.wav|With regard to the employer sanctions this we must have that not only to ensure that we can identify the illegal aliens but also while some keep protesting about what it would do to employers.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_149.wav|There is another employer that we shouldn't be so concerned about.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_150.wav|And these are employers down through the years who have encouraged the illegal entry into this country because they then hire these individuals and hire them as starvation wages.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_151.wav|And with none of the benefits that we think are normal and natural for workers in our country.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_152.wav|And the individuals can't complain because of their illegal status.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_153.wav|We don't think that those people should be allowed to continue operating free.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_154.wav|And this was why the provisions that we had in with regard to sanctions and so forth.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_155.wav|And I'm going to do everything I can and all of us in the administration are to join in again when Congress is back at it to get an immigration bill that will give us once again control of our borders.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_156.wav|And with regard to friendship below the border and with the countries down there, yes, no administration that I know has established the relationship that we have with our Latin friends.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_157.wav|But as long as they have an economy that leaves so many people in dire poverty and unemployment they are going to seek that employment across our borders and we work with those other countries.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_158.wav|No, as a matter of fact the population explosion, if you look at the actual figures has been vastly exaggerated.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_159.wav|Over exaggerated as a matter of fact there are some pretty scientific and solid figures about how much space there still is in the world and how many more people we can have.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_160.wav|But it's almost like going back to the Malthusian theory when even then they were saying that everyone would starve with the limited population they had then.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_161.wav|But the problem of population growth is one here with regard to our immigration and we have been the safety valve whether we wanted to or not with the illegal entry here in Mexico where their population is increasing and they don't have an economy that can absorb them and provide the jobs.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_162.wav|And this is what we're trying to work out not only to protect our own borders but to have some kind of fairness and recognition of that problem.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_163.wav|Come, I think what has been hailed as something I'm supposedly as President discussing as principal is the re-tval of just some philosophical discussions with people who interested in the same things and that is the prophecies down through the years, the biblical prophecies of what would portend the coming of Armageddon and so forth and the fact that a number of theologians for the last decade or more.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_164.wav|Have believed that this was true that the prophecies are coming together that portend that but no one knows whether Armageddon those prophecies mean that Armageddon is a thousand years away or day after tomorrow.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_165.wav|So I have never seriously warned and said we must plan according to Armageddon.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_166.wav|Now with regard to having to say whether we would try to survive in the event of a nuclear war of course we would but let me also point out that to several parliaments around the world in Europe and in Asia, I have made a statement and eat to each one of them and I'll repeat it here.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_167.wav|A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought and that is why we are maintaining a deterrent and trying to achieve a deterrent capacity to where no one would believe that they could start such a war and escape with limited damage but the deterrent and that's what it is for is also what led me to propose what is now being called the threat of the war.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_168.wav|It's not the Star Wars concept but proposed that we research to see if there isn't a defensive weapon that could defend against incoming missiles and if such a defense could be found wouldn't it be far more humanitarian to say that now we can defend against a nuclear war by destroying missiles instead of slaughtering millions of people.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_169.wav|Why not?
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_170.wav|What if we did and I hope we can we're still researching what if we come up with a weapon that renders those missiles obsolete there has never been a weapon invented in the history of man that has not led to a defensive a counter weapon but suppose we came up with that.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_171.wav|Now some people have said that would make it war imminent because they would think that we could not launch a first strike because we could defend against the enemy but why not do what I have offered to do and ask the Soviet Union to do.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_172.wav|Say look here's what we can do we'll even give it to you now will you sit down with us and once and for all get rid all of us of these nuclear weapons and free mankind from that threat.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_173.wav|I think that would be the greatest use of a defensive weapon.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_174.wav|Morton
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_175.wav|I did criticize the president because of our undercutting of what was a stalwart ally the Shah of Iran and I am not at all convinced that he was that far out of line with his people or that they wanted that to happen.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_176.wav|The Shah had done our bidding and carried our load in the Middle East for quite some time and I did think that it was a blot on our record that we let him down have things gotten better.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_177.wav|The Shah whatever he might have done was building low cost housing had taken land away from the mullism was distributing it to the peasants so they could be landowners things of that kind.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_178.wav|But we turned it over to a maniacal fanatic who has slaughtered thousands and thousands of people calling it executions.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_179.wav|The matter of Samoza no I never defended Samoza and as a matter of fact the previous administration stood by and so did I not that I could have done anything in my position at that time.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_180.wav|But for this revolution to take place and the promise of the revolution was democracy human rights free labor unions free press and then just as Castro had done in Cuba the Sandinistas ousted the other parties to the revolution.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_181.wav|Many of them are now the Contras they exiled some they jailed some they murdered some and they installed a Marxist Leninist totalitarian government.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_182.wav|And what I have to say about this is many times and this has to do with the Philippines also I know there are things there in the Philippines that do not look good to us from the standpoint right now of democratic rights.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_183.wav|But what is the alternative it is a large communist movement to take over the Philippines they have been our friend for since their inception as a nation.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_184.wav|And I think that we've had enough of a record of letting under the guise of revolution someone that we thought was a little more right than we would be letting that person go and then winding up with totalitarianism pure and simple as the alternative.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_185.wav|And I think that we're better off for example with the Philippines of trying to retain our friendship and help them write the wrongs we see rather than throwing the wolves and then facing a communist power in the Pacific.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_186.wav|Mr. President since the United States has two strategically important bases in the Philippines would the overthrow of President Marcos constitute a threat to vital American interests and if so what would you do about it.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_187.wav|Well as I say we have to look at what an overthrow there would mean and what the government would be that would follow and there is every evidence every indication that that government would be hostile to the United States and that would be a severe blow to the to our abilities there in the Pacific.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_188.wav|To the panelists the moderator and to the people of Kansas City for their warm hospitality and greeting I think the American people tonight have much to be grateful for an economic recovery that has become expansion freedom and most of all we are at peace.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_189.wav|I am grateful for the chance to reaffirm my commitment to reduce nuclear weapons and one day to eliminate them entirely.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_190.wav|The question before you comes down to this.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_191.wav|Do you want to see America return to the policies of weakness of the last four years or do we want to go forward marching together as a nation of strength.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_192.wav|And that's going to continue to be strong.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_193.wav|The we shouldn't be dwelling on the past or even the present the meaning of this election is the future and whether we're going to grow and provide the jobs and the opportunities for all Americans and that they need.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_194.wav|Several years ago I was given an assignment to write a letter.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_195.wav|It was to go into a time capsule and would be read in a hundred years when that time capsule was opened.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_196.wav|I remember driving down the California coast one day my mind was full of what I was going to put in that letter about the problems and the issues that confront us in our time and what we did about them.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_197.wav|But I couldn't completely neglect the beauty around me the Pacific out there in one side of the highway shining in the sun like the mountains of the coast range rising on the other side.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_198.wav|And I found myself wondering what it would be like for someone wondering if someone a hundred years from now would be driving down that highway and if they would see the same thing.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_199.wav|And with that thought I realized what a job I had with that letter.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_200.wav|I would be writing a letter to people who know everything there is to know about us.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_201.wav|We know nothing about them.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_202.wav|They would know all about our problems.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_203.wav|They would know how we solve them and whether our solution was beneficial to them down through the years or whether it hurt them.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_204.wav|They would also know that we lived in a world with terrible weapons, nuclear weapons, terrible destructive power aimed at each other, capable of crossing the ocean in a matter of minutes and destroying civilization as we know it.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_205.wav|And then I thought to myself what are they going to say about us?
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_206.wav|What are those people a hundred years from now going to think?
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_207.wav|They will know whether we use those weapons or not.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_208.wav|Well what they will say about us a hundred years from now depends on how we keep our rendezvous with destiny.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_209.wav|Will we do the things that we know must be done and know that one day down in history, a hundred years or perhaps before someone will say thank God for those people back in the 1980s for preserving our freedom for saving for us this blessed planet called Earth with all its grandeur and its beauty.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_210.wav|You know I am grateful to all of you for giving me the opportunity to serve you for these four years and I seek reelection because I want more than anything else to try to complete the new beginning that we charted four years ago.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_211.wav|George Bush, who I think is one of the finest vice presidents this country has ever had.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_212.wav|George Bush and I have crossed the country and we've had in these last few months a wonderful experience.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_213.wav|We have met young America.
wavs/reagan_1988_11_11_001.wav|those who live today remember those who do not and those who know freedom
wavs/reagan_1988_11_11_002.wav|remember today
wavs/reagan_1988_11_11_003.wav|those who gave up life for freedom
wavs/reagan_1988_11_11_004.wav|today in honor of the dead
wavs/reagan_1988_11_11_005.wav|we conduct ceremonies
wavs/reagan_1988_11_11_006.wav|we lay reads
wavs/reagan_1988_11_11_007.wav|we speak words of tribute and in our memories in our hearts we hold them close to us still yet we also know even as their families knew when they last looked upon them but they can never be fully ours again that they belong now to God and to that for which they so selflessly made a final and eternal act of devotion
wavs/reagan_1988_11_11_008.wav|we could not forget them even if they were not our own
wavs/reagan_1988_11_11_009.wav|we could not forget them for all time they are what we can only aspire to be giving, unselfish, the epitome of human love to lay down one's life so that others might live we think on their lives we think on their final moments in our minds
wavs/reagan_1988_11_11_010.wav|I we see young Americans in a European forest or on an Asian island or at sea or in aerial combat and as life expired we know that those who could had last thoughts of us and of their love for us as they thought of as them so too we think of them now with love with devotion and with faith the certainty that what they died for was worthy of their sacrifice faith too in God and in the nation that has pledged itself to his work and to the dream of human freedom and a nation too that today and always pledges itself to their eternal memory thank you God bless you
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_001.wav|my fellow Americans,
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_002.wav|the scenes that the whole world witnessed this past weekend were among the most heart-rending in the long nightmare of Lebanon's agony.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_003.wav|millions of us have seen pictures of the Palestinian victims of this tragedy.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_004.wav|there's little that words can add, but there are actions we can and must take to bring that nightmare to an end.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_005.wav|it's not enough for us to view this as some remote event in which we ourselves are not involved.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_006.wav|for our friends in Lebanon and Israel,
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_007.wav|for our friends in Europe and elsewhere in the Middle East, and for us as Americans.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_008.wav|this tragedy, horrible as it is, reminds us of the absolute imperative of bringing peace to that troubled country in region.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_009.wav|by working for peace in the Middle East, we serve the cause of world peace and the future of mankind.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_010.wav|for the criminals who did this deed, no punishment is enough to remove the blot of their crime.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_011.wav|but for the rest of us, there are things that we can learn and things that we must do.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_012.wav|the people of Lebanon must have learned that the cycle of massacre upon massacre must end.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_013.wav|children are not avenged by the murder of other children.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_014.wav|Israel must have learned that there is no way it can impose its own solutions on hatreds as deep and bitter as those that produce this tragedy.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_015.wav|if it seeks to do so, it will only sink more deeply into the quagmire that looms before it.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_016.wav|those outsiders who have fed the flames of civil war in Lebanon for so many years need to learn that the fire will consume them too if it is not put out.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_017.wav|and we must all rededicate ourselves to the cause of peace.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_018.wav|I re-emphasize my call for early progress to solve the Palestinian issue and repeat the U.S. proposals which are now even more urgent.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_019.wav|for now is not the time for talk alone.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_020.wav|now is the time for action to act together to restore peace to Beirut, to help a stable government emerge that can restore peace and independence to all of Lebanon, and to bring a just and lasting resolution to the conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbors, one that satisfies the legitimate rights of the Palestinians who are all too often its victims.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_021.wav|our basic objectives in Lebanon have not changed for they are the objectives of the government and the people of Lebanon themselves.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_022.wav|first and foremost, we seek the restoration of a strong and stable central government in that country, brought into being by orderly constitutional processes.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_023.wav|Lebanon elected a new president two short weeks ago only to see him murdered even before he could assume his office.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_024.wav|this week a distressed Lebanon will again be electing a new president.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_025.wav|may God grant him safety as well as the wisdom encouraged to lead his country into a new and happer area.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_026.wav|the international community has an obligation to assist the government of Lebanon in reasserting authority over all its territory.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_027.wav|foreign forces and armed factions have too long obstructed the legitimate role of the government of Lebanon's security forces.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_028.wav|we must pave the way for withdrawal of foreign forces.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_029.wav|the place to begin this task is in Beirut.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_030.wav|the Lebanese government must be permitted to restore internal security in its capital.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_031.wav|it cannot do this if foreign forces remain in or near Beirut.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_032.wav|with this goal in mind, I have consulted with our French and Italian allies.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_033.wav|we have agreed to form a new multinational force similar to the one which served so well last month.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_034.wav|with the mission of enabling the Lebanese government to resume full sovereignty over its capital.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_035.wav|the essential precondition for extending its control over the entire country.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_036.wav|the Lebanese government with the support of its people requested this help.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_037.wav|for this multinational force to succeed, it is essential that Israel withdraw from Beirut.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_038.wav|with the expected cooperation of all parties, the multinational force will return to Beirut for a limited period of time.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_039.wav|its purpose is not to act as a police force, but to make it possible for the lawful authorities of Lebanon to discharge those duties for themselves.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_040.wav|secretary Schultz on my behalf has also reiterated our views to the government of Israel through its ambassador in Washington.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_041.wav|unless Israel moves quickly and courageously to withdraw, it will find itself ever more deeply involved in problems that are not its own and which it cannot solve.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_042.wav|the participation of American forces in Beirut will again be for a limited period.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_043.wav|but I have concluded there is no alternative to their returning to Lebanon if that country is to have a chance to stand on its own feet.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_044.wav|peace in Beirut is only a first step.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_045.wav|together with the people of Lebanon, we seek the removal of all foreign military forces from that country.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_046.wav|the departure of all foreign forces at the request of the Lebanese authorities has been widely endorsed by everyone.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_047.wav|and the Arab as well as other states.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_048.wav|Israel and Syria have both indicated that they have no territorial ambitions in Lebanon and are prepared to withdraw.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_049.wav|it is now urgent that specific arrangements for withdrawal of all foreign forces be agreed upon.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_050.wav|this must happen very soon.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_051.wav|the legitimate security concerns of neighboring states, including particularly the safety of Israel's northern population, must be provided for.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_052.wav|but this is not a difficult task if the political will is there.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_053.wav|the Lebanese people must be allowed to chart their own future.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_054.wav|they must rely solely on Lebanese armed forces who are willing and able to bring security to their country.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_055.wav|they must be allowed to do so and the sooner the better.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_056.wav|Ambassador Draper, who has been in close consultation with the parties concerned in Lebanon, will remain in the area to work for the full implementation of our proposal.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_057.wav|Ambassador Habib will join him, will represent me at the inauguration of the new president of Lebanon, and will consult with the leaders in the area.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_058.wav|he will return promptly to Washington to report to me.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_059.wav|early in the summer, our government met its responsibility to help resolve a severe crisis and to relieve the Lebanese people of the crushing burden.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_060.wav|we succeeded.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_061.wav|recent events have produced new problems, and we must again assume our responsibility.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_062.wav|I am especially anxious to end the agony of Lebanon because it is both right and in our national interest.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_063.wav|but I'm also determined to press ahead in the broader effort to achieve peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_064.wav|the events in Beirut of last week have served only to reinforce my conviction that such a peace is desperately needed and that the initiative we undertook on September 1st is the right way to proceed.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_065.wav|we will not be discouraged or deterred in our efforts to seek peace in Lebanon and adjust and lasting peace throughout them at least.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_066.wav|all of us must learn the appropriate lessons from this tragedy and assume the responsibilities that it imposes upon us.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_067.wav|we owe it to ourselves and to our children.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_068.wav|the whole world will be a safer place when this region which is known so much trouble can begin to no peace instead.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_069.wav|both our purpose and our actions are peaceful and we're taking them in a spirit of international cooperation.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_070.wav|so tonight, I ask for your prayers and your support as our country continues its vital role as a leader for world peace.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_071.wav|a role that all of us as Americans can be proud of.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_001.wav|Mr. Secretary General,
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_002.wav|Mr. President,
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_003.wav|Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen,
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_004.wav|I speak today as both a citizen of the United States and of the world.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_005.wav|I come with a heartfelt wishes of my people for peace, bearing honest proposals and looking for genuine progress.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_006.wav|Dag Hammershold said 24 years ago this month, we meet in a time of peace which is no peace.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_007.wav|His words are as true today as they were then.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_008.wav|More than a hundred disputes have disturbed the peace among nations since World War II, and today the threat of nuclear disaster hangs over the lives of all our people.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_009.wav|The Bible tells us there will be a time for peace, but so far this century mankind has failed to find it.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_010.wav|The United Nations is dedicated to world peace, and its charter clearly prohibits the international use of force.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_011.wav|Yet the tide of belligerence continues to rise.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_012.wav|The charter's influence has weakened even in the four years since the first special session on disarmament.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_013.wav|We must not only condemn aggression, we must enforce the dictates of our charter and resume the struggle for peace.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_014.wav|The record of history is clear, citizens of the United States resort to force reluctantly and only when they must.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_015.wav|Our foreign policy, as President Eisenhower once said, is not difficult to state.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_016.wav|We are for peace, first, last and always for very simple reasons.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_017.wav|We know that only in a peaceful atmosphere, a peace with justice, one in which we can be confident can America prosper as we have known prosperity in the past, he said.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_018.wav|He said to those who challenged the truth of those words, let me point out at the end of World War II, we were the only undamaged industrial power in the world.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_019.wav|Our military supremacy was unquestioned.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_020.wav|We had harnessed the atom and had the ability to unleash its destructive poverse anywhere in the world.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_021.wav|In short, we could have achieved world domination, but that was contrary to the character of our people.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_022.wav|Instead, we wrote a new chapter in the history of mankind.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_023.wav|We used our power and wealth to rebuild the war-ravaged economies of the world, both east and west, including those nations who had been our enemies.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_024.wav|We took the initiative in creating such international institutions as this United Nations, where leaders of good will could come together to build bridges for peace and prosperity.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_025.wav|America has no territorial ambitions.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_026.wav|We occupy no countries, and we have built no walls to lock our people in.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_027.wav|Our commitment to self-determination, freedom and peace is the very soul of America.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_028.wav|That commitment is as strong today as it ever was.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_029.wav|The United States has fought four wars in my lifetime.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_030.wav|In each, we struggled to defend freedom and democracy.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_031.wav|We were never the aggressors.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_032.wav|America's strength and, yes, her military power have been a force for peace, not conquest, for democracy, not despotism, for freedom, not tyranny.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_033.wav|Watching as I have succeeding generations of American youth bleed their lives on the far-flung battlefields to protect our ideals and secure the rule of law, I have known how important it is to deter conflict.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_034.wav|But since coming to the presidency, the enormity of the responsibility of this office has made my commitment even deeper.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_035.wav|I believe that responsibility is shared by all of us here today.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_036.wav|On our recent trip to Europe, my wife Nancy told me of a bronze statue, 22 feet high, that she saw on a cliff on the coast of France.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_037.wav|The beach at the base of that cliff is called San Laurent.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_038.wav|But countless American family bibles have written it in the fly leaf and know it as Omaha Beach.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_039.wav|The pastoral quiet of that French countryside is in marked contrast to the bloody violence that took place there on a June day, 38 years ago, when the Allies stormed the continent.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_040.wav|At the end of just one day of battle, 10,500 Americans were wounded, missing or killed in what became known as the Normandy Landing.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_041.wav|The statue atop that cliff is called the Spirit of American Youth Rising From the Waves.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_042.wav|Its image of sacrifice is almost too powerful to describe.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_043.wav|The pain of war is still vivid in our national memory.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_044.wav|It sends me to this special session of the United Nations eager to comply with the plea of Pope Paul VI when he spoke in this chamber nearly 17 years ago.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_045.wav|If you want to be brothers, his holiness said, let the arms fall from your hands.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_046.wav|Will we Americans yearn to let them go?
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_047.wav|But we need more than mere words, more than empty promises before we can proceed.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_048.wav|We look around the world and see rampant conflict and aggression.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_049.wav|There are many sources of this conflict, expansionist ambitions, local rivalries, the striving to obtain justice and security.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_050.wav|We must all work to resolve such discord by peaceful means and to prevent them from escalation.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_051.wav|In the nuclear era, the major powers bear a special responsibility to ease these sources of conflict and to refrain from aggression.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_052.wav|And that's why we're so deeply concerned by Soviet conduct.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_053.wav|Since World War II, the record of tyranny has included Soviet violation of the Yalta agreements leading to domination of Eastern Europe, symbolized by the Berlin Wall, a grim, gray monument to repression that I visited just a week ago.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_054.wav|It includes the takeovers of Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Afghanistan and the ruthless repression of the proud people of Poland.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_055.wav|Soviet-sponsored guerrillas and terrorists are at work in central and South America, in Africa, the Middle East, in the Caribbean and in Europe, violating human rights and unnerving the world with violence.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_056.wav|Commonest atrocities in Southeast Asia, Afghanistan and elsewhere continue to shock the free world as refugees escape to tell of their horror.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_057.wav|The decade of so-called detente witnessed the most massive Soviet build-up of military power in history.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_058.wav|They increased their defense spending by 40 percent, while American defense actually declined in the same real terms.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_059.wav|Soviet aggression and support for violence around the world, if you wrote it, the confidence needed for arms negotiations.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_060.wav|While we exercise unilateral restraint, they forged ahead and today possess nuclear and conventional forces far in excess of an adequate deterrent capability.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_061.wav|Soviet oppression is not limited to the countries they invade.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_062.wav|At the very time, the Soviet Union is trying to manipulate the peace movement in the West.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_063.wav|It is stifling a budding peace movement at home.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_064.wav|In Moscow, banners are scuttled, buttons are snatched and demonstrators are arrested, when even a few people dare to speak about their fears.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_065.wav|Eleanor Roosevelt, one of our first ambassadors to this body, reminded us that the high-sounding words of tyrants stand in bleak contradiction to their deeds.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_066.wav|Their promises, she said, are in deep contrast to their performances.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_067.wav|My country learned a bitter lesson in this century.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_068.wav|The scourge of tyranny cannot be stopped with words alone.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_069.wav|So we have embarked on an effort to renew our strength that had fallen dangerously low.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_070.wav|We refuse to become weaker while potential adversaries remain committed to their imperialist adventures.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_071.wav|My people have sent me here today to speak for them as citizens of the world which they truly are.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_072.wav|For them, every nationality represented in this chamber today.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_073.wav|We understand that men and women of every race and creed can and must work together for peace.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_074.wav|We stand ready to take the next steps down the road of cooperation through verifiable arms reduction.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_075.wav|Agreements on arms control and disarmament can be useful in reinforcing peace, but they're not magic.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_076.wav|We should not confuse the signing of agreements with the solving of problems.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_077.wav|Simply collecting agreements will not bring peace.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_078.wav|Agreements genuinely reinforce peace only when they are kept.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_079.wav|Otherwise, we're building a paper castle that will be blown away by the winds of war.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_080.wav|Let me repeat, we need deeds, not words, to convince us of Soviet sincerity should they choose to join us on this path.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_081.wav|Since the end of World War II, the United States has been the leader in serious disarmament and arms control proposals.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_082.wav|In 1946, in what became known as the Baruch plan, the United States submitted a proposal for control of nuclear weapons and nuclear energy by an international authority.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_083.wav|The Soviets rejected this plan.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_084.wav|In 1955, President Eisenhower made his open skies proposal under which the United States and the Soviet Union would have exchanged blueprints of military establishments and provided for aerial reconnaissance.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_085.wav|The Soviets rejected this plan.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_086.wav|In 1963, the limited test band treaty came into force.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_087.wav|This treaty ended nuclear weapons testing in the atmosphere, outer space, or underwater by participating nations.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_088.wav|In 1970, the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons took effect.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_089.wav|The United States played a major role in this key effort to prevent the spread of nuclear explosives and to provide for international safeguards on civil nuclear activities.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_090.wav|My country remains deeply committed to those objectives today and to strengthening the non-proliferation framework.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_091.wav|This is essential to international security.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_092.wav|In the early 1970s, again, at United States urging agreements were reached between the United States and the USSR, providing for ceilings on some categories of weapons.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_093.wav|They could have been more meaningful if Soviet actions had shown restraint and commitment to stability at lower levels of force.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_094.wav|The United Nations designated the 1970s as the first disarmament decade, but good intentions were not enough.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_095.wav|In reality, that 10-year period included an unprecedented build-up in military weapons and the flaring of aggression and use of force in almost every region of the world.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_096.wav|We are now in the second disarmament decade.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_097.wav|The task at hand is to assure civilized behavior among nations, to unite behind an agenda of peace.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_098.wav|Over the past seven months, the United States has put forward a broad-based comprehensive series of proposals to reduce the risk of war.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_099.wav|We have proposed four major points as an agenda for peace, elimination of land-based intermediate-range missiles, a one-third reduction in strategic ballistic missile warheads, a substantial reduction in NATO and Warsaw-Pact ground and air forces, and new safeguards to reduce the risk of accidental war.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_100.wav|We urge the Soviet Union to date a join with us in this quest.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_101.wav|We must act not for ourselves alone, but for all mankind.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_102.wav|On November 18th of last year, I announced United States objectives in arms control agreements.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_103.wav|They must be equitable and militarily significant.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_104.wav|They must stabilize forces at lower levels, and they must be verifiable.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_105.wav|The United States and its allies have made specific, reasonable and equitable proposals.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_106.wav|In February, our negotiating team in Geneva offered the Soviet Union a draft treaty on intermediate-range nuclear forces.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_107.wav|We offered to cancel deployment of our perishing two ballistic missiles and ground-launched cruise missiles in exchange for Soviet elimination of the SS-20, SS-4, and SS-5 missiles.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_108.wav|This proposal would eliminate with one stroke those systems about which both sides have expressed the greatest concern.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_109.wav|The United States is also looking forward to beginning negotiations on strategic arms reductions with the Soviet Union in less than two weeks.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_110.wav|We will work hard to make these talks an opportunity for real progress in our quest for peace.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_111.wav|On May 9th, I announced a phased approach to the reduction of strategic arms.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_112.wav|In a first phase, the number of ballistic missile warheads on each side would be reduced to about 5,000.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_113.wav|No more than half the remaining warheads would be on land-based missiles.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_114.wav|All ballistic missiles would be reduced to an equal level at about one half the current United States number.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_115.wav|In the second phase, we would reduce each side's overall destructive power to equal levels, including a mutual ceiling on ballistic missile throw weight below the current U.S. level.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_116.wav|We are also prepared to discuss other elements of the strategic balance.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_117.wav|Before I return from Europe last week, I met in bond with the leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_118.wav|We agreed to introduce a major new Western initiative for the Vienna Negotiations on Mutual-Balanced Force Reductions.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_119.wav|Our approach calls for common collective ceilings for both NATO and the Warsaw Treaty Organization.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_120.wav|After seven years, there would be a total of 700,000 ground forces and 900,000 ground and air force personnel combined.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_121.wav|It also includes a package of associated measures to encourage cooperation and verify compliance.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_122.wav|We urge the Soviet Union and members of the Warsaw Pact to view our Western proposal as a means to reach agreement in Vienna after nine long years of inconclusive talks.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_123.wav|We also urge them to implement the 1975 Helsinki Agreement on security and cooperation in Europe.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_124.wav|Let me stress that for agreements to work, both sides must be able to verify compliance.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_125.wav|The building of mutual confidence in compliance can only be achieved through greater openness.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_126.wav|I encourage the special session on disarmament to endorse the importance of these principles in arms control agreements.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_127.wav|I have instructed our representatives at the 40 Nation Committee on Disarmament to renew emphasis on verification and compliance.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_128.wav|Based on a U.S. proposal, a committee has been formed to examine these issues as they relate to restrictions on nuclear testing.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_129.wav|We are also pressing the need for effective verification provisions in agreements banning chemical weapons.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_130.wav|The use of chemical and biological weapons has long been viewed with revulsion by civilized nations.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_131.wav|No peace-making institution can ignore the use of those dread weapons and still live up to its mission.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_132.wav|The need for a truly effective and verifiable chemical weapons agreement has been highlighted by recent events.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_133.wav|The Soviet Union, the RALIs, are violating the Geneva Protocol of 1925, related rules of international law and the 1972 biological weapons convention.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_134.wav|There is conclusive evidence that the Soviet government has provided toxins for use in Laos and Campuchia and are themselves using chemical weapons against freedom fighters in Afghanistan.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_135.wav|We have repeatedly protested to the Soviet government as well as to the governments of Laos and Vietnam, their use of chemical and toxin weapons.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_136.wav|We call upon them now to grant full and free access to their countries or to territories they control so that United Nations experts can conduct an effective, independent, indivestigation to verify cessation of these horrors.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_137.wav|Evidence of noncompliance with existing arms control agreements underscores the need to approach negotiation of any new agreements with care.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_138.wav|The democracies of the West are open societies.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_139.wav|Information in our defenses is available to our citizens, our elected officials, and the world.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_140.wav|We do not hesitate to inform potential adversaries of our military forces and ask and return for the same information concerning theirs.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_141.wav|The amount and type of military spending by a country is important for the world to know as a measure of its intentions and the threat that country may pose to its neighbors.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_142.wav|The Soviet Union and other closed societies go to extraordinary lengths to hide their true military spending not only from other nations but from their own people.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_143.wav|This practice contributes to distrust and fear about their intentions.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_144.wav|Today, the United States proposes an international conference on military expenditures to build on the work of this body and developing a common system for accounting and reporting.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_145.wav|We urge the Soviet Union in particular to join this effort in good faith, to revise the universally discredited official figures it publishes, and to join with us in giving the world a true account of the resources we allocate to our armed forces.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_146.wav|Last Friday in Berlin, I said that I would leave no stone unturned in the effort to reinforce peace and lessen the risk of war.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_147.wav|It's been clear to me, steps should be taken to improve mutual communication, confidence, and lessen the likelihood of misinterpretation.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_148.wav|I have therefore directed the exploration of ways to increase understanding and communication between the United States and the Soviet Union in times of peace and of crisis.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_149.wav|We would approach the Soviet Union with proposals for reciprocal exchanges in such areas as advance notification of major strategic exercises that otherwise might be misinterpreted, advance notification of ICBM launches within as well as beyond national boundaries, and an accepted, banded exchange of strategic forces data.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_150.wav|While substantial information on U.S. activities and forces in these areas already is provided, I believe that jointly and regularly sharing information would represent a qualitative improvement in the strategic nuclear environment and would help reduce the chance of misunderstandings.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_151.wav|I call upon the Soviet Union to join the United States in exploring these possibilities to build confidence, and I ask for your support of our efforts.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_152.wav|One of the major items before this conference is the development of a comprehensive program of disarmament.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_153.wav|We support the effort to chart a course of realistic and effective measures in the quest for peace.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_154.wav|I have come to this hall to call for international recommitment to the basic tenet of the United Nations charter that all members practice tolerance and live together in peace as good neighbors under the rule of law for saking armed force as a means of settling disputes between nations.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_155.wav|America urges you to support the agenda for peace that I have outlined today.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_156.wav|We ask you to reinforce the bilateral and multilateral arms control negotiations between members of NATO and the Warsaw Pact and to re-dedicate yourselves to maintaining international peace and security and removing threats to peace.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_157.wav|We who have signed the UN Charter have pledged to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territory or independence of any state.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_158.wav|In these times, when more and more lawless acts are going unpunished, as some members of this very body show a growing disregard for the UN Charter, the peace-loving nations of the world must condemn aggression and pledge again to act in a way that is worthy of the ideals that we have endorsed.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_159.wav|Let us finally make the charter live.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_160.wav|In late spring, 37 years ago, representatives of 50 nations gathered on the other side of this continent in the San Francisco Opera House.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_161.wav|The League of Nations had crumbled, and World War Two still raged, but those men and nations were determined to find peace.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_162.wav|The result was this charter for peace, that is, the framework of the United Nations.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_163.wav|President Harry Truman spoke of the revival of an old faith.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_164.wav|He said the everlasting moral force of justice, prompting that United Nations conference such a force remains strong in America and in other countries where speech is free, and citizens have the right to gather and make their opinions known.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_165.wav|And President Truman said, if we should pay merely lip service to inspiring ideals and later do violence to simple justice, we would draw down upon us the bitter wrath of generations yet unborn.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_166.wav|Those words of Harry Truman have special meaning for us today as we live with the potential to destroy civilization.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_167.wav|We must learn to live together in peace, he said.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_168.wav|We must build a new world, a far better world.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_169.wav|What a better world it would be if the guns were silent, if neighbor no longer encroached on neighbor, and all peoples were free to reap the rewards of their toil and determine their own destiny and system of government, whatever their choice.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_170.wav|During my recent audience with his holiness Pope John Paul II, I gave him the pledge of the American people to do everything possible for peace, and arms reduction.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_171.wav|The American people believe forging real and lasting peace to be their sacred trust.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_172.wav|But as never forget that such a peace would be a terrible hoax if the world were known.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_001.wav|I didn't tend to make some remarks about the problem of social security tonight, but the immediacy of congressional action on the tax program, a key component of our economic package has to take priority.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_002.wav|Let me just say, however, I've been deeply disturbed by the way those of you who are dependent on social security have been needlessly frightened by some of the inaccuracies which have been given wide circulation.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_003.wav|It's true that the social security system has financial problems.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_004.wav|It's also true that these financial problems have been building for more than 20 years and nothing has been done.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_005.wav|I hope to address you on this entire subject in the near future.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_006.wav|In the meantime, let me just say this, I stated during the campaign and I repeat now, I will not stand by and see those of you who are dependent on social security deprived of the benefits you've worked so hard to earn.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_007.wav|I make that pledge to you as your president.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_008.wav|You have no reason to be frightened.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_009.wav|You will continue to receive your checks in the full amount do you.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_010.wav|In any plan to restore fiscal integrity of social security, I personally will see that the plan will not be at the expense of you who are now dependent on your monthly social security checks.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_011.wav|Now, let us turn to the business at hand.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_012.wav|He's been nearly six months since I first reported to you on the state of the nation's economy.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_013.wav|I'm afraid my message that night was grim and disturbing.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_014.wav|I remember telling you we were in the worst economic mess since the Great Depression.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_015.wav|Prices were continuing to spiral upward.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_016.wav|Unemployment was reaching in tolerable levels and all because government was too big and spent too much of our money.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_017.wav|We're still not out of the woods, but we've made a start.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_018.wav|And we've certainly surprised those long time and somewhat cynical observers of the Washington scene who looked, listened and said, it can never be done.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_019.wav|Washington will never change its spending habits.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_020.wav|Well, something very exciting has been happening here in Washington and you are responsible.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_021.wav|Your voices have been heard.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_022.wav|Millions of you, Democrats, Republicans and Independents from every profession, trade and line of work and from every part of this land.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_023.wav|You sent a message that you wanted a new beginning.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_024.wav|You wanted to change one little, two little word, tattoo letter word, I should say.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_025.wav|It doesn't sound like much, but it sure can make a difference changing by government, control by government to control of government.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_026.wav|In that earlier broadcast, you recall I proposed a program to drastically cut back government spending in the 1982 budget, which begins October 1st and to continue cutting in the 83 and 84 budgets.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_027.wav|Along with this, I suggested and across the board tax cuts spread over those same three years and the elimination of unnecessary regulations, which were adding billions to the cost of things we buy.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_028.wav|All-alobbing, the organized demonstrations and the cries of protest by those whose way of life depends on maintaining government's wasteful ways were no match for your voices, which were heard loud and clear in these marble halls of government.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_029.wav|And you made history with your telegrams, your letters, your phone calls and yes, personal visits to talk to your elected representatives.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_030.wav|You reaffirmed the mandate you delivered in the election last November, a mandate that called for an end to government policies that sent prices and mortgage rate skyrocketing while millions of Americans went jobless.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_031.wav|Because of what you did, Republicans and Democrats in the Congress came together and passed them with sweeping cutbacks in the history of the federal budget.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_032.wav|Right now, members of the House and Senate are meeting in a conference committee to reconcile the differences between the two budget cutting bills passed by the House and Senate.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_033.wav|When they finish, all Americans will benefit from savings of approximately $140 billion in reduced government costs over just the next three years.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_034.wav|And that doesn't include the additional savings from the hundreds of burdensome regulations already canceled for facing cancellation.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_035.wav|For 19 out of the last 20 years, the federal government has spent more than it took in.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_036.wav|There will be another large deficit in this present year which ends September 30th.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_037.wav|But with our program in place, it won't be quite as big as it might have been.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_038.wav|And starting next year, the deficits will get smaller until in just a few years, the budget can be balanced.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_039.wav|And we hope we can begin whittling at that almost $1 trillion debt that hangs over the future of our children.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_040.wav|Now, so far, I've been talking about only one part of our program for economic recovery, the budget cutting part.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_041.wav|I don't minimize its importance.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_042.wav|Just the fact that Democrats and Republicans could work together as they have proving the strength of our system has created an optimism in our land.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_043.wav|The rate of inflation is no longer in double digit figures.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_044.wav|The dollar has regained strength in the international money markets and business men and investors are making decisions with regard to industrial development, modernization and expansion.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_045.wav|All of this based on anticipation of our program being adopted and put into operation.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_046.wav|A recent poll shows that we're a year and a half ago, only 24% of our people believe things would get better.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_047.wav|Today, 46% believe they will.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_048.wav|To justify their fate, we must deliver the other part of our program.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_049.wav|Our economic packages are closely nit-carefully constructed plan to restore America's economic strength and put our nation back on the road to prosperity.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_050.wav|Each part of this package is vital.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_051.wav|It cannot be considered piecemeal.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_052.wav|It was proposed as a package and it has been supported as such by the American people.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_053.wav|Only if the Congress passes all of its major components does it have any real chance of success.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_054.wav|This is absolutely essential.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_055.wav|If we're to provide incentives and make capital available for the increased productivity required to provide real permanent jobs for our people.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_056.wav|And let us not forget that the rest of the world is watching America carefully to see how we lack at this critical moment.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_057.wav|I've recently returned from a summit meeting with world leaders in Ottawa, Canada and the message I heard from them was quite clear.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_058.wav|Our allies depend on a strong and economically sound America and their watching events in this country, particularly those surrounding our program for economic recovery with close attention and great hopes.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_059.wav|In short, the best way to have a strong foreign policy of growing is to have a strong economy at home.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_060.wav|Now the day after tomorrow, Wednesday, the House of Representatives will begin debate on two tax bells and once again they need to hear from you.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_061.wav|I know that doesn't give you much time, but a great deal is at stake.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_062.wav|A few days ago I was disted here in the office by a Democratic congressman from one of our southern states.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_063.wav|He'd been back in his district and one day one of his constituents asked him where he stood on our economic recovery program.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_064.wav|I outlined that program in an earlier broadcast, particularly the tax cut.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_065.wav|Well, the congressman who happens to be a strong leader in support of our program replied at some length with a discussion of the technical points involved, but he also mentioned a few reservations he had on certain points.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_066.wav|The constituent, a farmer, listened politely until he'd finished and then he said, don't give me an essay.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_067.wav|What I want to know is, are you forum or again him?
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_068.wav|Well, I appreciate the gentleman's support and suggest his questions and message your own representative should hear.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_069.wav|Let me add, those representatives honestly and sincerely want to know your feelings.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_070.wav|They get plenty of input from the special interest groups.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_071.wav|They'd like to hear from their home folks.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_072.wav|Now, let me explain what the situation is and what's it issue.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_073.wav|With our budget cuts, we presented a complete program of reduction in tax rates.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_074.wav|Again, our purpose was to provide incentive for the individual, incentives for business to encourage production and hiring of the unemployed and to free up money for investment.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_075.wav|Our bill calls for a 5% reduction in the income tax rates by October 1st, a 10% reduction beginning July 1st, 1982, and another 10% cut a year later, a 25% total reduction over three years.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_076.wav|But then to ensure the tax cut is permanent, we call for indexing the tax rates in 1985 which means adjusting them for inflation.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_077.wav|As it is now, if you get a cost of living, raise that's intended to keep you even with inflation, you find that the increase in the number of dollars you get may very likely move you into a higher tax bracket and you wind up poorer than you were.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_078.wav|This is called bracket creep.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_079.wav|A bracket creep is in city's tax.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_080.wav|Let me give an example.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_081.wav|If you earned $10,000 a year in 1972, by 1980, you had to earn $19,700 just to stay even with inflation.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_082.wav|But that's before taxes.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_001.wav|Well thank you and welcome to the White House.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_002.wav|In a moment, I'll be sitting at that desk, taking up a pen and signing the most sweeping overhaul of tax code in our nation's history.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_003.wav|To all of you here today who've worked so long and hard to see this day come, my thanks and the thanks of a nation go out to you.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_004.wav|The journey's been long and many said we'd never make it to the end, but as usual, the pessimist left one thing out out of their calculations, the American people.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_005.wav|They haven't made this the freest country in the mightiest economic force on this planet by shrinking from challenges.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_006.wav|They never gave up and after almost three years of commitment and hard work, one headline in the Washington Post told the whole story.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_007.wav|The impossible became the inevitable and the dream of America's fair share tax plan became a reality.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_008.wav|When I signed this bill into law, America will have the lowest marginal tax rates and the most modern tax code among major industrialized nations, one that encourages risk-taking, innovation and that old American spirit of enterprise.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_009.wav|We'll be refueling the American growth economy with the kind of incentives that help create record-new businesses and nearly 11.7 million jobs in just 46 months.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_010.wav|Fair and simpler for most Americans, this is a tax code designed to take us into a future of technological invention and economic achievement, one that will keep America competitive and growing into the 21st century.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_011.wav|But for all tax reforms economic benefits, I believe that history will record this moment as something more as the return to the first principles.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_012.wav|This country was founded on faith in the individual, not groups or classes, but faith in the resources and bounty of each and every separate human soul.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_013.wav|Our founding fathers designed a democratic form of government to enlist the individual's energies and fashioned a bill of rights to protect its freedoms.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_014.wav|And in so doing, they tapped a spring of hope and creativity that was to completely transform history.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_015.wav|The history of these United States of America is indeed a history of individual achievement.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_016.wav|It was their hard work that built our cities and farmed our prairies, their genius that continually pushed us beyond the boundaries of existing knowledge, reshaping our world with the steam engine, polio vaccine and the silicon chip.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_017.wav|It was their faith in freedom and love of country that sustained us through trials and hardships and through wars.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_018.wav|And it was their courage and selflessness that enabled us to always prevail.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_019.wav|But when our founding fathers designed this government of by and for the people, they never imagined what we've come to know as the progressive income tax.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_020.wav|When the income tax was first levied in 1913, the top rate was only 7% on people with incomes over $500,000.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_021.wav|Now that's the equivalent of multi-millionaires today.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_022.wav|But in our lifetime, we've seen marginal tax rates skyrocket as high as 90% and not even the poor have been spared.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_023.wav|As tax rates escalated, the tax code grew ever more tangled and complex, a haven for special interest in tax manipulators, but an impossible frustration for everybody else.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_024.wav|Blatantly unfair, our tax code became a source of bitterness and discouragement for the average taxpayer.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_025.wav|It wasn't too much to call it un-American.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_026.wav|Meanwhile, the steeply progressive nature of the tax struck at the heart of the economic life of the individual, punishing that special effort and extra hard work that has always been the driving force of our economy.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_027.wav|As governments hunger for ever more revenues expanded, families saw tax cuts or taxes, I should say, cut deeper and deeper into their paychecks.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_028.wav|And taxation fell most cruelly on the poor, making a difficult climb up from poverty even harder.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_029.wav|Throughout history, the oppressive hand of government has fallen most heavily on the economic life of the individuals.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_030.wav|And more often than not, it is inflation and taxes that have undermined livelihoods and constrained their freedoms.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_031.wav|We should not forget that this nation of ours began in a revolt against oppressive taxation.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_032.wav|Our founding fathers fought not only for our political rights, but also to secure the economic freedoms without which these political freedoms are no more than a shadow.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_033.wav|In the last 20 years, we've witnessed an expansion and strengthening of many of our civil liberties, but our economic liberties have too often been neglected and even abused.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_034.wav|We protect the freedom of expression of the author as we should.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_035.wav|But what are the freedom of expression of the entrepreneur whose pen and paper are capital and profits whose book may be a new invention or small business?
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_036.wav|What are the creators of our economic life whose contributions may not only delight the mind, but improve the condition of man by feeding the poor with new grains, bringing hope to the sick with new cures, vanishing ignorance with wondrous new information technologies.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_037.wav|And what about fairness for families?
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_038.wav|It's in our families that America's most important work gets done, raising our next generation.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_039.wav|But over the last 40 years, as inflation has shrunk the personal exemption, families with children have had to shoulder more and more of the tax burden.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_040.wav|With inflation and bracket creep also eroding incomes, many spouses who would rather stay home with their children have been forced to go looking for jobs.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_041.wav|And what of America's promise of hope and opportunity that with hard work even the poorest among us can gain the security and happiness that is the due of all Americans.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_042.wav|You can't put a price tag on the American dream.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_043.wav|That dream is the heart and soul of America.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_044.wav|It's the promise that keeps our nation forever good, and generous, a model and hope to the world.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_045.wav|For all these reasons, this tax bill is less of freedom or a reform, I should say, than a revolution.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_046.wav|Millions of working poor will be dropped from the tax rolls altogether, and families will get a long overdue break with lower rates and an almost double personal exemption.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_047.wav|We're going to make it economical to raise children again.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_048.wav|Flatter rates will mean more reward for that extra effort and vanishing loopholes and a minimum tax will mean that everybody and every corporation pay their fair share.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_049.wav|And that's why I'm certain that the bill I'm signing today is not only an historic overhaul of our tax code and a sweeping victory for fairness.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_050.wav|It's also the best anti-poverty bill, the best pro-family measure, and the best job creation program ever to come out of the Congress of the United States.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_051.wav|And I'll oppose with all my might any attempt to raise tax rates on the American people, and I hope that all here will join with me to make permanent.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_052.wav|That ever didn't start here in Washington, but began with the many thinkers who have struggled to return economics to its classical roots, to an understanding that ultimately the economy is not made up of aggregates like government spending and consumer demand, but of individual men and women, each striving to provide for his family and better his or her lot in life.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_053.wav|But we must also salute those courageous leaders in the Congress who've made this day possible.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_054.wav|To Bob Pachwood, Dan Rostyn Kowski, Russell Long, John Duncan, and Majority Leader Bob Dole,
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_055.wav|to Jack Camp Bob Caston, Bill Bradley, Dick Gephart, who pioneered with their own versions of tax reform.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_056.wav|I salute all you and all the other members of the Senate and House whose efforts paid off and whose votes finally won the day, who most often have felt that they were fighting a lonely battle against overwhelming odds, particularly my two incomparable secretaries of the Treasury, Don Regan, and Jim Baker.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_057.wav|I feel like we've just played the world series of tax reform and the American people won.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_001.wav|well, thank you, director Lagoonoff, and I want to thank all of you very much, or a very warm welcome.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_002.wav|It's a great pleasure to be here at Moscow State University, and I want to thank you all for turning out.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_003.wav|I know you must be very busy this week, studying and taking your final examinations, so let me just say, but she too says hello and wishes you all good luck.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_004.wav|Let me say it's also a great pleasure to once again have this opportunity to speak directly to the people of the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_005.wav|Before I left Washington, I received many heartfelt letters and telegrams asking me to carry here a simple message, perhaps but also one of the most important business of this summit.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_006.wav|It is a message of peace and goodwill and hope for a growing friendship and closeness between our two peoples.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_007.wav|As you know, I've come to Moscow to meet with one of your most distinguished graduates.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_008.wav|In this our fourth summit, General Secretary Gorbachev and I have spent many hours together, and I feel that we're getting to know each other well.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_009.wav|Our discussions, of course, have been focused primarily on many of the important issues of the day.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_010.wav|Issues I want to touch on with you in a few moments.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_011.wav|But first, I want to take a little time to talk to you, much as I would to any group of university students in the United States.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_012.wav|I want to talk not just of the realities of today, but of the possibilities of tomorrow.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_013.wav|Standing here before a mural of your revolution, I want to talk about a very different revolution that is taking place right now, quietly sweeping the globe without bloodshed or conflict.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_014.wav|It's effects are peaceful, but they will fundamentally alter our world, shatter old assumptions and reshape our lives.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_015.wav|It's easy to underestimate because it's not accompanied by banners or fanfare.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_016.wav|It's been called the technological or information revolution.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_017.wav|And as its emblem, one might take the tiny silicon chip.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_018.wav|No bigger than a fingerprint.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_019.wav|One of these chips has more computing power than a room full of old-style computers.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_020.wav|As part of an exchange program, we now have an exhibition touring your country that shows how information technology is transforming our lives, replacing manual labor with robots, forecasting weather for farmers, or mapping the genetic code of DNA for medical researchers.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_021.wav|These micro computers today aid the design of everything from houses to cars to spacecraft.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_022.wav|They even design better and faster computers.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_023.wav|They can translate English into Russian or enable the blind to read or help Michael Jackson produce on one synthesizer the sounds of a whole orchestra.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_024.wav|Linked by a network of satellites and fiber optic cables, one individual with a desktop computer and a telephone, commands resources unavailable to the largest governments just a few years ago.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_025.wav|Like a chrysalis, we're emerging from the economy of the industrial revolution.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_026.wav|An economy confined to and limited by the Earth's physical resources into, as one economist titled his book, The Economy In Mind, in which there are no bounds on human imagination.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_027.wav|And the freedom to create is the most precious, natural resource.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_028.wav|Think of that little computer chip.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_029.wav|Its value wasn't in the sand from which it is made, but in the microscopic architecture designed into it by ingenious human minds, or take the example of the satellite, relaying this broadcast around the world, which replaces thousands of tons of copper mined from the Earth and molded into wire.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_030.wav|In the new economy, human invention increasingly makes physical resources obsolete.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_031.wav|We're breaking through the material conditions of existence to a world where man creates his own destiny.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_032.wav|Even as we explore the most advanced reaches of science, we're returning to the age-old wisdom of our culture, a wisdom contained in the book of the Genesis in the Bible.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_033.wav|In the beginning was the Spirit, and it was from this Spirit that the material abundance of creation issued forth.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_034.wav|But progress is not foreordained.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_035.wav|The key is freedom, freedom of thought, freedom of information, freedom of communication.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_036.wav|The renowned scientist, scholar, and founding father of this university, Mikhail Loma-Nosef knew that.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_037.wav|It is common knowledge, he said, that the achievements of science are considerable and rapid, particularly once the yoke of slavery is cast off and replaced by the freedom of philosophy.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_038.wav|You know, one of the first contacts between your country and mine took place between Russian and American explorers.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_039.wav|The Americans were members of Cook's last voyage on an expedition searching for an Arctic passage.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_040.wav|On the island of Unalaska, they came upon the Russians who took them in and together with the native inhabitants held a prayer service on the ice.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_041.wav|The explorers of the modern era are the entrepreneurs, men with vision, with a courage to take risks and faith enough to brave the unknown.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_042.wav|These entrepreneurs and their small enterprises are responsible for almost all the economic growth in the United States.

wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_044.wav|In fact, one of the largest personal computer firms in the United States was started by two college students, no older than you, in the garage behind their home.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_045.wav|Some people, even in my own country, look at the riot of experiment that is the free market and see only waste.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_046.wav|What of all the entrepreneurs that fail?
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_047.wav|Well, many do, particularly the successful ones, often several times.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_048.wav|And if you ask them the secret of their success, they'll tell you it's all that they learned in their struggles along the way.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_049.wav|Yes, it's what they learned from failing, like an athlete in competition or a scholar in pursuit of the truth.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_050.wav|Experience is the greatest teacher.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_051.wav|And that's why it's so hard for government planners, no matter how sophisticated to ever substitute for millions of individuals working night and day to make their dreams come true.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_052.wav|The fact is bureaucracies are a problem around the world.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_053.wav|There's an old story about a town that could be anywhere with a bureaucrat who was known to be a good for nothing, but he somehow would always hung on to power.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_054.wav|So one day in a town meeting an old woman got up and said to him, there is a folk legend here where I come from that when a baby is born, an angel comes down from heaven and kisses it on one part of its body.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_055.wav|If the angel kisses him on his hand, he becomes a handyman.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_056.wav|If he kisses him on his forehead, he becomes bright and clever.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_057.wav|And I've been trying to figure out where the angel kissed you so that you should sit there for so long and do nothing.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_058.wav|We are seeing the power of economic freedom spreading around the world, places such as the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan have vaulted into the technological era, barely pausing in the industrial age along the way.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_059.wav|Low-tax agricultural policies in the subcontinent mean that in some years India is now a next-a-net exporter of food, perhaps most exciting of the winds of chains that are blowing over the people's Republic of China, where one quarter the world's population is now getting its first taste of economic freedom.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_060.wav|At the same time, the growth of democracy has become one of the most powerful political movements of our age.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_061.wav|In Latin America in the 1970s, only a third of the population lived under democratic government.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_062.wav|Today, over 90 percent does.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_063.wav|In the Philippines, in the Republic of Korea, free contested democratic elections are the order of the day.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_064.wav|Throughout the world, free markets are the model for growth.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_065.wav|Democracy is the standard by which governments are measured.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_066.wav|We Americans make no secret of our belief in freedom.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_067.wav|In fact, it's something of a national pastime.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_068.wav|Every four years, the American people choose a new president.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_069.wav|And 1988 is one of those years.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_070.wav|At one point, there were 13 major candidates running in the two major parties, not to mention all the others, including the Socialist and Libertarian candidates, all trying to get my job.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_071.wav|About 1,000 local television stations, 8,500 radio stations, and 1,700 daily newspapers, each one an independent private enterprise, fiercely independent of the government, report on the candidates, grill them in interviews, and bring them together for debates.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_072.wav|In the end, the people vote.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_073.wav|They decide who will be the next president.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_074.wav|But freedom doesn't begin or end with elections.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_075.wav|Go to any American town to take just an example.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_076.wav|And you will see dozens of churches representing many different beliefs in many places, synagogues and mosques.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_077.wav|And you will see families of every conceivable nationality worshipping together.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_078.wav|Go into any school room.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_079.wav|And there you will see children being taught the Declaration of Independence that they are endowed by their creator with certain unilionable rights, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, that no government can justly deny.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_080.wav|The guarantees and their constitution for freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of religion, go into any courtroom and there will provide, preside, an independent judge, beholden to no government power.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_081.wav|There, every defendant has the right to a trial by a jury of his peers, usually 12 men and women, common citizens.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_082.wav|They are the ones, the only ones who weigh the evidence and decide on guilt or innocence.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_083.wav|In that court, the accused is innocent until proven guilty.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_084.wav|And the word of a policeman or any official has no greater legal standing than the word of the accused.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_085.wav|Go to any university campus and there you will find an open, sometimes heated discussion of the problems in American society and what can be done to correct them.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_086.wav|Turn on the television and you will see the legislature conducting the business of government right there before the camera, debating and voting on the legislation that will become the law of the land.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_087.wav|March in any demonstration and there are many of them.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_088.wav|The people's right of assembly is guaranteed in the constitution and protected by the police.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_089.wav|Go into any union hall where the members know their right to strike is protected by law.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_090.wav|As a matter of fact, one of the many jobs I had before this one was being president of a union, the screen actors guild.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_091.wav|I led my union out on strike and I'm proud to say we won.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_092.wav|But freedom is more even than this.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_093.wav|Freedom is the right to question and change the established way of doing things.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_094.wav|It is the continuing revolution of the marketplace.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_095.wav|It is the understanding that allows us to recognize shortcomings and seek solutions.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_096.wav|It is the right to put forth an idea scoffed at by the experts and watch it catch fire among the people.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_097.wav|It is the right to stick to dream, to follow your dream or stick to your conscience even if you're the only one in a sea of doubters.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_098.wav|Freedom is the recognition that no single person, no single authority or government has a monopoly on the truth.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_099.wav|But that every individual life is infinitely precious.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_100.wav|That every one of us put on this world has been put there for a reason and has something to offer.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_101.wav|America is a nation made up of hundreds of nationalities.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_102.wav|Our ties to you are more than ones of good feeling.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_103.wav|Their ties of kinship.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_104.wav|In America, you will find Russians, Armenians, Ukrainians, people from Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_105.wav|They come from every part of this vast continent, from every continent to live in harmony, seeking a place where each cultural heritage is respected, each is valued for its diverse strengths and beauties and the richness it brings to our lives.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_106.wav|Recently, a few individuals and families have been allowed to visit relatives in the West.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_107.wav|We can only hope that it won't be long before all are allowed to do so.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_108.wav|And Ukrainian Americans, Baltic Americans, Armenian Americans can freely visit their homelands just as this Irish American visits his.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_109.wav|Freedom, it has been said, makes people selfish and materialistic.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_110.wav|But Americans are one of the most religious peoples on earth because they know that liberty, just as life itself, is not earned.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_111.wav|But a gift from God.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_112.wav|They seek to share that gift with the world.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_113.wav|Reason and experience said George Washington in his farewell address, both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_114.wav|And it is substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary spring of popular government.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_115.wav|Democracy is less a system of government than it is a system to keep government limited, unintrusive, a system of constraints on power to keep politics and government secondary to the important things in life.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_116.wav|The true sources of value found only in family and faith.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_117.wav|But I hope you know I go on about these things not simply to extol the virtues of my own country, but to speak to the true greatness of the heart and soul of your land.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_118.wav|Who after all needs to tell the land of Dastoyevsky about the quest for truth, the home of Kandinsky and Skryabin about imagination, the rich and noble culture of the Uzbek man of letters Ali Sheer, Navoyee about beauty and heart.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_119.wav|The great culture of your diverse land speaks with a glowing passion to all humanity.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_120.wav|Let me cite one of the most eloquent contemporary passages on human freedom.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_121.wav|It comes not from the literature of America, but from this country, from one of the greatest writers of the 20th century.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_122.wav|Boris Pastorne in the novel Dr. Zhivago.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_123.wav|He writes,
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_124.wav|I think that if the beast who sleeps in man could be held down by threats, any kind of threat, whether of jail or of retribution after death, then the highest emblem of humanity would be the lion tamer in the circus with his whip, not the prophet who sacrificed himself.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_125.wav|But this is just the point.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_126.wav|What has for centuries raised man above the beast is not the cudgel, but an inward music, the irresistible power of unarmed truth, the irresistible power of unarmed truth.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_127.wav|Today the world looks expectantly to signs of change, steps toward greater freedom in the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_128.wav|We watch as, and we hope as we see positive changes taking place.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_129.wav|There are some I know in your society who fear that change will bring only disruption and discontinuity, who fear to embrace the hope of the future.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_130.wav|Sometimes it takes faith.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_131.wav|It's like that scene in the cowboy movie, Butch Cassidy in the Sundance Kid, which some here in Moscow recently had a chance to see.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_132.wav|The posse is closing in in the two outlaws, Butch and Sundance, who find themselves trapped on the edge of a cliff with a sheer drop of hundreds of feet to the raging rapids below.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_133.wav|Butch turns to Sundance and says their only hope is to jump into the river below.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_134.wav|But Sundance refuses.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_135.wav|He says he'd rather fight it out with the posse, even though they're hopelessly outnumbered.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_136.wav|Butch says that suicide and urges him to jump.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_137.wav|But Sundance still refuses and finally admits, I can't swim.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_138.wav|Butch breaks up the laughing and says you crazy fool.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_139.wav|The fall will probably kill you.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_140.wav|And by the way, both Butch and Sundance made it.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_141.wav|In case you didn't see the movie.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_142.wav|I think what I've just been talking about is Paris Stryker and what his goals are.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_143.wav|But change would not mean rejection of the past, like a tree growing strong through the seasons, rooted in the earth, and drawing life from the sun.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_144.wav|So too positive change must be rooted in traditional values, in the land, in culture, in family, in community.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_145.wav|And it must take its life from the eternal things, from the source of all life which is faith.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_146.wav|Such change will lead to new understandings, new opportunities, to a broader future in which the tradition is not supplanted, but finds its full flowering.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_147.wav|That is the future beckoning to your generation.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_148.wav|At the same time, we should remember that reform, that is not institutionalized, will always be insecure.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_149.wav|Such freedom will always be looking over its shoulder, a bird on a tether, no matter how long the rope can always be pulled back.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_150.wav|And that is why in my conversation with General Secretary Gorbachev, I have spoken of how important it is to institutionalize change, to put guarantees on reform.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_151.wav|And we have been talking together about one sad reminder of a divided world, the Berlin Wall.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_152.wav|It is time to remove the barriers that keep people apart.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_153.wav|I am proposing an increased exchange program of high school students between our countries.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_154.wav|General Secretary Gorbachev mentioned on Sunday a wonderful phrase you have in Russian for this.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_155.wav|Better to see something once than to hear about it a hundred times.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_156.wav|Mr. Gorbachev and I first began working on this in 1985.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_157.wav|In our discussion today, we agreed on working up to several thousand exchanges a year from each country in the near future.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_158.wav|But not everyone can travel across the continents and oceans.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_159.wav|Words travel lighter.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_160.wav|And that is why we would like to make available to this country more of our 11,000 magazines and periodicals.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_161.wav|And our television and radio shows that can be beamed off a satellite in seconds.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_162.wav|Nothing would please us more than for the Soviet people to get to know us better and to understand our way of life.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_163.wav|Just a few years ago, few would have imagined the progress our two nations have made together.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_164.wav|The INF Treaty, which General Secretary Gorbachev and I signed last December in Washington, and whose instruments of ratification we would exchange tomorrow.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_165.wav|The first true nuclear arms reduction treaty in history, calling for the elimination of an entire class of US and Soviet nuclear missiles.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_166.wav|And just 16 days ago, we saw the beginning of your withdrawal from Afghanistan, which gives us hope that soon the fighting may end and the healing may begin.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_167.wav|And that that suffering country may find self-determination, unity and peace at long last.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_168.wav|It's my fervent hope that our constructive cooperation on these issues will be carried on to address the continuing destruction of conflicts in many regions of the globe.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_169.wav|And that the serious discussions that led to the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan will help lead dissolutions in southern Africa, Ethiopia, Cambodia, the Persian Gulf, and Central America.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_170.wav|I have often said nations do not distrust each other because they are armed. They are armed because they distrust each other.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_171.wav|If this globe is to live in peace and prosper, if it is to embrace all the possibilities of the technological revolution, then nations must renounce once and for all the right to an expansionist foreign policy.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_172.wav|Peace between nations must be an enduring goal, not a tactical stage in a continuing conflict.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_173.wav|I've been told that there's a popular song in your country, perhaps you know it, whose evocative refrain asks the question, do the Russians want a war?
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_174.wav|In answer, it says, go ask that silence lingering in the air above the birch and popular there.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_175.wav|Beneath those trees, the soldiers lie.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_176.wav|Go ask my mother, ask my wife, then you will have to ask no more, do the Russians want a war?
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_177.wav|But what if you're one time allies?
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_178.wav|What if those embraced you on the elder?
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_179.wav|What if we'd asked the watery graves of the Pacific or the European battlefields where America's fallen were buried far from home?
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_180.wav|What if we would ask their mothers, sisters and sons, do Americans want war?
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_181.wav|Ask us too, and you'll find the same answer, the same longing in every heart.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_182.wav|People do not make wars, governments do, and no mother would ever willingly sacrifice her sons for territorial gain, for economic advantage, for ideology.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_183.wav|A people free to choose will always choose peace.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_184.wav|Americans seek always to make friends of old antagonists.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_185.wav|After a colonial revolution with Britain, we have cemented for all ages the ties of kinship between our nations.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_186.wav|After a terrible civil war between North and South, we healed our wounds and found true unity as a nation.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_187.wav|We fought two world wars in my lifetime against Germany and one with Japan.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_188.wav|But now the Federal Republic of Germany and Japan are two of our closest allies and friends.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_189.wav|Some people point to the trade disputes between us as a sign of strain, but they're the frictions of all families and the family of free nations is a big and vital and sometimes boisterous one.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_190.wav|I can tell you that nothing would please my heart more than in my lifetime to see American and Soviet diplomats grappling with the problem of trade disputes between America and a growing exuberant exporting Soviet Union that had opened up to economic freedom and growth.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_191.wav|And as important as these official people to people to exchange is our nothing would please me more than for them to become unnecessary to see travel between east and west become so routine that university students in the Soviet Union could take a month off in the summer and just like students in the west do now, put packs on their backs and travel from country to country in Europe.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_192.wav|And with barely a passport check in between nothing would please me more than to see the day that a concert promoter in say England could call up a Soviet rock group without going through any government agency and have them playing in Liverpool the next night.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_193.wav|Is this just a dream perhaps but it is a dream that is our responsibility to have come true your generation is living in one of the most exciting hopeful times in Soviet history.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_194.wav|It is a time when the first breath of freedom stirs the air and the heart beats to the accelerated rhythm of hope when the accumulated spiritual energies of a long silence yearned to break free.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_195.wav|I am reminded of the famous passage near the end of Goggle's dead soil souls comparing his nation to a speeding trucker.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_196.wav|Goggle asks what will be its destination.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_197.wav|But he writes there was no answer save the bell pouring forth marble of sound.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_198.wav|We do not know what the conclusion of this will be of this journey but we're hopeful that the promise of reform will be fulfilled.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_199.wav|In this Moscow spring this May 1988 we may be allowed that hope that freedom like the fresh green sapling planted over Tolstoy's grave will blossom forth at last in the rich fertile soil of your people and culture.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_200.wav|We may be allowed to hope that the marvelous sound of a new openness will keep rising through ringing through leading to a new world of reconciliation friendship and peace.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_001.wav|I have a plan, not a secret plan, as a matter of fact, it is the economic recovery program that we presented, uh, when I took office in 1981, it is true that earlier working with some very prominent economists, I had come up during the campaign with an economic program that I thought could rectify the great problems confronting us, the double digit inflation, the, um, high tax rates that I think were hurting the economy, the stagflation that we were undergoing, before even the election day, something that none of those economists had even predicted, that happened that the economy was so worsen that I was openly saying that what we had thought in the basis of our plan could have brought a balanced budget, no, that was no longer possible.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_002.wav|So, the plan that we have had and that we're following is a plan that is based on growth in the economy, recovery without inflation, and reducing the share of the, of, that the government is taking from the gross national product, which has become a drag on the economy.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_003.wav|Already, we have a new recovery that has been going on for about 21 months to the point that we can now call an expansion.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_004.wav|Under that, this year, we have seen a 21 billion dollar reduction in the deficit from last year, based mainly on the increased revenues the government is getting without raising tax rates.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_005.wav|Our tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_006.wav|We have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_007.wav|The interest rates have come down about nine or ten points and we think must come down further.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_008.wav|In the last 21 months, more than six million people have gotten jobs.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_009.wav|We thought there have been created new jobs for those people to where there are now 105 million civilians working where there were only 99 million before, 107 if you count the military.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_010.wav|So, we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending, the increase rate of increase in government spending, which has come down from 17 to 6 percent.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_011.wav|And at the same time as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the government gets without raising taxes.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_012.wav|Those two lines will meet and when they meet, that is a balanced budget.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_013.wav|The deficit is a result.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_014.wav|It is the result of excessive government spending.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_015.wav|I do not very frankly take seriously the Congressional Budget Office projections because they have been wrong and virtually all of them, including the fact that our recovery wasn't going to take place to begin with.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_016.wav|But it has taken place.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_017.wav|But as I said, we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_018.wav|If the rate of increase in government spending can be held at 5 percent, we're not far from there.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_019.wav|By 1989, that would have reduced the budget deficits down to a 30 or 40 billion dollar level.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_020.wav|At the same time, if we can have a 4 percent recovery continue through that same period of time, that will mean without an increase in tax rates.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_021.wav|That will mean $400 billion more in government revenues.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_022.wav|And so I think that the lines can meet actually in constant dollars in the domestic side of the budget.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_023.wav|There has been no spending increase in the four years that we have been here.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_024.wav|I don't believe that Mr. Mondale has a plan for balancing the budget.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_025.wav|He has a plan for raising taxes.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_026.wav|As a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history took place in 1977.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_027.wav|And for the five years previous to our taking office, taxes doubled in the United States and the budgets increase $318 billion.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_028.wav|So there is no ratio between taxing and balancing a budget.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_029.wav|Whether you borrow the money or whether you simply tax it away from the people, you're taking the same amount of money out of the private sector, unless and until you bring down government share of what it is taking.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_030.wav|With regard to social security, I hope there will be more time than just this minute to mention that, but I will say this.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_031.wav|A president should never say never, but I'm going to violate that rule and say never.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_032.wav|I will never stand for a reduction of the social security benefits to the people that are now getting them.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_033.wav|Whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor since you've asked it.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_034.wav|Incidentally, I might say that, with regard to the 25% cut social security before I get to the answer to your question, the only 25% cut that I know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase was a cut of 25% in the benefits for every American who was born after 1916.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_035.wav|Now, leadership.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_036.wav|First of all, I think you must have some principles you believe in.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_037.wav|In mine, I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society, that they, not government, are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible with an orderly society.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_038.wav|Now, having that, I think also that in leadership, well, I believe that you find people, positioned such as I'm in, who have the talent and ability to do the things that are needed in the various departments of government.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_039.wav|I don't believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding who's going to play tennis on the White House court.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_040.wav|And you let those people go with the guidelines of overall policy, not looking over their shoulder and nitpicking the manner in which they go at the job.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_041.wav|You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_042.wav|But I also believe something else about that.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_043.wav|I believe that is the right thing to do.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_044.wav|And when I became governor of California, I started this and I continued in this office.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_045.wav|That any issue that comes before me, I have instructed cabinet members and staff.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_046.wav|They are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_047.wav|I don't want to hear them.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_048.wav|I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_049.wav|Is it morally right?
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_050.wav|And on that basis and that basis alone, we make a decision on every issue.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_051.wav|Now, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record to be spoke as possible, taking us back to the same things that we knew on the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they weren't to be ignored, that as matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit would be doubled because they stimulate the economy and help reduce unemployment.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_052.wav|Our policy was not to cut subsidies.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_053.wav|We have believed in partnership and that was an example of a partnership between not only local government and the federal government, but also between the private sector that built that particular structure.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_054.wav|And this is what we've been trying to do is involve the federal government in such partnerships.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_055.wav|We are today subsidizing housing for more than 10 million people.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_056.wav|And we're going to continue along that line.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_057.wav|We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow whether because of age or need.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_058.wav|We have preserved the safety net for the people with true need in this country and it has been pure demagoguery that we have in some way shut off all the charitable programs or many of them for the people who have real need.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_059.wav|The safety net is there and we're taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_060.wav|Well, let me just respond with regard to social security.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_061.wav|When we took office, we discovered that the program that the Carter Mondale administration had said would solve the fiscal problems of social security for the next 50 years wouldn't solve them for five.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_062.wav|Social security was due to go bankrupt before 1983.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_063.wav|Any proposals that I made at that time were at the request of the chairman, a Democrat, of one of the leading committees who said we have to do something before the program goes broke and the checks bounce.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_064.wav|And so we made a proposal.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_065.wav|And then in 1982, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_066.wav|And three days after the election in 1982, they came to us and said social security we know is broke.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_067.wav|Indeed, we had to borrow $17 billion to pay the checks.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_068.wav|And then I asked for a bipartisan commission which I'd asked for from the beginning to sit down and work out a solution.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_069.wav|And so the whole matter of what to do with social security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_070.wav|And it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_071.wav|Well, I was raised to have a faith and a belief and have been a member of the church since I was a small boy.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_072.wav|In our particular church, we did not use that term born again.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_073.wav|So I don't know whether I would fit that particular term.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_074.wav|But I have thanks to my mother, God rest her soul, the firmest possible belief and faith in God.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_075.wav|And I don't believe I believe I should say as Lincoln once said that I could not, I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_076.wav|And I do resort to prayer.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_077.wav|At the same time, however, I have not believed that prayer should be introduced into an election or be a part of a political campaign or religion, a part of that campaign.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_078.wav|As a matter of fact, I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mr. Mondale's running mate said I wasn't a good Christian.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_079.wav|So it does play a part in my life.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_080.wav|I have no hesitancy in saying so.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_081.wav|And as I say, I don't believe that I could carry on unless I had a belief in a higher authority and a belief that prayers are answered.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_082.wav|Yes, it's very difficult to rebut because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr. Mondale.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_083.wav|I too want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_084.wav|The only attacks I have made are on people who apparently would break away at that wall from the government side using the government, using the power of the courts and so forth to hinder that part of the Constitution that says the government shall not only not establish a religion, it shall not inhibit the practice of religion.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_085.wav|And they have been using these things to have government through court orders, inhibit the practice of religion.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_086.wav|A child wants to say grace in its school cafeteria and a court rules that they can't do it.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_087.wav|And because it's school property, these are the types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_088.wav|And I am opposed to that with regard to a platform in the Supreme Court, I can only say one thing about that.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_089.wav|I don't, I have appointed one member of the Supreme Court, Sandra Day O'Connor.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_090.wav|I'll stand in my record on that and if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, I'll do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_091.wav|Mr. Mondale, your rebuttal please.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_092.wav|Well again, I am running on the record.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_093.wav|I think sometimes Mr. Mondale's running away from his.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_094.wav|But I'm running on the record of what we have asked for.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_095.wav|We'll continue to try and get things that we didn't get in the program that has already brought the rate of spending of government down from 17% to 6.1%.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_096.wav|A program of returning authority and autonomy to the local and state governments that has been unjustly seized with the federal government.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_097.wav|And you might find those words in a democratic platform of some years ago, I know because I was a Democrat at that time.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_098.wav|And I left the party eventually because I could no longer follow the turn in the democratic leadership that took us down an entirely different path, a path of centralizing authority in the federal government, lacking trust in the American people.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_099.wav|I promised when we took office that we would reduce inflation, we have to one third of what it was.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_100.wav|I promised that we would reduce taxes.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_101.wav|We did 25% across the board that barely held even with, if it did that much, with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_102.wav|But at least it took that burden away from them.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_103.wav|I said that we would create jobs for our people and we did six million in the last 20 or 21 months.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_104.wav|I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and hopefully an elimination of nuclear weapons.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_105.wav|We have done that.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_106.wav|All of the things that I said we would do from inflation being down, interest rates being down, unemployment falling, all of those things we have done.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_107.wav|And I think this is something the American people see.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_108.wav|I think they also know that we have, we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education, on excellence in education, and today without the federal government being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_109.wav|We find 35 states with task forces now dealing with their educational problems.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_110.wav|We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_111.wav|All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_112.wav|So I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrats saw.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_113.wav|The leadership isn't taking this where we want to go.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_114.wav|There are tasks that government legitimately should enforce and tasks that government performs well and you've named some of them.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_115.wav|Crime has come down the last two years for the first time on many many decades that had just come down or since we've kept records two consecutive years and last year it came down the biggest drop in crime that we've had.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_116.wav|I think that we've had something to do with that just as we have with the drug problem nationwide.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_117.wav|The environment?
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_118.wav|Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_119.wav|When we took office, we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards, lack of safety features that we stopped buying additional park land until we had rectified this with a what was to be a five-year program but it's just about finished already a billion dollars and now we're going back to budgeting for additional lands for our parks.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_120.wav|We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands to the game refuges.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_121.wav|I think that we're out in front of most.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_122.wav|I have believed that in the appointment of judges that all that was specified in the party platform was that they have a they respect the sanctity of human life.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_123.wav|Now that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life but with regard to abortion and I have a feeling that this is there's been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_124.wav|With me abortion is not a problem of religion.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_125.wav|It's a problem of the Constitution.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_126.wav|I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being then that child is already protected by the Constitution which guarantees life liberty and the pursuit of happiness to all of us.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_127.wav|And I think that this is what we should concentrate on is trying I know there was weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_128.wav|There were medical authorities.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_129.wav|There were clerics there.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_130.wav|Everyone talking about this matter of pro-life and at the end of all of that not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_131.wav|We have seen premature births that are now grown up happy people going around.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_132.wav|Also there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_133.wav|In California some time ago a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull and the California state legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then Democratic governor.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_134.wav|Signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_135.wav|Now isn't it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of a unborn child and it was abortion and not murder but if somebody else does it that's murder and it recognizes it used the term death of the unborn child.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_136.wav|So this has been my feeling about abortion that we have a problem now to determine and all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_137.wav|Well with regard to this being a personal choice isn't that what a murderer is insisting on.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_138.wav|Here's her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_139.wav|Now I'm not capable and I don't think you are any of us to make this determination that must be made with regard to human life.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_140.wav|I am simply saying that I believe that that's where the effort should be directed to make that determination.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_141.wav|I don't think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self-defense tradition.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_142.wav|That too would have to be worked out then when you once recognized that we're talking about a life but in this great society of ours wouldn't it make a lot more sense in this gentle and kind society if we had a program that made it possible for when incidents come along and which someone feels they must do away with that unborn child.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_143.wav|That instead we make it available for the adoption there are a million and a half people out there standing in line waiting to adopt children who can't have them any other way.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_144.wav|You know I wasn't going to say this at all but I can't help it and there you go again.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_145.wav|I don't have a plan to tax or increase taxes.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_146.wav|I'm not going to increase taxes.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_147.wav|I can understand why you are Mr. Mondale because as a senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_148.wav|Now I believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertext it's that government has overfed and I think that most of our people this is why we had a 25% tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on them.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_149.wav|And as a matter of fact it just so happens that in the quirks of administering these taxes those above $50,000 actually did not get quite as big a tax cut percentage wise as did those from 50,000 down.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_150.wav|From 50,000 down those people paid two thirds of the taxes and those people got two thirds of the tax cut.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_151.wav|Now the social security tax of 77.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_152.wav|This indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_153.wav|It had two features.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_154.wav|It had several tax increases phased in over a period of time there are two more yet to come between now and eight and 1989.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_155.wav|At the same time every year it increased the amount of money.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_156.wav|Virtually every year there may have been one or two that were skipped in there that was subject to that tax.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_157.wav|Today it is up to about $38,000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for social security.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_158.wav|And that tax there are no deductions so a person making anywhere from 10, 15, they're paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_159.wav|Now I don't think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich and not the other way around it just doesn't work out that way.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_160.wav|The system is the progressivity as I've said and that has not been changed but if you take it in numbers of dollars instead of percentage yes you can say well that person got 10 times as much as this other person yes but he paid 10 times as much also but if you take it in percentages then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_161.wav|Yes I had used last resort would always be with me.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_162.wav|If you got the government down to the lowest level that you yourself could say it could not go any lower and still perform the services for the people and if the recovery was so complete that you knew you were getting the ultimate amount of revenues that you could get through that growth and there was still some slight difference there between those two lines.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_163.wav|Then I had said once that yes you would have to then look to see if taxes should not be adjusted.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_164.wav|I don't foresee those things happening so I say with great confidence I'm not going to go for a tax with regard to a sailing Mr. Bush about his tax problems and the difference from the tax he once paid and then the later tax he paid.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_165.wav|I think if you looked at the deductions there were great legal expenses in there had to do possibly with the sale of his home and they had to do with his setting up of a blind trust all of those are legally deductions deducted deductible in computing your tax and it was a one-year thing with him.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_166.wav|Well some of those facts and figures just don't stand up.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_167.wav|Yes there has been an increase in poverty but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_168.wav|It has begun to decline but it is still going up and the other hand women heads of household, single women heads of household have for the first time there has been a turn down in the rate of poverty for them.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_169.wav|We have found also in our studies that in this increase in poverty it all had to do with their private earnings it had nothing to do with the transfer payments from government the in my way of many programs.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_170.wav|We are spending now 37% more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_171.wav|We are spending a third more on all of the programs of human service.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_172.wav|We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_173.wav|Two million three hundred thousand more are receiving them even though we took 850,000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that wanted their fellow citizens having to support them.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_174.wav|We found people making 185% of the poverty level were getting government benefits.
