wavs/rainbow_001.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_002.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_003.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_004.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_005.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_006.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_007.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_008.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_009.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_010.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_011.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_012.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_013.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_014.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_015.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_016.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_017.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_018.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_019.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_020.wav|Well, here's a story for you: |17|45
wavs/rainbow_021.wav|She was a veterinary nurse who had been working daily at an old zoo in a deserted district of the territory, so she was very happy to start a new job at a superb private practice in north square near the tower.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_022.wav|That area was much nearer for her and more to her liking.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_023.wav|Even so, on her first morning, she felt stressed.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_024.wav|She ate a bowl of porridge, checked herself in the mirror, and washed her face in a hurry.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_025.wav|Then she put on a plain yellow dress and a fleece jacket, picked up her kit and headed for work.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_026.wav|When she got there, there was a woman with a goose waiting for her.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_027.wav|The woman gave her an official letter from the vet.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_028.wav|The letter implied that the animal could be suffering from a rare form of foot and mouth disease, which was surprising, because normally you would only expect to see it in a dog or a goat.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_029.wav|She was sentimental, so this made her feel sorry for the beautiful bird.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_030.wav|Before long, that itchy goose began to strut around the office like a lunatic, which made an unsanitary mess.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_031.wav|The goose's owner, Mary, kept calling, "Comma, Comma," which the vet thought was an odd choice for a name.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_032.wav|Comma was strong and huge, so it would take some force to trap her, but the vet had a different idea.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_033.wav|First she tried gently stroking the goose's lower back with her palm, then singing a tune to her.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_034.wav|Finally, she administered ether.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_035.wav|Her efforts were not futile.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_036.wav|In no time, the goose began to tire, so the vet was able to hold onto her and give her a relaxing bath.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_037.wav|Once she had managed to bathe the goose, she wiped her off with a cloth and laid her on her right side.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_038.wav|Then she confirmed the vet’s diagnosis.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_039.wav|Almost immediately, she remembered an effective treatment that required her to measure out a lot of medicine.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_040.wav|rainbow_040.wav|The vet warned that this course of treatment might be expensive, either five or six times the cost of other medicine.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_041.wav|I can’t imagine paying so much, but Mrs. Harrison, a millionaire lawyer, thought it was a fair price for a cure.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_042.wav|The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, when a traveller came along wrapped in a warm cloak.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_043.wav|They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveller take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_044.wav|Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew the more closely did the traveller fold his cloak around him, and at last the North Wind gave up the attempt.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_045.wav|Then the Sun shone out warmly, and immediately the traveller took off his cloak.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_046.wav|And so the North Wind was obliged to confess that the Sun was the stronger of the two.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_047.wav|Once upon a time there was a rat who couldn't make up his mind.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_048.wav|Whenever the other rats asked him if he would like to come out hunting with them, he would answer in a hoarse voice, "I don't know." |17|45
wavs/rainbow_049.wav|And when they said, "Would you rather stay inside?" he wouldn't say yes, or no either.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_051.wav|He'd always shirk making a choice.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_052.wav|One fine day his aunt Josephine said to him, |17|45
wavs/rainbow_053.wav|"Now look here! No one will ever care for you if you carry on like this. You have no more mind of your own than a greasy old blade of grass!" |17|45
wavs/rainbow_054.wav|The young rat coughed and looked wise, as usual, but said nothing.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_055.wav|"Don't you think so?" said his aunt stamping with her foot, for she couldn't bear to see the young rat so coldblooded.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_057.wav|"I don't know," was all he ever answered, and then he'd walk off to think for an hour or more.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_058.wav|Whether he would stay in his hole in the ground or go out into the loft.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_059.wav|One night the rats heard a loud noise in the loft. It was a very dreary old place.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_061.wav|The roof let the rain come washing in, the beams and rafters had all rotted through, so that the whole thing was quite unsafe.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_062.wav|At last one of the joists gave way, and the beams fell with one edge on the floor.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_063.wav|The walls shook, and the roof fell off, and all the rats' hair stood on end with fear and horror.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_064.wav|"This won't do," said their leader. "We can't stay cooped up here any longer." |17|45
wavs/rainbow_065.wav|So they sent out scouts to search for a new home.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_066.wav|A little later on that evening the scouts came back and said they had found an oldfashioned horse-barn where there would be room and board for all of them.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_067.wav|The leader gave the order at once, "Company fall in!" and the rats crawled out of their holes right away and stood on the floor in a long line.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_070.wav|Just then the old rat caught sight of young Arthur, that was the name of the shirker.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_072.wav|He wasn't in the line, and he wasn't exactly outside it, he stood just by it.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_075.wav|"Come on, get in line!" growled the old rat coarsely. "Of course you're coming too?"|17|45
wavs/rainbow_077.wav|"I don't know," said Arthur calmly.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_078.wav|"Why, the idea of it! You don't think it's safe here any more, do you?"|17|45
wavs/rainbow_079.wav|"I'm not certain," said Arthur undaunted. "The roof may not fall down yet."|17|45
wavs/rainbow_081.wav|"Well," said the old rat, "we can't wait for you to join us."|17|45
wavs/rainbow_082.wav|Then he turned to the others and shouted, "Right about face! March!"|17|45
wavs/rainbow_085.wav|and the long line marched out of the barn while the young rat watched them.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_087.wav|"I think I'll go tomorrow," he said to himself, "but then again, perhaps I won't, it's so nice and snug here. I guess I'll go back to my hole under the log for a while just to make up my mind."|17|45
wavs/rainbow_088.wav|But during the night there was a big crash.Down came beams, rafters, joists, the whole business.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_090.wav|Next morning, it was a foggy day, some men came to look over the damage.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_091.wav|It seemed odd that the old building was not haunted by rats.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_092.wav|But at last one of them happened to move a board, and he caught sight of a young rat, quite dead, half in and half out of his hole.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_093.wav|Thus the shirker got his due, and there was no mourning for him.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_095.wav|You wished to know all about my grandfather.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_096.wav|Well, he is nearly ninety-three years old; he dresses himself in an ancient black frock coat, usually minus several buttons; yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_097.wav|A long, flowing beard clings to his chin, giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_098.wav|When he speaks, his voice is just a bit cracked and quivers a trifle.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_099.wav|Twice each day he plays skilfully and with zest upon our small organ.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_100.wav|Except in the winter when the ooze or snow or ice prevents, he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day.|17|45
wavs/rainbow_101.wav|We have often urged him to walk more and smoke less, but he always answers, “Banana oil!” |17|45
wavs/rainbow_102.wav|Grandfather likes to be modern in his language.|17|45
