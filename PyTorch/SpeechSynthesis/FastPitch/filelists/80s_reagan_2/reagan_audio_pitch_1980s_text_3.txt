mels/reagan_1986_28_1_005.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_28_1_005.pt|This is truly a national loss.

mels/reagan_1986_28_1_015.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_28_1_015.pt|They served all of us.
mels/reagan_1986_28_1_016.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_28_1_016.pt|We've grown used to wonders in this century.
mels/reagan_1986_28_1_017.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_28_1_017.pt|It's hard to dazzle us, but for 25 years the United States space program has been doing just that.
mels/reagan_1986_28_1_018.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_28_1_018.pt|We've grown used to the idea of space and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun.
mels/reagan_1986_28_1_019.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_28_1_019.pt|We're still pioneers.
mels/reagan_1986_28_1_020.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_28_1_020.pt|They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers.
mels/reagan_1986_28_1_021.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_28_1_021.pt|And I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching the live coverage of the Shuttle's takeoff.
mels/reagan_1986_28_1_022.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_28_1_022.pt|I know it's hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen.
mels/reagan_1986_28_1_023.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_28_1_023.pt|It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery.
mels/reagan_1986_28_1_024.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_28_1_024.pt|It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons.

mels/reagan_1986_28_1_027.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_28_1_027.pt|I've always had great faith in and respect for our space program.
mels/reagan_1986_28_1_028.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_28_1_028.pt|And what happened today does nothing to diminish it.
mels/reagan_1986_28_1_029.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_28_1_029.pt|We don't hide our space program.
mels/reagan_1986_28_1_030.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_28_1_030.pt|We don't keep secrets and cover things up.
mels/reagan_1986_28_1_031.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_28_1_031.pt|We do it all up front and didn't public.
mels/reagan_1986_28_1_032.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_28_1_032.pt|That's the way freedom is and we wouldn't change it for a minute.
mels/reagan_1986_28_1_033.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_28_1_033.pt|We'll continue our quest in space.
mels/reagan_1986_28_1_034.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_28_1_034.pt|There would be more Shuttle flights and more Shuttle crews and yes more volunteers, more civilians, more teachers in space.

mels/reagan_1986_28_1_036.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_28_1_036.pt|Our hopes and our journeys continue.
mels/reagan_1986_28_1_038.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_28_1_038.pt|We share it.

mels/reagan_1988_16_12_001.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_001.pt|well thank you very much for that warm welcome.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_005.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_005.pt|The man to whom that mind belongs is known to you as Mr. Jefferson.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_006.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_006.pt|And I think the familiarity of that term is justified.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_007.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_007.pt|His influence here is everywhere.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_009.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_009.pt|The pursuit of science, the study of the great works, the value of free inquiry, in short the very idea of living the life of the mind.

mels/reagan_1988_16_12_012.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_012.pt|Well, you're not alone in feeling his presence.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_013.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_013.pt|Presidents know about this too.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_016.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_016.pt|But it's not just students and presidents.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_017.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_017.pt|It is every American, indeed every human life ever touched with a daring idea of self-government that Mr. Jefferson has influenced.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_018.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_018.pt|Yes, Mr. Jefferson was obliged to admit all previous attempts at popular government, had proven themselves failures.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_024.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_024.pt|He had known personal tragedy, he knew how disorderly a place the world could be.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_025.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_025.pt|Indeed, as a leader of a rebellion, he was himself an architect, if you will, of disorder.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_030.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_030.pt|And I do mean personal experience.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_031.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_031.pt|You see, despite all of George Washington's warnings about the divisiveness of the partisan spirit, federalists and Republicans were constantly at each other in those days.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_032.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_032.pt|The federalists of the Northeast had held power for a long time, and were not anxious to relinquish it.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_034.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_034.pt|We too have seen a new populism in America, not at all unlike that of Jefferson's time.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_037.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_037.pt|It is this latter point that brings me to the University of Virginia today.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_038.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_038.pt|There has been much change in the last eight years in our foreign relations.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_040.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_040.pt|I will not recite all of this here again today, but I do want you to know I found in the delegates afterward a warmth that I had not seen before.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_043.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_043.pt|Only this time is not just a single nation at issue.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_044.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_044.pt|It is the whole world where popular government might flourish and prosper.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_046.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_046.pt|One of the great unnoticed and yet most startling developments of this decade is this.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_047.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_047.pt|More of the world's populace is today living in relative freedom than ever before in history.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_048.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_048.pt|More and more nations are turning to freely elected democratic governments.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_049.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_049.pt|The statistics themselves are compelling.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_052.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_052.pt|The picture is even brighter.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_053.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_053.pt|The most dramatic movement of all has taken place more than 90% of the people are now living in countries that are democratic or headed in that direction.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_054.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_054.pt|This democratic revolution has been accompanied by a change in economic thinking, comparable to the Newtonian revolution in physics.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_055.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_055.pt|That is no accident.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_056.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_056.pt|Free market economies have worked miracles in several nations of East Asia.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_057.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_057.pt|A UN General Assembly Special Session on Africa has called for more market-oriented structural reform in that region.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_061.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_061.pt|These democratic and free market revolutions are really the same revolution.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_062.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_062.pt|They are based on the vital nexus between economic and political freedom, and on the Jeffersonian idea that freedom is indivisible.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_064.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_064.pt|But if this remarkable revolution has not been obvious to many, certainly one other eye-opening change has been self-evident.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_065.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_065.pt|Consider for just a moment the sights we've seen this year.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_066.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_066.pt|An American president with a Soviet counterpart strolling through Red Square and talking to pass-or-by about war and peace.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_070.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_070.pt|But it's not the visuals and the sound bites that matter.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_071.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_071.pt|Behind all of this is a record of diplomatic movement and accomplishment.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_072.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_072.pt|One of those visuals you've seen in the last year is the signing of accords between Mr. Gorbachev and me and the destruction of American and Soviet missiles.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_073.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_073.pt|It was more than just good television, more than just action news.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_074.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_074.pt|The INF Treaty is the first accord in history to eliminate an entire class of US and Soviet nuclear missiles.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_077.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_077.pt|And so too there's progress on nuclear testing agreements and chemical weapons.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_078.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_078.pt|And we're about to begin new negotiations on the conventional balance in Europe.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_080.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_080.pt|Another area where the achievements are visible is that of regional conflicts.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_081.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_081.pt|In Afghanistan, we've seen a settlement leading towards Soviet withdrawal.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_082.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_082.pt|In Cambodia, the first steps have been taken toward withdrawal of Vietnamese troops.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_084.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_084.pt|In the matter of human rights, we've also seen extraordinary progress.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_086.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_086.pt|Some greater scope to publish and speak critically and increase in emigration and visible steps toward greater religious freedom.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_088.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_088.pt|The summits themselves are indications of the progress we've made here.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_090.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_090.pt|Where we're strong, steadfast, we succeed.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_091.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_091.pt|In the Persian Gulf, the United States made clear its commitment to defend freedom of navigation and free world interest.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_092.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_092.pt|And this helped hasten an end to the Gulf War.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_094.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_094.pt|And now that resolve has paid off.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_097.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_097.pt|Here at home a national consensus on the importance of strong American leadership is emerging.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_099.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_099.pt|Now I think much of the reason for all of this has to do with the new coherence and clarity that we brought to our foreign policy.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_101.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_101.pt|The idea of popular government has driven the revival of the West and a renewal of its values and its beliefs in itself.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_102.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_102.pt|But now the question, how do we keep the world moving toward the idea of popular government?
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_104.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_104.pt|First, the Soviet-American relationship, once marked by sterility and confrontation.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_106.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_106.pt|All of this is heady, inspiring, and yet my first reflection for you today is, all of it is still in doubt.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_107.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_107.pt|And the only way to make it last and grow and become permanent is to remember we're not there yet.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_108.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_108.pt|Serious problems, fundamental differences remain.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_109.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_109.pt|Our system is one of checks and balances.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_110.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_110.pt|There's for all its reforms remains a one-party authoritarian system that institutionalizes the concentration of power.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_111.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_111.pt|Our foreign relations embrace this expanding world of democracy that I've described.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_112.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_112.pt|There's can be known by the company they keep.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_113.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_113.pt|Cuba, Nicaragua, Ethiopia, Libya, Vietnam, North Korea.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_115.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_115.pt|So we must keep our heads, and that means keeping our skepticism.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_117.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_117.pt|So this means in our treaty negotiations, as I've said, trust but verify.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_118.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_118.pt|I'm not a linguist, but I learned to say that much Russian and have used it in frequent meetings with Mr. Gorbachev.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_119.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_119.pt|Dover-Yai, no prover-Yai.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_120.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_120.pt|It means keeping our military strong.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_121.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_121.pt|It remains remembering no treaty is better than a bad treaty.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_124.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_124.pt|We must never do that again.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_125.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_125.pt|It's not an act of belligerence to speak to the fundamental differences between totalitarianism and democracy.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_126.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_126.pt|It's a moral imperative.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_127.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_127.pt|It doesn't slow down the pace of negotiations.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_128.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_128.pt|It moves them forward.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_130.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_130.pt|A second reflection I have on all this concerns some recent speculation that what is happening in the Soviet Union was in its way inevitable.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_132.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_132.pt|I think this is wrong.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_133.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_133.pt|It's also dangerous because what we see in the Soviet Union today is a change of a different order than in the past.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_135.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_135.pt|We also saw the construction of the Berlin Wall.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_137.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_137.pt|And let me assure you, Mr. cruise chief gave no speeches at the UN like that recently given by Mr. Gorbachev.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_140.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_140.pt|A greater and greater burden on the peoples of the Soviet Union, on all the peoples of the world.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_141.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_141.pt|Now this is changing.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_142.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_142.pt|How much and how fast it will change we do not know.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_145.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_145.pt|As I suggested in 1982, if the West maintained its strength, we would see economic needs clash with the political order in the Soviet Union.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_146.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_146.pt|This has happened, but it could not have happened if the West had not maintained, indeed strengthened its will, its commitment to world freedom.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_147.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_147.pt|So there was nothing inevitable about all of this.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_148.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_148.pt|Human actions made the difference.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_149.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_149.pt|Mr. Gorbachev has taken some daring steps.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_150.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_150.pt|As I said before, this is the first Soviet leader, not to make world revolution a priority.
mels/reagan_1988_16_12_151.pt|pitch/reagan_1988_16_12_151.pt|Well, let us credit those steps, let us credit him.

mels/reagan_1987_4_3_023.pt|pitch/reagan_1987_4_3_023.pt|First, let me say I take full responsibility for my own actions, and for those of my administration.
mels/reagan_1987_4_3_024.pt|pitch/reagan_1987_4_3_024.pt|As angry as I may be about activities undertaken without my knowledge, I am still accountable for those activities.
mels/reagan_1987_4_3_025.pt|pitch/reagan_1987_4_3_025.pt|As disappointed as I may be in some who serve me, I am still the one who must answer to the American people for this behavior.
mels/reagan_1987_4_3_026.pt|pitch/reagan_1987_4_3_026.pt|And as personally distasteful as I find secret bank accounts and diverted funds, what does the Navy would say?
mels/reagan_1987_4_3_027.pt|pitch/reagan_1987_4_3_027.pt|This happened on my watch.
mels/reagan_1987_4_3_028.pt|pitch/reagan_1987_4_3_028.pt|Let's start with the part that is the most controversial.
mels/reagan_1987_4_3_029.pt|pitch/reagan_1987_4_3_029.pt|A few months ago, I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages.
mels/reagan_1987_4_3_030.pt|pitch/reagan_1987_4_3_030.pt|My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not.
mels/reagan_1987_4_3_032.pt|pitch/reagan_1987_4_3_032.pt|This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind.
mels/reagan_1987_4_3_033.pt|pitch/reagan_1987_4_3_033.pt|There are reasons why it happened, but no excuses.
mels/reagan_1987_4_3_034.pt|pitch/reagan_1987_4_3_034.pt|It was a mistake.
mels/reagan_1987_4_3_035.pt|pitch/reagan_1987_4_3_035.pt|I undertook the original Iran initiative in order to develop relations with those who might assume leadership in a post-Homany government.
mels/reagan_1987_4_3_037.pt|pitch/reagan_1987_4_3_037.pt|I asked so many questions about the hostages' welfare that I didn't ask enough about the specifics of the total Iran plan.
mels/reagan_1987_4_3_038.pt|pitch/reagan_1987_4_3_038.pt|Let me say to the hostage families, we have not given up.
mels/reagan_1987_4_3_039.pt|pitch/reagan_1987_4_3_039.pt|We never will, and I promise you will use every legitimate means to free your loved ones from captivity.
mels/reagan_1987_4_3_040.pt|pitch/reagan_1987_4_3_040.pt|But I must also caution that those Americans who freely remain in such dangerous areas must know that they're responsible for their own safety.
mels/reagan_1987_4_3_041.pt|pitch/reagan_1987_4_3_041.pt|Now, another major aspect of the Board's findings regards the transfer of funds to the Nicaraguan Contras.
mels/reagan_1987_4_3_042.pt|pitch/reagan_1987_4_3_042.pt|The Tower Board wasn't able to find out what happened to this money.
mels/reagan_1987_4_3_043.pt|pitch/reagan_1987_4_3_043.pt|So the facts here will be left to the continuing investigations of the court appointed independent council and the two congressional investigating committees.
mels/reagan_1987_4_3_044.pt|pitch/reagan_1987_4_3_044.pt|I'm confident the truth will come out about this matter as well.
mels/reagan_1987_4_3_045.pt|pitch/reagan_1987_4_3_045.pt|As I told the Tower Board, I didn't know about any diversion of funds to the Contras, but as President, I cannot escape responsibility.

mels/reagan_1987_4_3_054.pt|pitch/reagan_1987_4_3_054.pt|I told them that I wanted a policy that was as justifiable and understandable in public as it was in secret.

mels/reagan_1987_4_3_059.pt|pitch/reagan_1987_4_3_059.pt|One thing still upsetting me, however, is that no one kept proper records of meetings or decisions.
mels/reagan_1987_4_3_060.pt|pitch/reagan_1987_4_3_060.pt|This led to my failure to recollect whether I approved an arm shipment before or after the fact.

mels/reagan_1983_23_3_182.pt|pitch/reagan_1983_23_3_182.pt|The fact is that in the past few decades, we have seen a dramatic shift in how we spend the taxpayers' dollar.

mels/reagan_1983_23_3_200.pt|pitch/reagan_1983_23_3_200.pt|This approach to stability through offensive threat has worked.
mels/reagan_1983_23_3_201.pt|pitch/reagan_1983_23_3_201.pt|We and our allies have succeeded in preventing nuclear war for more than three decades.

mels/reagan_1983_23_3_208.pt|pitch/reagan_1983_23_3_208.pt|But let me just say I'm totally committed to this course.
mels/reagan_1983_23_3_209.pt|pitch/reagan_1983_23_3_209.pt|If the Soviet Union will join with us in our effort to achieve major arms reduction, we will have succeeded in stabilizing the nuclear balance.
mels/reagan_1983_23_3_210.pt|pitch/reagan_1983_23_3_210.pt|Nevertheless, it will still be necessary to rely on the specter of retaliation on mutual threat.
mels/reagan_1983_23_3_211.pt|pitch/reagan_1983_23_3_211.pt|And that's a sad commentary on the human condition.

mels/reagan_1981_28_4_040.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_28_4_040.pt|One is the measure offered by the House Budget Committee.
mels/reagan_1981_28_4_041.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_28_4_041.pt|The other is a bipartisan measure, a substitute introduced by Congressman Phil Graham of Texas and Del Lata of Ohio.
mels/reagan_1981_28_4_043.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_28_4_043.pt|At the same time, however, I must state our opposition to the measure offered by the House Budget Committee.

mels/reagan_1981_28_4_045.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_28_4_045.pt|In reality, however, there are no more alternatives left.
mels/reagan_1981_28_4_046.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_28_4_046.pt|The committee measure quite simply falls far too short of the essential actions that we must take.

mels/reagan_1982_16_8_054.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_054.pt|Start with interest rates, the basic cause of the present recession.
mels/reagan_1982_16_8_055.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_055.pt|The prime rate was, as I said, 21.5%.
mels/reagan_1982_16_8_056.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_056.pt|Well, last week it was 14.5%, and as of today, three major banks have lowered it to 14%.
mels/reagan_1982_16_8_057.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_057.pt|Last week, 98 Treasury bills were paying less than 9% interest.
mels/reagan_1982_16_8_058.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_058.pt|One year ago, they were paying 15.5%.
mels/reagan_1982_16_8_059.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_059.pt|That double-digit inflation, 12.4%, has been cut in half for the last six months.
mels/reagan_1982_16_8_060.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_060.pt|Real earnings are at last increasing for the first time in quite a long time.
mels/reagan_1982_16_8_061.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_061.pt|Personal savings, which trended downwards throughout the last decade, are increasing.
mels/reagan_1982_16_8_062.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_062.pt|This means more money in the pool of investment capital.
mels/reagan_1982_16_8_063.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_063.pt|This will help further reduce interest rates.
mels/reagan_1982_16_8_064.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_064.pt|All of this, in only 10 months, hardly looks like a program that failed to me.

mels/reagan_1982_16_8_067.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_067.pt|Our biggest problem, the last one to be solved in every recession, is unemployment.

mels/reagan_1982_16_8_070.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_070.pt|Again, let me say, the main obstacle to their doing so is continued high interest rates.
mels/reagan_1982_16_8_071.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_071.pt|Those rates should be lower now than they are with the success we've had in reducing inflation.
mels/reagan_1982_16_8_072.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_072.pt|But part of the problem is psychological.
mels/reagan_1982_16_8_073.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_073.pt|A pessimism in the money markets that we won't stay the course and continue lowering the cost of government.
mels/reagan_1982_16_8_074.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_074.pt|The projected increase in budget deficits has added to that pessimism and fear.
mels/reagan_1982_16_8_075.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_075.pt|And this brings us back to that so-called greatest tax increase in history and the budget proposals now before the Congress.
mels/reagan_1982_16_8_077.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_077.pt|This time, however, we couldn't get the support we had last year.
mels/reagan_1982_16_8_078.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_078.pt|Some who had not been happy about the tax cuts then were now insisting we must have additional tax revenues.
mels/reagan_1982_16_8_079.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_079.pt|In fact, they wanted to cancel the reduction scheduled for next July and cancel the indexing of tax brackets.
mels/reagan_1982_16_8_080.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_080.pt|Others proposed tax increases, mounting to about $150 billion over a three-year period.
mels/reagan_1982_16_8_082.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_082.pt|For many months now, we've been working to get a compromised budget that would further reduce spending and thus reduce the deficits.
mels/reagan_1982_16_8_083.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_083.pt|We also have stood firm on retaining the tax cuts already in place because, as I said, they are essential to restoring the economy.
mels/reagan_1982_16_8_088.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_088.pt|Now, as you can see, that figures out to about a three-to-one ratio.
mels/reagan_1982_16_8_089.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_089.pt|$3 less in spending outlays for each $1 of increased revenue.
mels/reagan_1982_16_8_090.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_090.pt|This compromise adds up to a total over three years of a $380 billion reduction in the budget deficits.
mels/reagan_1982_16_8_092.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_092.pt|Now, let me take that $99 billion tax program apart and you decide whether it's the biggest tax increase in history.

mels/reagan_1982_16_8_100.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_100.pt|There is an excise tax on cigarettes, another on telephones.
mels/reagan_1982_16_8_101.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_101.pt|Well, for people who smoke a pack a day, that tax will mean an increase of only $2.40 a month.
mels/reagan_1982_16_8_102.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_102.pt|The telephone tax increase is only about $0.54 a month for the average household.

mels/reagan_1982_16_8_105.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_105.pt|They'll go to $788.
mels/reagan_1982_16_8_106.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_106.pt|And here's what the totals look like.
mels/reagan_1982_16_8_107.pt|pitch/reagan_1982_16_8_107.pt|The new tax reform will raise in three years, about, as I say, $99 billion.

mels/reagan_1983_25_1_084.pt|pitch/reagan_1983_25_1_084.pt|First, in my budget message, I will recommend a federal spending freeze.
mels/reagan_1983_25_1_085.pt|pitch/reagan_1983_25_1_085.pt|I know there's a strong medicine, but so far we have only cut the rate of increase in federal spending.

mels/reagan_1983_25_1_088.pt|pitch/reagan_1983_25_1_088.pt|In other words, the federal government will hold the line on real spending.
mels/reagan_1983_25_1_089.pt|pitch/reagan_1983_25_1_089.pt|That's far less than many American families have had to do in these difficult times.

mels/reagan_1983_25_1_093.pt|pitch/reagan_1983_25_1_093.pt|Second, I will ask the Congress to adopt specific measures to control the growth of the so-called uncontrollable spending programs.
mels/reagan_1983_25_1_094.pt|pitch/reagan_1983_25_1_094.pt|These are the automatic spending programs, such as food stamps, that cannot be simply frozen and that have grown by over 400 percent since 1970.

mels/reagan_1983_25_1_101.pt|pitch/reagan_1983_25_1_101.pt|The truly needy suffer, as funds intended for them are taken not by the needy, but by the greedy.
mels/reagan_1983_25_1_102.pt|pitch/reagan_1983_25_1_102.pt|For everyone's sake, we must put an end to such waste and corruption.

mels/reagan_1983_25_1_109.pt|pitch/reagan_1983_25_1_109.pt|In the meantime, we'll continue to study ways to simplify the tax code and make it more fair for all Americans.

mels/reagan_1986_14_9_045.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_14_9_045.pt|The job ahead of us is very clear.
mels/reagan_1986_14_9_046.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_14_9_046.pt|Nancy's personal crusade, like that of so many other wonderful individuals, should become our national crusade.
mels/reagan_1986_14_9_047.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_14_9_047.pt|It must include a combination of government and private efforts which complement one another.
mels/reagan_1986_14_9_048.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_14_9_048.pt|Last month, I announced six initiatives which we believe will do just that.
mels/reagan_1986_14_9_049.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_14_9_049.pt|First, we seek a drug-free workplace at all levels of government and in the private sector.
mels/reagan_1986_14_9_050.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_14_9_050.pt|Second, we'll work toward drug-free schools.
mels/reagan_1986_14_9_051.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_14_9_051.pt|Third, we want to ensure that the public is protected and the treatment is available to substance abusers and the chemically dependent.
mels/reagan_1986_14_9_052.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_14_9_052.pt|Our fourth goal is to expand international cooperation while treating drug trafficking as a threat to our national security.
mels/reagan_1986_14_9_053.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_14_9_053.pt|In October, I will be meeting with key US ambassadors to discuss what can be done to support our friends abroad.
mels/reagan_1986_14_9_054.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_14_9_054.pt|Fifth, we must move to strengthen law enforcement activities such as those initiated by Vice President Bush and Attorney General Mice.
mels/reagan_1986_14_9_055.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_14_9_055.pt|And finally, we seek to expand public awareness and prevention.
mels/reagan_1986_14_9_056.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_14_9_056.pt|In order to further implement these six goals, I will announce tomorrow a series of new proposals for a drug-free America.
mels/reagan_1986_14_9_058.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_14_9_058.pt|Together with our ongoing efforts, these proposals will bring the federal commitment to fighting drugs to $3 billion.
mels/reagan_1986_14_9_059.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_14_9_059.pt|As much financing as we commit, however, we would be fooling ourselves if we thought that massive new amounts of money alone will provide the solution.
mels/reagan_1986_14_9_060.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_14_9_060.pt|Let us not forget that in America, people solve problems and no national crusade has ever succeeded without human investment.
mels/reagan_1986_14_9_061.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_14_9_061.pt|Winning the crusade against drugs will not be achieved by just throwing money at the problem.
mels/reagan_1986_14_9_062.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_14_9_062.pt|Your government will continue to act aggressively, but nothing would be more effective than for Americans simply to quit using illegal drugs.
mels/reagan_1986_14_9_064.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_14_9_064.pt|I believe quite simply that we can help them quit, and that's where you come in.
mels/reagan_1986_14_9_065.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_14_9_065.pt|My generation will remember how America swung into action when we were attacked in World War II.
mels/reagan_1986_14_9_067.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_14_9_067.pt|Well, now we're in another war for our freedom, and it's time for all of us to pull together again.
mels/reagan_1986_14_9_068.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_14_9_068.pt|So, for example, if your friend or neighbor or a family member has a drug or alcohol problem, don't turn the other way.

mels/reagan_1986_14_9_073.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_14_9_073.pt|You can help others by telling your story and providing a willing hand to those in need.

mels/reagan_1986_14_9_075.pt|pitch/reagan_1986_14_9_075.pt|It's time, as Nancy said, for America to just say no to drugs.

mels/reagan_1989_11_11_161.pt|pitch/reagan_1989_11_11_161.pt|The resurgence of national pride that I called the new patriotism.

mels/reagan_1989_11_11_166.pt|pitch/reagan_1989_11_11_166.pt|We were taught very directly what it means to be an American.
mels/reagan_1989_11_11_167.pt|pitch/reagan_1989_11_11_167.pt|And we absorbed almost in the air, a love of country and an appreciation of its institutions.

mels/reagan_1985_21_11_021.pt|pitch/reagan_1985_21_11_021.pt|I brought these questions to the summit and put them before Mr. Gorbachev.
mels/reagan_1985_21_11_022.pt|pitch/reagan_1985_21_11_022.pt|We discussed nuclear arms and how to reduce them.
mels/reagan_1985_21_11_023.pt|pitch/reagan_1985_21_11_023.pt|I explained our proposals for equitable, verifiable and deep reductions.
mels/reagan_1985_21_11_024.pt|pitch/reagan_1985_21_11_024.pt|I outlined my conviction that our proposals would make not just for a world that feels safer but one that is really safer.

mels/reagan_1985_21_11_036.pt|pitch/reagan_1985_21_11_036.pt|Mr. Gorbachev insisted that we might use a strategic defense system to put offensive weapons into space and establish nuclear superiority.

mels/reagan_1985_21_11_045.pt|pitch/reagan_1985_21_11_045.pt|I went further in expressing our peaceful intentions.

mels/reagan_1985_21_11_066.pt|pitch/reagan_1985_21_11_066.pt|And as I mentioned, we agreed to continue meeting.

mels/reagan_1981_18_11_026.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_18_11_026.pt|I should say, by saying,

mels/reagan_1981_18_11_057.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_18_11_057.pt|Consider the facts.
mels/reagan_1981_18_11_058.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_18_11_058.pt|Over the past decade, the United States reduced the size of its armed forces and decreased its military spending.
mels/reagan_1981_18_11_059.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_18_11_059.pt|The Soviets steadily increased the number of men under arms. They now number more than double those of the United States.
mels/reagan_1981_18_11_060.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_18_11_060.pt|Over the same period, the Soviets expanded their real military spending by about one-third.

mels/reagan_1981_18_11_064.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_18_11_064.pt|Our response to this relentless build-up of Soviet military power has been restrained but firm.
mels/reagan_1981_18_11_065.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_18_11_065.pt|We have made decisions to strengthen all three legs of the strategic triad, sea, land and air-based.
mels/reagan_1981_18_11_069.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_18_11_069.pt|There are other Soviet weapon systems which also represent a major threat.
mels/reagan_1981_18_11_070.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_18_11_070.pt|Now the only answer to these systems is a comparable threat to Soviet threats.

mels/reagan_1981_18_11_074.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_18_11_074.pt|These missiles are to be deployed in several countries of Western Europe.

mels/reagan_1981_18_11_077.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_18_11_077.pt|Deployment of these systems will demonstrate to the Soviet Union that this link cannot be broken.
mels/reagan_1981_18_11_078.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_18_11_078.pt|Deturing war depends on the perceived ability of our forces to perform effectively.

mels/reagan_1981_18_11_081.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_18_11_081.pt|Now, let me turn now to our hopes for arms control negotiations.
mels/reagan_1981_18_11_082.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_18_11_082.pt|There's a tendency to make this entire subject overly complex.
mels/reagan_1981_18_11_083.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_18_11_083.pt|I want to be clear and concise.
mels/reagan_1981_18_11_084.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_18_11_084.pt|I told you of the letter I wrote to President Brezhnev last April, well, I've just sent another message to the Soviet leadership.
mels/reagan_1981_18_11_085.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_18_11_085.pt|It's a simple straightforward yet historic message.
mels/reagan_1981_18_11_086.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_18_11_086.pt|The United States proposes the mutual reduction of conventional, intermediate range nuclear and strategic forces.
mels/reagan_1981_18_11_087.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_18_11_087.pt|Specifically, I have proposed a four-point agenda to achieve this objective in my letter to President Brezhnev.
mels/reagan_1981_18_11_088.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_18_11_088.pt|The first and most important point concerns the Geneva negotiations.
mels/reagan_1981_18_11_090.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_18_11_090.pt|The United States has been preparing for these negotiations through close consultation with our NATO partners.
mels/reagan_1981_18_11_091.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_18_11_091.pt|We're now ready to set forth our proposal.
mels/reagan_1981_18_11_094.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_18_11_094.pt|This would be an historic step.
mels/reagan_1981_18_11_095.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_18_11_095.pt|With Soviet agreement, we could together substantially reduce the dread threat of nuclear war which hangs over the people of Europe.

mels/reagan_1981_18_11_097.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_18_11_097.pt|Now, we intend to negotiate in good faith and go to Geneva willing to listen and to and consider the proposals of our Soviet counterpots.
mels/reagan_1981_18_11_098.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_18_11_098.pt|But let me call to your attention the background of which, against which our proposal is made.

mels/reagan_1981_18_11_101.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_18_11_101.pt|And the United States has no comparable missiles.
mels/reagan_1981_18_11_102.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_18_11_102.pt|Indeed, the United States dismantled the last such missile in Europe over 15 years ago.
mels/reagan_1981_18_11_104.pt|pitch/reagan_1981_18_11_104.pt|The Soviets assert that a balance of intermediate-range nuclear forces already exists.

mels/reagan_1994_030.pt|pitch/reagan_1994_030.pt|Thank you and God bless you.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_001.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_001.pt|no hood,
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_002.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_002.pt|I'm glad you asked that question because I know it's on many people's minds.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_003.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_003.pt|I aborted an investigation.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_004.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_004.pt|I know that CIA is already going forward with one.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_006.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_006.pt|And he drew up this manual.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_007.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_007.pt|It was turned over to the agency head in of the CIA in Nicaragua.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_008.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_008.pt|Uh, to be printed and a number of pages were excised by that agency head there, the man in charge.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_009.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_009.pt|And he sent it on up here to CIA where more pages were excised before it was printed.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_011.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_011.pt|Now those that details as we have them.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_013.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_013.pt|We'll take the proper action at the proper time.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_014.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_014.pt|I was very interested to hear about Central America and our process down there.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_016.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_016.pt|Including diplomatic processes throughout Central America and working closely with the Contedora group.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_018.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_018.pt|But if guilt is established, whoever is guilty, we will treat with that situation.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_019.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_019.pt|Then.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_020.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_020.pt|And they will be removed.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_021.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_021.pt|Yes, I have so many things there to respond to.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_022.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_022.pt|I'm going to pick out something you said earlier.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_024.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_024.pt|I never ever conceived of such a thing.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_025.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_025.pt|I never said any such thing in a discussion of our strategic arms negotiations.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_026.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_026.pt|I said that submarines carrying missiles and airplanes carrying.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_027.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_027.pt|And they were not just conventional missiles, but more conventional type weapons, not as destabilizing as the land-based missiles.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_028.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_028.pt|And that they were all so weapons that or carriers that if they were sent out and there was a change, you could call them back before they had launched their missiles.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_030.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_030.pt|I think is as ridiculous as the as the whole concept has been.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_031.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_031.pt|So thank you for giving me a chance to straighten the record.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_032.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_032.pt|I'm sure that you appreciate that.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_033.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_033.pt|I have said a number of occasions exactly what I believe about the Soviet Union.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_034.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_034.pt|I retract nothing that I have said.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_035.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_035.pt|I believe that many of the things they have done are evil in any concept of morality that we have.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_036.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_036.pt|But I also recognize that as the two great superpowers in the world, we have to live with each other.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_037.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_037.pt|And I told Mr. Grameco, we don't like their system, they don't like ours.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_038.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_038.pt|And we're not going to change their system and they sure better not try to change ours.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_039.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_039.pt|But between us, we can either destroy the world or we can save it.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_041.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_041.pt|And I think that perhaps we established a little better understanding.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_042.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_042.pt|I think that in dealing with the Soviet Union, one has to be realistic.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_044.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_044.pt|And the result was unilateral disarmament.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_045.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_045.pt|We canceled the B1 under the previous administration.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_046.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_046.pt|What did we get for it?
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_047.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_047.pt|Nothing.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_048.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_048.pt|The Soviet Union has been engaged in the biggest military build up in the history of man.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_049.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_049.pt|At the same time that we tried the policy of unilateral disarmament, of weakness, if you will.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_050.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_050.pt|And now we are putting up a defense of our own and I've made it very plain to them.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_051.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_051.pt|We seek no superiority.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_052.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_052.pt|We simply are going to provide a deterrent so that it would be too costly for them if they are nursing any ideas of aggression against us.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_053.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_053.pt|Now they claim they are not.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_054.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_054.pt|And I made it plain to them.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_055.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_055.pt|We are not.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_056.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_056.pt|But this, there's been no change in my attitude at all.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_058.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_058.pt|And we did get their attention.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_059.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_059.pt|Now you've added a hypothetical there at the end to Cal.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_060.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_060.pt|About that where we would send troops into fight.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_061.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_061.pt|I am not going to make the decisions to what the tactics could be.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_062.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_062.pt|But obviously there are a number of areas in the world that are of importance to us.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_063.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_063.pt|Because one is the Middle East.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_064.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_064.pt|And that is of interest to the whole Western world and the industrialized nations because of the great supply of energy on which so many depend there.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_065.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_065.pt|The, our neighbors here in America are vital to us.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_067.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_067.pt|From Angola.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_068.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_068.pt|So I can say there are a great many interest.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_069.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_069.pt|I believe that we have a great interest in the Pacific Basin.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_070.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_070.pt|That is where I think the future of the world lies.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_071.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_071.pt|But I am not going to pick out one and in advance hypothetically say, oh yes, we would send troops there.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_072.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_072.pt|Yes, I am not going to continue trying to respond to these repetitions of the falsehoods that have already been stated here.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_074.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_074.pt|And that is an image of strength.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_075.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_075.pt|Except that if he had had his way when the Nimitz was being planned, he would have been deep in the water out there because there wouldn't have been any Nimitz to stand on.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_076.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_076.pt|He was against it.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_077.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_077.pt|He was against the F-14 fighter.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_078.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_078.pt|He was against the M-1 tank.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_079.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_079.pt|He was against the B-1 bomber.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_080.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_080.pt|He wanted to cut the salary of the all of the military.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_081.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_081.pt|He wanted to bring home half of the American forces in Europe.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_082.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_082.pt|And he has a record of weakness with regard to our national defense that is second to none.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_083.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_083.pt|Indeed, he was on that side virtually throughout all his years in the Senate.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_084.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_084.pt|But Andy opposed even the President Carter when toward the end of his term President Carter wanted to increase the defense budget.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_085.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_085.pt|No more than I don't agree to all of those things.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_088.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_088.pt|Israel could not be blamed for that.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_089.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_089.pt|Those terrorists had been violating their northern border consistently and Israel chased them all the way to there.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_092.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_092.pt|And we were succeeding.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_093.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_093.pt|We were there for the better part of a year.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_094.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_094.pt|Our position happened to be at the airport.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_095.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_095.pt|All of the were occasional snipings and sometimes some artillery fire.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_096.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_096.pt|But we did not engage in conflict that was out of line with our mission.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_097.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_097.pt|I will never send troops anywhere in a mission of that kind.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_098.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_098.pt|Without telling them that if somebody shoots at them, they can darn well shoot back.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_099.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_099.pt|And this is what we did.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_100.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_100.pt|We never initiated any kind of action.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_101.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_101.pt|We defended ourselves there.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_102.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_102.pt|But we were succeeding to the point that the Lebanese government had been organized.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_103.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_103.pt|If you remember there were the meetings in Geneva in which they began to meet with the hostile, factual forces and try to put together some kind of a peace plan.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_104.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_104.pt|We were succeeding and that was why the terrorist acts began.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_106.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_106.pt|And so the terrorist acts began and led to the one great tragedy when they were killed in that suicide bombing the building.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_107.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_107.pt|Then the multilateral force withdrew for only one reason.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_108.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_108.pt|We withdrew because we were no longer able to carry out the mission for which we had been sent in.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_109.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_109.pt|But we went in in the interest of peace and to keep Israel and Syria from getting into the sixth war between them.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_110.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_110.pt|And I have no apologies for our going on a peace mission.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_111.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_111.pt|Morton, no.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_112.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_112.pt|I think there's a great difference between the government of Iran threatening our diplomatic personnel.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_113.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_113.pt|And there is a government that you can see and can put your hand on.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_114.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_114.pt|In the terrorist situation, there are terrorist factions all over in a recent 30-day period.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_115.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_115.pt|37 terrorist acts in 20 countries have been committed.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_116.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_116.pt|The most recent has been the one in Brighton.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_117.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_117.pt|In dealing with terrorist, yes, we want to retaliate.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_119.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_119.pt|I have just signed legislation to add to our ability to deal along with our allies with this terrorist problem.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_121.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_121.pt|Well, the red light went on.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_122.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_122.pt|I could have gone on forever.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_123.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_123.pt|Yes, this had to do with our dishonorment talks.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_125.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_125.pt|So we thought that it would be simpler to negotiate first with those and then we made it plain a second phase take up the submarine launched the airborne missiles.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_127.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_127.pt|And therefore they wanted to take up all three and we agreed we said all right if that's what you want to do.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_129.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_129.pt|So why should we believe that they had placed that much real more reliance on land based.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_130.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_130.pt|But even after we gave in and said all right, let's discuss it all.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_131.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_131.pt|They walked away from the table.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_132.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_132.pt|We didn't.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_133.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_133.pt|Yes, I know to come as a surprise Mr. Mondale, but I am in charge.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_134.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_134.pt|And as a matter of fact, we haven't avoided arms control talks with the Soviet Union very early in my administration.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_135.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_135.pt|I proposed and I think something that had never been proposed by any previous administration.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_137.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_137.pt|When they protested that and suggested a smaller number perhaps I went along with that.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_139.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_139.pt|And it wasn't me that turned it down the Soviet Union dis about it.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_140.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_140.pt|And we believe me supported the Simpson-Mazoli bill strongly and the bill that came out of the Senate.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_141.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_141.pt|However, there were things added in the House side that we felt made it less of a good bill as a matter of fact made it a bad bill.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_143.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_143.pt|There were a number of things in there that we can that bill I can't go into detail about them here.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_144.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_144.pt|But it is true our borders are out of control.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_145.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_145.pt|It is also true that this has been a situation in our borders back through a number of administrations.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_146.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_146.pt|And I supported this bill.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_149.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_149.pt|There is another employer that we shouldn't be so concerned about.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_151.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_151.pt|And with none of the benefits that we think are normal and natural for workers in our country.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_152.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_152.pt|And the individuals can't complain because of their illegal status.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_153.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_153.pt|We don't think that those people should be allowed to continue operating free.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_154.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_154.pt|And this was why the provisions that we had in with regard to sanctions and so forth.
mels/reagan_1984_21_10_158.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_21_10_158.pt|No, as a matter of fact the population explosion, if you look at the actual figures has been vastly exaggerated.

mels/reagan_1984_7_10_078.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_078.pt|As a matter of fact, I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mr. Mondale's running mate said I wasn't a good Christian.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_079.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_079.pt|So it does play a part in my life.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_080.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_080.pt|I have no hesitancy in saying so.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_082.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_082.pt|Yes, it's very difficult to rebut because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr. Mondale.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_083.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_083.pt|I too want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_085.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_085.pt|And they have been using these things to have government through court orders, inhibit the practice of religion.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_086.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_086.pt|A child wants to say grace in its school cafeteria and a court rules that they can't do it.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_087.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_087.pt|And because it's school property, these are the types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_088.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_088.pt|And I am opposed to that with regard to a platform in the Supreme Court, I can only say one thing about that.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_089.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_089.pt|I don't, I have appointed one member of the Supreme Court, Sandra Day O'Connor.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_090.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_090.pt|I'll stand in my record on that and if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, I'll do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_091.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_091.pt|Mr. Mondale, your rebuttal please.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_092.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_092.pt|Well again, I am running on the record.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_093.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_093.pt|I think sometimes Mr. Mondale's running away from his.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_094.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_094.pt|But I'm running on the record of what we have asked for.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_097.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_097.pt|And you might find those words in a democratic platform of some years ago, I know because I was a Democrat at that time.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_099.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_099.pt|I promised when we took office that we would reduce inflation, we have to one third of what it was.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_100.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_100.pt|I promised that we would reduce taxes.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_102.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_102.pt|But at least it took that burden away from them.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_103.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_103.pt|I said that we would create jobs for our people and we did six million in the last 20 or 21 months.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_105.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_105.pt|We have done that.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_107.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_107.pt|And I think this is something the American people see.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_109.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_109.pt|We find 35 states with task forces now dealing with their educational problems.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_110.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_110.pt|We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_111.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_111.pt|All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_112.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_112.pt|So I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrats saw.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_113.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_113.pt|The leadership isn't taking this where we want to go.

mels/reagan_1984_7_10_116.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_116.pt|I think that we've had something to do with that just as we have with the drug problem nationwide.

mels/reagan_1984_7_10_118.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_118.pt|Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment.

mels/reagan_1984_7_10_121.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_121.pt|I think that we're out in front of most.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_124.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_124.pt|With me abortion is not a problem of religion.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_125.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_125.pt|It's a problem of the Constitution.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_127.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_127.pt|And I think that this is what we should concentrate on is trying I know there was weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_128.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_128.pt|There were medical authorities.

mels/reagan_1984_7_10_132.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_132.pt|Also there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_137.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_137.pt|Well with regard to this being a personal choice isn't that what a murderer is insisting on.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_138.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_138.pt|Here's her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_139.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_139.pt|Now I'm not capable and I don't think you are any of us to make this determination that must be made with regard to human life.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_140.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_140.pt|I am simply saying that I believe that that's where the effort should be directed to make that determination.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_143.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_143.pt|That instead we make it available for the adoption there are a million and a half people out there standing in line waiting to adopt children who can't have them any other way.

mels/reagan_1984_7_10_146.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_146.pt|I'm not going to increase taxes.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_147.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_147.pt|I can understand why you are Mr. Mondale because as a senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_150.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_150.pt|From 50,000 down those people paid two thirds of the taxes and those people got two thirds of the tax cut.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_151.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_151.pt|Now the social security tax of 77.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_152.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_152.pt|This indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_153.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_153.pt|It had two features.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_154.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_154.pt|It had several tax increases phased in over a period of time there are two more yet to come between now and eight and 1989.
mels/reagan_1984_7_10_155.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_155.pt|At the same time every year it increased the amount of money.

mels/reagan_1984_7_10_159.pt|pitch/reagan_1984_7_10_159.pt|Now I don't think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich and not the other way around it just doesn't work out that way.
