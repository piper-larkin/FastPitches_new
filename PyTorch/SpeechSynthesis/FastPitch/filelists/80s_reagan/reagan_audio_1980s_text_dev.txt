wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_019.wav|Washington will never change its spending habits.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_001.wav|my fellow Americans,
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_026.wav|I said that submarines carrying missiles and airplanes carrying.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_045.wav|After these four decades then there stands before the entire world one great and inescapable conclusion.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_030.wav|The sky would not fall if an American president spoke the truth.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_130.wav|This global democratic revolution has removed the specter so frightening a decade ago of democracy doomed to permanent minority status in the world.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_031.wav|Because of what you did, Republicans and Democrats in the Congress came together and passed them with sweeping cutbacks in the history of the federal budget.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_022.wav|Millions of you, Democrats, Republicans and Independents from every profession, trade and line of work and from every part of this land.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_172.wav|We have also begun the long-needed modernization of our conventional forces.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_165.wav|We're within sight of the safe port of economic recovery.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_012.wav|Your loved ones were daring and brave, and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says, give me a challenge and I'll meet it with joy.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_108.wav|In the same three years, as I said a moment ago, our tax cut program, even after this increase, will save you $335 billion.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_069.wav|Personnel, National Security Policy, and the process for making sure that the system works.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_092.wav|On the other side of the line, the Soviet forces also face East, to prevent their people from leaving.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_047.wav|Why did you do it?
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_161.wav|We just want to help them perform the good works they choose and help others to profit by their example.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_135.wav|While we grew a complacent others have acted.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_160.wav|Additionally, a major effort will be focused on encouraging the expansion of private community childcare.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_072.wav|These are the things that shaped the unity of the allies.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_077.wav|Under him, the NSC staff is being rebuilt with proper management discipline.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_033.wav|The United States does not start fights.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_031.wav|We were never the aggressors.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_030.wav|Teddy Roosevelt said that a nation that does great work lives forever.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_044.wav|It is the whole world where popular government might flourish and prosper.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_052.wav|I saw that everyone was just sitting there looking at me and then one of them broke the silence.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_121.wav|America must win this war.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_039.wav|I do recall that on one occasion Sir Winston Churchill said an exasperation about one of our most distinguished diplomats.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_052.wav|They're asking the wrong people to tighten their belts.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_093.wav|We meant to change a nation.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_050.wav|But at last, there is agreement that we can't spend ourselves rich.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_191.wav|That's for emergencies.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_096.wav|There was a time when we were able to offset superior Soviet numbers with higher quality.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_032.wav|We owe it to today's older Americans and today's younger workers.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_049.wav|And that's why I'm certain that the bill I'm signing today is not only an historic overhaul of our tax code and a sweeping victory for fairness.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_049.wav|Eight months later, this sparkling young life ended here at Burger Bellson.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_156.wav|Virtually every year there may have been one or two that were skipped in there that was subject to that tax.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_075.wav|We will suspend Polish civil aviation privileges in the United States.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_083.wav|There is another vital reform.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_092.wav|Well again, I am running on the record.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_034.wav|We protect the freedom of expression of the author as we should.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_032.wav|There were also pessimistic predictions about the relationship between our administration and this Congress.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_090.wav|Since 1974 the United States has produced 3,050 tactical combat aircraft.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_105.wav|We've begun coordinating economic and monetary policy among our major trading partners, but there's more to do.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_126.wav|But no citizen need tremble, no the world's shutter.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_211.wav|George Bush, who I think is one of the finest vice presidents this country has ever had.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_054.wav|Faith that they fought for all humanity.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_104.wav|They stood for hours in the hot sun, waiting for their turn to vote.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_054.wav|We face those deficits because the federal government overspends.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_088.wav|And as we renew ourselves here in our own land, we will be seen as having greater strength throughout the world.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_001.wav|I congratulate all of you who are members of this historic 100th Congress of the United States of America.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_096.wav|Now, we will never abandon those who, through no fault of their own, must have our help.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_063.wav|If history teaches anything it teaches self delusion in the face of unpleasant facts is folly.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_041.wav|You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_062.wav|If we don't, the recovery will be too short.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_094.wav|So together, we can listen less than the risk of war now and forever.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_057.wav|For many months, the Soviets refused to bargain in earnestness.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_205.wav|I thought you might like to meet an American hero named Jean Quing.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_099.wav|You, Berliners, have built a great city.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_028.wav|I took a risk with regard to our action in Iran.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_048.wav|The very day America's families have to foot the bill for the budgets that you produce.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_034.wav|And we speak about the necessity for actions to steal us for the challenges of growth, trade and security in the next decade and the year 2000.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_027.wav|Inflation is down from 12.4% to 8.9, and for the month of December, it was running at an annualized rate of 5.2%.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_075.wav|Above all there was a new peace to be assured.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_089.wav|That's far less than many American families have had to do in these difficult times.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_024.wav|You wanted to change one little, two little word, tattoo letter word, I should say.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_062.wav|Well since 1969 the Soviet Union has built five new classes of ICBMs and upgraded these eight times.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_088.wav|In other words, the federal government will hold the line on real spending.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_208.wav|That's how I saw it and see it still.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_184.wav|And what those 30 seconds over Tokyo meant?
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_160.wav|But it's almost like going back to the Malthusian theory when even then they were saying that everyone would starve with the limited population they had then.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_032.wav|But in some ways that's even more true today.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_046.wav|What of all the entrepreneurs that fail?
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_164.wav|Once a source of discord, now a source of pride must continue with no backsliding or slowing down.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_157.wav|We must strive through innovations like the payment in kind crop swap approach and an aggressive export policy to restore health and vitality to rural America.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_075.wav|The United States has made serious, fair, and far-reaching proposals to the Soviet Union, and this is a moment of rare opportunity for arms reduction.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_236.wav|I clearly recognize that defensive systems have limitations and raise certain problems and ambiguities.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_040.wav|Weakness only invites aggression.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_059.wav|As much financing as we commit, however, we would be fooling ourselves if we thought that massive new amounts of money alone will provide the solution.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_097.wav|And you might find those words in a democratic platform of some years ago, I know because I was a Democrat at that time.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_080.wav|First, the social safety net for the elderly, the needy, the disabled and unemployed will be left intact.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_145.wav|As I suggested in 1982, if the West maintained its strength, we would see economic needs clash with the political order in the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_143.wav|So states the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which among other things guarantees free elections.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_238.wav|Together they weathered the storm and preserved the Union.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_093.wav|The hard evidence of totalitarian rule is caused in mankind and uprising of the intellect and will.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_009.wav|These United States are confronted with an economic affliction of great proportions.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_079.wav|He was against the B-1 bomber.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_162.wav|It is time that we committed ourselves as a nation in both the public and private sectors to assisting democratic development.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_033.wav|We'll continue our quest in space.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_137.wav|Well with regard to this being a personal choice isn't that what a murderer is insisting on.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_055.wav|We discussed human rights.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_004.wav|This subject involves the most basic duty that any president and any people share, the duty to protect and strengthen the peace.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_108.wav|We the people are the driver.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_054.wav|I believe I succeeded.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_084.wav|In the matter of human rights, we've also seen extraordinary progress.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_120.wav|We've rediscovered that work is good in and of itself, that it enables us to create and contribute, no matter how seemingly humble our jobs.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_121.wav|In African Nigeria is moving into remarkable and unmistakable ways to build and strengthen its democratic institutions.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_219.wav|We don't have to turn to our history books for heroes.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_087.wav|This is what we call a zero zero plan.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_170.wav|We see the dream glow in the towering talent of a 12-year-old to long-forward.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_101.wav|It's time this may be the most radical thing I've said in seven years in office it's time for Washington to show a little humility.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_074.wav|Being friends to others is the best way of being friends to ourselves.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_019.wav|Let's prove to them and to ourselves that democracy works even in an election year.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_079.wav|In fact, they wanted to cancel the reduction scheduled for next July and cancel the indexing of tax brackets.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_141.wav|I don't think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self-defense tradition.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_087.wav|But there is more to do.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_037.wav|There was the impossible valor of the Poles who threw themselves between the enemy and the rest of Europe as the invasion took hold.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_103.wav|Nothing happens unless first a dream.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_104.wav|We were succeeding and that was why the terrorist acts began.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_088.wav|Funding for social insurance programs will be more than double the amount spent only six years ago.
wavs/reagan_1994_019.wav|Today, political correctness has replaced pro-Marxist ideas as the conventional wisdom on too many campuses.
wavs/reagan_1988_11_11_005.wav|we conduct ceremonies
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_041.wav|The statue atop that cliff is called the Spirit of American Youth Rising From the Waves.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_045.wav|The opening meeting was a formal dinner for the heads of government of the seven industrialized nations.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_150.wav|We are proposing legislation for an experimental effort to improve and develop our depressed urban areas in the 1990s.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_047.wav|Now the Soviets themselves may in a limited way be coming to understand the importance of freedom.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_038.wav|They fear that the accumulation of weapons itself may lead to conflagration.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_121.wav|But in the Civil War that room was the one president Lincoln used as his office.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_170.wav|We're determining how to solve that problem.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_071.wav|I've brought in an accomplished and highly respected new team here at the White House.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_090.wav|But as long as we remember our first principles and believe in ourselves, the future will always be ours.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_101.wav|The truly needy suffer, as funds intended for them are taken not by the needy, but by the greedy.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_031.wav|I do not believe it was wrong to try to establish contacts with a country of strategic importance, or to try to save lives.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_012.wav|Tonight in millions of American homes the glow of the Christmas tree is a reflection of the love Jesus taught us.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_194.wav|God bless you and God bless America.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_093.wav|They could have been more meaningful if Soviet actions had shown restraint and commitment to stability at lower levels of force.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_017.wav|Well, I see more prosaic things.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_068.wav|The scourge of tyranny cannot be stopped with words alone.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_151.wav|Prefer government to work or control unions.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_062.wav|Today, over 90 percent does.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_161.wav|The new advisory council on private sector initiatives will carry on and extend this vital work of encouraging private initiative in 1983.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_006.wav|for our friends in Lebanon and Israel,
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_057.wav|they shall run and not be weary
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_089.wav|I don't, I have appointed one member of the Supreme Court, Sandra Day O'Connor.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_011.wav|And at the same time as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the government gets without raising taxes.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_053.wav|We didn't start them and indeed did everything we could to avoid being drawn into them.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_086.wav|The constant shrinkage of economic growth combined with the growth of military production is putting a heavy strain on the Soviet people.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_047.wav|Nor do I believe a war is inevitable, quite the contrary.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_082.wav|These policies will make our economy stronger, and the stronger economy will balance the budget which we are committed to do by 1984.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_006.wav|It is a message of peace and goodwill and hope for a growing friendship and closeness between our two peoples.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_034.wav|I also said that one area of government spending could not be reduced, but must instead be increased.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_119.wav|In the welfare culture, the breakdown of the family, the most basic support system, has reached crisis proportions.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_073.wav|It was more than just good television, more than just action news.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_177.wav|They unite us in a stewardship of peace and freedom with our allies and friends in NATO, in Asia, in Latin America, and elsewhere.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_048.wav|And we will propose reducing corporate rates while maintaining incentives for capital formation.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_104.wav|We can't be satisfied with cosmetic improvements that won't stand the test of time.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_003.wav|Nancy and I are paying to the Corps, but the tragedy of the Shuttle Challenger.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_008.wav|Well, maybe I can do a little of that tonight.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_166.wav|Those words of Harry Truman have special meaning for us today as we live with the potential to destroy civilization.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_046.wav|Well, I sat there like the new kid in school and listened and it was all Francois Visson, Helmut that.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_056.wav|You've heard a lot about the staff of the National Security Council in recent months.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_076.wav|We should not confuse the signing of agreements with the solving of problems.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_081.wav|On top of this, there was resistance to the spending reductions we asked for and even attempts to eliminate some of last year's cuts so as to actually increase spending.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_156.wav|Mr. Gorbachev and I first began working on this in 1985.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_144.wav|You know I wasn't going to say this at all but I can't help it and there you go again.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_050.wav|Today, I wish to reaffirm America's commitment to the Atlantic Alliance and I'll resolve to sustain the peace.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_106.wav|Recently, a few individuals and families have been allowed to visit relatives in the West.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_051.wav|It was because here in this land we unleashed the energy and individual genius of man to a greater extent than has ever been done before.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_036.wav|Tonight, as our decision day nears and as the House of Representatives weighs its alternatives, I wish to address you in that same spirit.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_137.wav|I urge the Soviet Union to join us and many other nations who are ready to launch this important enterprise.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_091.wav|But no more.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_028.wav|Despite our best efforts, illegal cocaine is coming into our country at alarming levels, and four to five million people regularly use it.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_023.wav|We're here because humanity refuses to accept that freedom of the spirit of man can ever be extinguished.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_073.wav|We understand that men and women of every race and creed can and must work together for peace.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_242.wav|We owe it to the unfortunate to be aware of their plight and to help them in every way we can.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_163.wav|That's not something you measure in a budget, but it's a very real part of our nation's strength.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_137.wav|When they protested that and suggested a smaller number perhaps I went along with that.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_151.wav|And with none of the benefits that we think are normal and natural for workers in our country.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_017.wav|It's hard to dazzle us, but for 25 years the United States space program has been doing just that.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_121.wav|I'm sure all of you join me in expressing heartfelt condolences on his passing.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_041.wav|Now, another major aspect of the Board's findings regards the transfer of funds to the Nicaraguan Contras.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_121.wav|And I would like, for I close to say one word.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_010.wav|He's in the second grade in the Riverside School in Rockville Center.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_179.wav|Their family incomes were so low.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_117.wav|The environment?
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_060.wav|Let us renew our determination, our courage, and our strength, and let us renew our faith and our hope.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_108.wav|This proposal would eliminate with one stroke those systems about which both sides have expressed the greatest concern.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_178.wav|And we're building a real capability to assist our friends in the vitally important Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf region.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_019.wav|Our military supremacy was unquestioned.
