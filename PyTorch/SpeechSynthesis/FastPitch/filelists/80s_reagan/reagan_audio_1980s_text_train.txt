wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_053.wav|If we summon the strength to continue on the course that we've charted.

wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_002.wav|I'm glad you asked that question because I know it's on many people's minds.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_117.wav|Substance, however, is far more important than timing.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_124.wav|We can and should attempt major qualitative and quantitative progress.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_164.wav|Now some say the research would be expensive, perhaps, but it could save millions of lives, indeed humanity itself.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_106.wav|Not mere sentiment.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_147.wav|I urge the House to follow the Senate and enact proposals permitting use of all reliable evidence that police officers acquire in good faith.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_040.wav|We didn't get all the cuts we wanted, and we got some tax measures.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_144.wav|But it is true our borders are out of control.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_164.wav|In the attempted restrictions on the President's power to implement treaties and untrade policy.

wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_127.wav|Some people may still ask, would the Soviets ever use their formidable military power?
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_126.wav|Well this time so far it's different.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_151.wav|Believe me, it wasn't pleasant for someone who had come to Washington to determine to reduce government spending.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_204.wav|Just ten years from the time she left Vietnam, she will graduate from the United States Military Academy at West Point.

wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_074.wav|The projected increase in budget deficits has added to that pessimism and fear.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_087.wav|Taken as a whole, the budget I'm producing or proposing for the next fiscal year will increase no more than the rate of inflation.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_014.wav|It is the result of excessive government spending.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_111.wav|Let our actions say to them the words for which Matthew, Ridgeway listened,
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_049.wav|Some who supported us on the spending cuts were fearful about cutting taxes in view of the continuing budget deficits.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_207.wav|They will know whether we use those weapons or not.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_038.wav|Well, not always patient.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_113.wav|That's one out of seven of all the meals served in America.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_008.wav|And I thank you and your people for all your help in maintaining the continuity, which is the bulwark of our republic.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_088.wav|The only territories we hold are memorials like this one and graveyards where our heroes rest.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_127.wav|And I think that this is what we should concentrate on is trying I know there was weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_078.wav|Some who had not been happy about the tax cuts then were now insisting we must have additional tax revenues.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_058.wav|Never again.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_167.wav|We hadn't launched one new strategic submarine for 17 years.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_200.wav|We should be proud of our role as peacemakers.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_018.wav|But if guilt is established, whoever is guilty, we will treat with that situation.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_233.wav|Their vital interests and hours are inextricably linked.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_068.wav|But we must remember a crucial fact.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_149.wav|Effective enforcement of our nation's fair housing laws is also essential to ensuring equal opportunity.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_064.wav|Every day brings fresh challenges and opportunities to match.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_043.wav|That dream is the heart and soul of America.

wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_075.wav|Over the past few weeks we've all learned what was tucked away behind a little comma here and there.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_043.wav|I believe that is the right thing to do.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_032.wav|This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_152.wav|Our economy is stronger than ever.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_006.wav|Mr. Speaker, before I begin my prepared remarks, may I point out that tonight marks the 10th and last state of the union message that you've presided over.

wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_045.wav|In reality, however, there are no more alternatives left.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_047.wav|Today, 46% believe they will.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_238.wav|Time and again, they prove that there is nothing.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_211.wav|Yes, we have our problems.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_010.wav|We mourn their loss as a nation together.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_163.wav|We see it in the war powers resolution.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_051.wav|It cannot be considered piecemeal.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_155.wav|America urges you to support the agenda for peace that I have outlined today.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_041.wav|We've come closer to achieving energy independence and help bring down the cost of gasoline and heating fuel.

wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_085.wav|They're still there, uninvited, unwanted, unyielding, almost 40 years after the war.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_125.wav|They have taken over the port that we built at Cameran Bay in Vietnam.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_109.wav|Too many of these and other such graves are the final resting places of teenagers who became men in the roar of battle.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_058.wav|This legislation is supported by a majority of you.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_003.wav|Yet it doesn't rest here.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_103.wav|They all came to taste the air, redel it and rich with the freedom that is ours.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_079.wav|In Europe, only one nation and those it controls refuse to join the community of freedom.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_137.wav|Evidence of noncompliance with existing arms control agreements underscores the need to approach negotiation of any new agreements with care.

wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_097.wav|Democracy, the profoundly good, is also the profoundly productive.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_027.wav|But it imposes an undue burden on none.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_006.wav|As a boy, I saw streets filled with model teas.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_117.wav|Yet we are denied the right to set aside in our schools a moment each day for those who wish to pray.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_022.wav|Instead, we wrote a new chapter in the history of mankind.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_054.wav|It includes the takeovers of Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Afghanistan and the ruthless repression of the proud people of Poland.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_199.wav|But since the advent of nuclear weapons, those steps have been increasingly directed toward deterrence of aggression through the promise of retaliation.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_084.wav|We, the people, those people, neighbors and friends, shopkeepers and laborers, farmers and craftsmen do not have infinite patience.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_001.wav|when the Allied armies joined in battle to reclaim this continent, to liberty.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_032.wav|I will never stand for a reduction of the social security benefits to the people that are now getting them.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_033.wav|Regimes planted by bayonets do not take root.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_130.wav|And here in the Congress it takes at least 166 committees just to try to keep track of them.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_056.wav|Let us cut through the fog for a moment.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_077.wav|They rebuilt a new Europe together.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_145.wav|Computer cross-checking has uncovered thousands of government checks still going to people who have been dead for several years.

wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_135.wav|He says he'd rather fight it out with the posse, even though they're hopelessly outnumbered.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_084.wav|The Soviet troops that came to the center of this continent did not leave when peace came.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_058.wav|They are eager and anxious to serve their country.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_006.wav|As a people we've been through quite a lot, moments of joy, tragedy, and of real achievement, moments that I believe have brought us all closer together.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_206.wav|We intend to keep the peace.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_041.wav|This strategy of deterrence has not changed.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_016.wav|Proverbs tell us that without a vision, the people perish.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_023.wav|And in the most important area, individual use, we see progress.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_158.wav|No, as a matter of fact the population explosion, if you look at the actual figures has been vastly exaggerated.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_226.wav|We who are in government.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_181.wav|How these great branches of government perform their legitimate roles is critically important to the nation's ability to succeed.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_088.wav|Now, as you can see, that figures out to about a three-to-one ratio.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_081.wav|In this new year, we toasted the new peacefulness around the globe.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_066.wav|Contrary to the drumbeat we've been hearing for the last few months, the deficits we face are not rooted in defense spending.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_091.wav|There's a lesson here that we all should write on the blackboard a hundred times.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_058.wav|Over the past decade, the United States reduced the size of its armed forces and decreased its military spending.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_029.wav|40 years ago today, British troops were pinned down near a bridge, waiting desperately for help.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_117.wav|You are Americans.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_084.wav|I told you of the letter I wrote to President Brezhnev last April, well, I've just sent another message to the Soviet leadership.
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_023.wav|they sought to protect churches from government interference
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_024.wav|I outlined my conviction that our proposals would make not just for a world that feels safer but one that is really safer.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_060.wav|Well, let me just respond with regard to social security.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_017.wav|Inflation remained in double digits, and government spending increased at an annual rate of 17%.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_105.wav|Something that involves Berlin's whole look and feel and way of life.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_246.wav|As we cross this threshold, I ask for your prayers and your support.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_228.wav|Parents who sacrifice long and hard so their children will know a better life than they've known.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_188.wav|The calls for cutting back the defense budget come in nice, simple arithmetic.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_153.wav|We support the effort to chart a course of realistic and effective measures in the quest for peace.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_102.wav|They came the boat people, chancing death for even a glimmer of hope that they could have a new life.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_006.wav|We have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_193.wav|Can human beings manage their own affairs?
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_005.wav|in the past few days,
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_058.wav|You all knew that some things are worth dying for.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_176.wav|For a President, it means protecting his office and its place in our constitutional framework.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_243.wav|No one can quarrel with that.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_004.wav|I'd like to read you a few paragraphs from that letter.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_014.wav|I remember telling you we were in the worst economic mess since the Great Depression.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_087.wav|Well, perhaps that kind of wrath will be deserved if our answer to these serious problems is to repeat the mistakes of the past.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_128.wav|Those who supported the increased revenues swallowed hard to accept $280 billion in outlay cuts.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_187.wav|This reluctance to use those vast resources that our command reminds me of the elderly lady whose home was bombed in the blitz.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_099.wav|They came millions seeking a safe harbor from the oppression of cruel regimes.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_070.wav|And it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_026.wav|We moved arms control forward from where we were last January when the Soviets returned to the table.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_088.wav|Not just in this administration but in future all future administrations.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_166.wav|Do we make port or go a ground on the shores of selfishness, partisanship, and just plain bullheadedness?
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_046.wav|Millions of working poor will be dropped from the tax rolls altogether, and families will get a long overdue break with lower rates and an almost double personal exemption.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_035.wav|I believe that responsibility is shared by all of us here today.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_051.wav|Well, I'm sorry.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_102.wav|They threatened death to any who voted and destroyed hundreds of buses and trucks to keep the people from getting to the polling places.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_002.wav|Out of that change has come great and robust growth in our confidence, our economy and our role in the world.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_244.wav|We must and do have compassion for all the victims of this economic crisis.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_159.wav|Precisely there, our policies have succeeded and we see progress.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_015.wav|if it seeks to do so, it will only sink more deeply into the quagmire that looms before it.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_075.wav|And this brings us back to that so-called greatest tax increase in history and the budget proposals now before the Congress.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_043.wav|The rate of inflation is no longer in double digit figures.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_066.wav|There is no free press in Nicaragua.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_017.wav|Like the National Christmas tree, our country is a living, growing thing planted in rich American soil.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_154.wav|General Secretary Gorbachev mentioned on Sunday a wonderful phrase you have in Russian for this.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_109.wav|Freedom, it has been said, makes people selfish and materialistic.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_134.wav|You could almost feel the possibilities in all that joy.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_067.wav|And the long-term continuing resolution, you had three hours.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_060.wav|And we're now dismantling our even older Titan missiles.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_077.wav|All of these steps are part of a long-term effort to build a more stable relationship with the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_034.wav|We stand on the threshold of a great ability to produce more, do more, be more.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_184.wav|For nearly three decades, these payments steadily increased, and this year will account for 49 percent of the budget.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_127.wav|How we conduct ourselves here in the Western democracies will determine whether this trend continues.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_181.wav|7.7 million elderly citizens who were living in the lowest 20% of earnings.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_139.wav|We know to what happened in the Brezhnev era greater and greater expansionism, Afghanistan, economic decay and overwhelming corruption.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_070.wav|Get others involved with you, clubs, service groups and community organizations, and provide support and strength.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_145.wav|We will also take action to remedy inequities and pensions.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_054.wav|But we were ill-prepared for both.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_016.wav|The American people brought us back.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_098.wav|Well, that won't happen if we act now.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_190.wav|The question before you comes down to this.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_087.wav|And because it's school property, these are the types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_001.wav|I fell in Americans, there's an old saying we've all heard a thousand times about the weather and how everyone talks about it, but no one does anything about it.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_069.wav|So we have embarked on an effort to renew our strength that had fallen dangerously low.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_050.wav|Afghanistan yet it continues a brutal war and props up a regime whose days are clearly numbered.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_028.wav|We're approaching the end of a bloody century plagued by a terrible political invention totalitarianism.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_089.wav|But it would be foolish to pretend that these or any programs cannot be made more efficient and economical.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_219.wav|And so goodbye.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_067.wav|What I want to know is, are you forum or again him?
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_044.wav|I'm confident the truth will come out about this matter as well.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_061.wav|And entire class of nuclear weapons from the face of the earth.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_109.wav|The government is the car and we decide where it should go and by what route and how fast.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_045.wav|First, we and our allies have stood united by the firm commitment that an attack upon any one of us would be considered an attack upon us all.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_007.wav|for our friends in Europe and elsewhere in the Middle East, and for us as Americans.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_161.wav|And our television and radio shows that can be beamed off a satellite in seconds.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_116.wav|The true sources of value found only in family and faith.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_020.wav|Here death ruled, but we've learned something as well.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_080.wav|Mr. Webster has served as director of the FBI and as a U.S. District Court judge.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_017.wav|and we must all rededicate ourselves to the cause of peace.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_135.wav|We, the people, in those other Constitution, the government tells the people of those countries what they're allowed to do.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_014.wav|They're threatening our values and undercutting our institutions.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_192.wav|More attention to American history and a greater emphasis on civic ritual.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_078.wav|As a matter of fact, I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mr. Mondale's running mate said I wasn't a good Christian.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_050.wav|If we look to the answer, as to why for so many years we achieved so much, prospered as no other people on earth.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_011.wav|The university was founding, he called a crowning achievement to a long and well-spent life.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_054.wav|This democratic revolution has been accompanied by a change in economic thinking, comparable to the Newtonian revolution in physics.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_023.wav|You sent a message that you wanted a new beginning.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_084.wav|We did, however, agree to limited revenue increases so long as they didn't harm the incentive features of our economic recovery program.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_136.wav|Japan with a population only about half the size of ours graduates from its universities more engineers than we do.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_116.wav|For the rest of my time I shall do what I can to see.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_098.wav|So, more than 80 percent of the tax bill is not new tax at all, but is better collecting and correcting of flaws in the system.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_006.wav|19 years ago, almost of the day, we lost three astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground, but we've never lost an astronaut in flight.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_176.wav|Our spirit is back, but we haven't re-institutionalized it.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_047.wav|We have to realize inflation itself is a tax, government profits by inflation, but indexing will put a stop to that.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_036.wav|Interest rates continued high, as the months went by, an unemployment increase, particularly in the automobile industry, and housing construction.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_212.wav|Let us now begin a major effort to secure the best, a crusade for freedom that will engage the faith and fortitude of the next generation.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_066.wav|We have not acted in haste, and the steps I will outline tonight and others we may take in the days ahead are firm, just and reasonable.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_094.wav|Our position happened to be at the airport.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_020.wav|Even as we rejoice, however, let us remember that for some Americans this will not be as happy a Christmas as it should be.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_049.wav|it is now urgent that specific arrangements for withdrawal of all foreign forces be agreed upon.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_019.wav|And that is why history will forever brand what happened as the Holocaust.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_126.wav|And now for the first time in history the Soviet Navy is a force to be reckoned with in the South Pacific.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_090.wav|Then they will have no dark alleyways to hide in.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_109.wav|Strange, but my own country, there's been little if any news coverage of that war since the election.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_100.wav|Sound monetary policy is key to long-running economic strength and stability.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_031.wav|And when I saw it, neither could I.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_095.wav|I am also determined to make the congressional oversight process work.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_021.wav|The sign makes this point Poland is not east or west, Poland is at the center of European civilization.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_101.wav|They came those surviving the Holocaust and the Soviet Goulegs.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_147.wav|They can then preserve lower or raised taxes on their own and fund and manage these programs as they see fit.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_009.wav|I am pleased to report the state of our union is stronger than a year ago and growing stronger each day.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_078.wav|No one ever said it could be easy, but we've come a long way.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_109.wav|The United States is also looking forward to beginning negotiations on strategic arms reductions with the Soviet Union in less than two weeks.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_199.wav|And with that thought I realized what a job I had with that letter.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_147.wav|Democracy already flourishes in countries with very different cultures and historical experiences.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_034.wav|There would be more Shuttle flights and more Shuttle crews and yes more volunteers, more civilians, more teachers in space.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_240.wav|Yes, we still have problems plenty of them.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_012.wav|Let me make one thing plain.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_018.wav|Why then should we think that collectively as a nation, we are not bound by that same limitation?
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_052.wav|And that's why we're so deeply concerned by Soviet conduct.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_076.wav|And you will see dozens of churches representing many different beliefs in many places, synagogues and mosques.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_005.wav|They haven't made this the freest country in the mightiest economic force on this planet by shrinking from challenges.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_027.wav|foreign forces and armed factions have too long obstructed the legitimate role of the government of Lebanon's security forces.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_196.wav|Goggle asks what will be its destination.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_105.wav|I signed a bill to reduce the growth of these programs by $44 billion over the next three years.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_086.wav|Because of this, allied forces still stand on this continent.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_153.wav|We're not proposing a quick fix, an artificial stimulus to the economy, such as we've seen in the several recessions in recent years.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_057.wav|I just thought when I came into office, it was time that there was some realistic talk to and about the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_213.wav|Are we not capable of demonstrating our peaceful intentions by applying all our abilities and our ingenuity to achieving a truly lasting stability?
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_053.wav|More broken promises and more unchecked spending.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_048.wav|The target of this depression is the solidarity movement, but in attacking solidarity is enemies attack an entire people.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_108.wav|Something instead that has seen the difficulties of life in Berlin but chose to accept them.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_078.wav|It will encourage more government spending and less private investment.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_026.wav|In Europe, they're calling it the American miracle.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_019.wav|After two days of fighting, only 90 could steal bear arms.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_027.wav|And the freedom to create is the most precious, natural resource.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_013.wav|The revolutionary notion that the people grant government its rights and not the other way around.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_098.wav|Without telling them that if somebody shoots at them, they can darn well shoot back.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_107.wav|The new tax reform will raise in three years, about, as I say, $99 billion.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_024.wav|Recovery from what?
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_019.wav|And by next year, our spending for drug law enforcement will have more than tripled from its 1981 levels.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_023.wav|I explained our proposals for equitable, verifiable and deep reductions.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_118.wav|The only people whose taxes will be increased by this withholding are those who presently are evading their fair share of the tax burden.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_131.wav|No peace-making institution can ignore the use of those dread weapons and still live up to its mission.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_157.wav|The Federal Republic of Germany's political foundations have become a major force in this effort.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_173.wav|It is in homes that freedom built.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_058.wav|Our commitment to a Western hemisphere, safe from aggression, did not occur by spontaneous generation on the day that we took office.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_144.wav|We do not seek to violate the rights of defendants.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_007.wav|We stand on a lonely wind-sweat point on the northern shore of France.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_108.wav|I'm Federal Americans.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_057.wav|We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow whether because of age or need.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_009.wav|The pursuit of science, the study of the great works, the value of free inquiry, in short the very idea of living the life of the mind.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_006.wav|That budget is much more than a long list of numbers.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_062.wav|As I speak, NATO ministers are meeting in Iceland to review the progress of our proposals for eliminating these weapons.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_138.wav|Here's her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_022.wav|first and foremost, we seek the restoration of a strong and stable central government in that country, brought into being by orderly constitutional processes.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_029.wav|This reflects the courage of your people and their devotion to freedom and justice since the war.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_006.wav|I know you've read and heard on the news a variety of statements attributed to various quote authoritative government sources who prefer not to have their names used unquote.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_011.wav|but for the rest of us, there are things that we can learn and things that we must do.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_073.wav|A pessimism in the money markets that we won't stay the course and continue lowering the cost of government.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_056.wav|First, we must understand what's happening at the moment to the economy.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_159.wav|This year I will be asking Congress for the means to do what must be done for the great and good cause.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_018.wav|225 came here.

wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_176.wav|America's economic success is freedom's success.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_079.wav|It is the Soviet Union that runs against the tide of history by denying human freedom and human dignity to its citizens.

wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_118.wav|The Congress can give us these tools, but to make these tools work, it really comes down to just being our best, and that's the core of American greatness.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_078.wav|We still had none.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_059.wav|Failure to cope with this problem now could mean as much as a trillion dollars more in national debt in the next four years alone.

wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_106.wav|All of this is heady, inspiring, and yet my first reflection for you today is, all of it is still in doubt.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_163.wav|And we will submit legislation to provide catastrophic illness insurance coverage for older Americans.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_068.wav|But may I suggest, with no inference that there was wrong intent in the part of those who asked the question, the question was inappropriate to the situation.

wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_065.wav|And then in 1982, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_096.wav|This, like the first footstep on the moon, would be a giant step for mankind.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_178.wav|But we turned it over to a maniacal fanatic who has slaughtered thousands and thousands of people calling it executions.

wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_177.wav|And we see the dream born again in the joyful compassion of a 13-year-old Trevor Ferrell.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_150.wav|With their present margin of superiority, why should they agree to arms reductions knowing that we were prohibited from catching up?
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_216.wav|We speak with pride and admiration of that little band of Americans who overcame insuperable odds to set this nation on course 200 years ago.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_191.wav|Let's start with some basics.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_039.wav|Nations could defend themselves against missile attack, and mankind at long last escaped the prison of mutual terror.

wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_109.wav|I ask you to help make these savings for the American taxpayer.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_091.wav|It's time we ended this huge federal subsidy.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_076.wav|We still had none.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_139.wav|My view is that President Gorbachev is different from previous Soviet leaders.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_154.wav|We will also implement recommendations of our task force on victims of crime which will report to me this week.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_159.wav|Let us finally make the charter live.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_081.wav|Closing our eyes will not make reality disappear.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_120.wav|After seven years, there would be a total of 700,000 ground forces and 900,000 ground and air force personnel combined.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_007.wav|This would impose a tax burden on their federal citizens which is unacceptable.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_032.wav|I'm sure that you appreciate that.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_047.wav|We took 73 billion dollars off last year's deficit compared to the year before.

wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_012.wav|This country was founded on faith in the individual, not groups or classes, but faith in the resources and bounty of each and every separate human soul.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_047.wav|For example, in the next three years, the committee measure projects spending $141 billion more than does the bipartisan substitute.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_085.wav|It's a simple straightforward yet historic message.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_010.wav|We suffer from the longest and one of the worst sustained inflation in our national history.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_206.wav|History recalls his greatness in ways no dictator will ever know.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_025.wav|Out of the ashes, hope, and from all the pain promise.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_181.wav|So we've got to teach history based not on what's in fashion, but what's important.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_121.wav|Excellence is what makes freedom ring, and isn't that what we do best.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_146.wav|Surely no people on Earth hate war or love peace more than we Americans.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_109.wav|But we went in in the interest of peace and to keep Israel and Syria from getting into the sixth war between them.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_094.wav|I have created the post of NSC legal advisor to assure a greater sensitivity to matters of law.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_094.wav|This would be an historic step.

wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_093.wav|We were there for the better part of a year.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_125.wav|But this is just the point.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_007.wav|The impossible became the inevitable and the dream of America's fair share tax plan became a reality.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_012.wav|But it wasn't long ago that we looked out on a different land.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_059.wav|One thing still upsetting me, however, is that no one kept proper records of meetings or decisions.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_043.wav|Now, this too was to be implemented over a three-year period.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_074.wav|The economy, bloomed like a plant that had been cut back and could now grow quicker and stronger.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_072.wav|Well, you're the combat veterans, and you have a critical role to play.

wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_111.wav|All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_061.wav|All of you were willing to fight tyranny, and you knew the people of your countries were behind you.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_213.wav|With firmness and dedication, we'll continue to negotiate.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_025.wav|Gladstone defending the reform bill of 1860, 60, declared you cannot fight against the future.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_003.wav|I aborted an investigation.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_158.wav|Nothing will have a higher priority for me and for the American people over the coming months and years.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_068.wav|We've concluded a new agreement designed to bring the best of America's artists and academics to the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_036.wav|our nation too has a legacy of evil with which it must deal
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_126.wav|I won't count if you don't.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_088.wav|Even though I have submitted it within the Graham Rudman Hollings deficit reduction target, I have seen suggestions that we might post-pone that timetable.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_179.wav|But through low tax rates and free markets, they've soared ahead of centralized economies.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_202.wav|Our foreign policy must be rooted in realism, not naivete or self-delusion.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_013.wav|Each time unemployment increased and inflation soon turned up again.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_082.wav|They are the ones, the only ones who weigh the evidence and decide on guilt or innocence.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_158.wav|But not everyone can travel across the continents and oceans.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_082.wav|For many months now, we've been working to get a compromised budget that would further reduce spending and thus reduce the deficits.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_005.wav|The man to whom that mind belongs is known to you as Mr. Jefferson.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_195.wav|Our armed forces are finally properly paid.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_007.wav|Why doesn't he just speak to us as he has in the past when we've faced troubles or tragedies?
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_120.wav|And they're right.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_161.wav|But you can bet it's rising because my fellow citizens America isn't finished.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_084.wav|First, in my budget message, I will recommend a federal spending freeze.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_030.wav|And I do mean personal experience.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_162.wav|Letting them know that you understand that this legislation is a price worth paying for lower interest rates, economic recovery, and more jobs.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_039.wav|The men who rule them and their totalitarian allies fear the very freedom that the Polish people cherish.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_099.wav|Now I think much of the reason for all of this has to do with the new coherence and clarity that we brought to our foreign policy.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_109.wav|We find 35 states with task forces now dealing with their educational problems.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_096.wav|But we did not engage in conflict that was out of line with our mission.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_053.wav|I tried to be very clear about where our sympathies lie.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_057.wav|Well, I can tell you they are good and dedicated government employees who put in long hours for the nation's benefit.
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_031.wav|i urge the congress to begin hearings into adopt legislation that will protect the right of life to all children including the disabled or handicapped

wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_104.wav|Certainly, there's a great deal to be said for your fortitude, for your defiant courage, but I believe there's something deeper.

wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_023.wav|And a revolution that carries beyond our shores, the golden promise of human freedom in a world at peace.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_004.wav|I have seen Germany united, divided and united again.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_084.wav|The fact is every new day begins with possibilities.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_075.wav|Keeping America strong, free, and at peace is solely the responsibility of the federal government.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_076.wav|We are suspending the right of Poland's fishing fleet to operate in American waters.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_061.wav|And citizens of the Soviet Union need to know of America's deep desire for peace and our unwavering attachment to freedom.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_202.wav|They would know all about our problems.
wavs/reagan_1994_016.wav|I know young America's foundation was active in those efforts and I congratulate you on your vigilance.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_016.wav|And that's what we've seen, but is what we can never understand as the victims did.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_106.wav|And so the terrorist acts began and led to the one great tragedy when they were killed in that suicide bombing the building.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_131.wav|If this gives up their benefits by the end of March.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_090.wav|I'll stand in my record on that and if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, I'll do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_115.wav|As we do, all this will continue to protect our natural resources.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_096.wav|Our reluctance for conflicts should not be misjudged as a failure of will.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_194.wav|All great change in America begins at the dinner table.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_030.wav|The goals were worthy.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_029.wav|Six out of 10 Americans were saying they were pessimistic about their future.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_139.wav|Now I'm not capable and I don't think you are any of us to make this determination that must be made with regard to human life.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_165.wav|We must and shall see that those basic laws that guarantee equal rights are preserved and when necessary strengthen.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_080.wav|This is reality.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_004.wav|It's been the honor of my life to be your president.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_100.wav|The taxpayers aren't the only victims of this kind of abuse.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_026.wav|Our goal is in America in which every citizen who needs and wants a job can get a job.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_245.wav|There will be risks and results take time, but I believe we can do it.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_097.wav|It is widely said that America is losing her competitive edge.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_128.wav|Strategic arms reduction talks.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_177.wav|Now, some of those I met were a little surprised that I didn't apologize for America's wealth.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_017.wav|It is every American, indeed every human life ever touched with a daring idea of self-government that Mr. Jefferson has influenced.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_018.wav|He said to those who challenged the truth of those words, let me point out at the end of World War II, we were the only undamaged industrial power in the world.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_068.wav|The neighboring country of Austria has opened her doors to refugees from Poland.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_093.wav|We cannot and we will not accept tax reform that is a tax increase in disguise.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_064.wav|I believe quite simply that we can help them quit, and that's where you come in.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_146.wav|These initiatives will be joined by others to continue our efforts to promote equity for women.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_139.wav|None has more threatened our sense of national well-being than the explosion of violent crime.

wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_025.wav|From a 1980 recession that saw inflation in double-digit figures for the second year in a row, it was 12.4% when we arrived.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_090.wav|This compromise adds up to a total over three years of a $380 billion reduction in the budget deficits.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_064.wav|And that is of interest to the whole Western world and the industrialized nations because of the great supply of energy on which so many depend there.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_159.wav|Our men and women in uniform at last are getting the tools and training they need to do their job.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_083.wav|I want to be clear and concise.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_076.wav|It is government's prime responsibility.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_039.wav|We maintain the peace through our strength.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_047.wav|We're offering to permit Soviet experts to see firsthand that SDI does not involve offensive weapons.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_092.wav|But there's only one way to see to it that these programs really help those whom they were designed to help and that is to bring their spiraling costs under control.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_166.wav|Even in arms reduction, a President's ability to succeed depends on congressional support for military modernization.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_075.wav|The Soviets had over 800 warheads.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_096.wav|More recently, we've seen evidence of this same human impulse in one of the developing nations in Central America.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_152.wav|And the individuals can't complain because of their illegal status.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_098.wav|Freedom is the recognition that no single person, no single authority or government has a monopoly on the truth.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_088.wav|We need your success as well as ours.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_061.wav|President Truman was very blunt.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_070.wav|Again, let me say, the main obstacle to their doing so is continued high interest rates.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_065.wav|Actually, the discussion has to do with how much of a tax increase should be imposed on the taxpayer in 1982.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_160.wav|When you told your representatives you wanted it.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_121.wav|It comes not from the literature of America, but from this country, from one of the greatest writers of the 20th century.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_075.wav|It's time, as Nancy said, for America to just say no to drugs.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_171.wav|Now, I don't wish to sound overly optimistic, yet the Soviet Union is not immune from the reality of what is going on in the world.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_027.wav|The midway sent a small launch to bring them to the ship and safety.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_059.wav|I will say to you tonight what I've said before and will continue to say the budget process has broken down.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_052.wav|It was proposed as a package and it has been supported as such by the American people.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_047.wav|We have made a new beginning, but we have only begun.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_166.wav|We were taught very directly what it means to be an American.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_147.wav|I can understand why you are Mr. Mondale because as a senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_142.wav|Over the next four years the states can use this money in either of two ways.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_021.wav|Your voices have been heard.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_157.wav|In our discussion today, we agreed on working up to several thousand exchanges a year from each country in the near future.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_119.wav|Love of country rediscovered by our young who are leading the way.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_012.wav|Well, you're not alone in feeling his presence.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_098.wav|Where do we go from here?
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_051.wav|I have to get used to saying that, to begin working with congressional authors and committees for bipartisan legislation conforming to these principles.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_018.wav|Yes, Mr. Jefferson was obliged to admit all previous attempts at popular government, had proven themselves failures.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_104.wav|What an insult it will be to what we are and once we came, if we do not rise up together in defiance against this cancer of drugs.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_104.wav|We are bound today by what bound us 40 years ago, the same loyalties, traditions, and beliefs.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_162.wav|Nothing would please us more than for the Soviet people to get to know us better and to understand our way of life.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_089.wav|We will again be the exemplar of freedom and a beacon of hope for those who do not now have freedom.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_026.wav|It was a world where our children came of age under the threat of nuclear holocaust.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_015.wav|It's easy to underestimate because it's not accompanied by banners or fanfare.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_030.wav|Twice in my lifetime, I have seen the peoples of Europe plunged into the tragedy of war.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_055.wav|That is no accident.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_084.wav|Yes, Graham Rudman Hollings has been profoundly helpful but let us take its goal of a balanced budget and make it permanent.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_152.wav|These accords have not yet been translated into living reality.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_159.wav|Finally, there is a great tradition of warnings in presidential farewells and I've got one that's been on my mind for some time.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_152.wav|But in observation, I've had my share of victories in the Congress, but what few people noticed is that I never won anything you didn't win for me.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_060.wav|It needs a drastic overhaul.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_083.wav|My budget honors that pledge.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_134.wav|And I still want to see the base of the economy broadened so that the individual's tax burden can be further reduced.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_222.wav|Right now we need both realism and idealism.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_013.wav|It involves many members of this body.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_031.wav|Some said our domestic problems were uncontrollable, that we had to learn to live with this seemingly endless cycle of high inflation and high unemployment.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_188.wav|But now the Federal Republic of Germany and Japan are two of our closest allies and friends.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_040.wav|All must share in the productive work of this new beginning and all must share in the bounty of a revived economy.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_024.wav|The unemployment rate still too high is the lowest in nearly seven years, and our people have created nearly 13 million new jobs.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_074.wav|And freedom itself is transforming the globe.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_013.wav|Let's talk about getting spending and inflation under control and cutting your tax rates.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_171.wav|In conquering the frontier, we cannot write off our traditional industries.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_151.wav|Now the social security tax of 77.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_133.wav|We Americans are still the technological leaders in most fields.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_010.wav|To those listening throughout Eastern Europe, I extend my warmest greetings and the good will of the American people.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_035.wav|As I speak to you tonight, the fate of a proud and ancient nation hangs in the balance.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_088.wav|Isn't this the calling that unites us?
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_052.wav|I urge the Polish government and its allies to consider the consequences of their actions.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_030.wav|Think how far we've come from that time when despair made these tragic victims wonder if anything could survive.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_049.wav|First, we seek a drug-free workplace at all levels of government and in the private sector.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_075.wav|This relatively limited force in no way serves as a substitute for the much larger strategic umbrella spread over our NATO Allies.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_214.wav|Let us begin in unity with justice and love.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_027.wav|I've always had great faith in and respect for our space program.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_022.wav|We have an economic program in place, completely different from the artificial quick fixes of the past.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_122.wav|Our approach to verification will be to emphasize openness and creativity rather than the secrecy and suspicion which have undermined confidence in arms control in the past.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_075.wav|In an ironic sense Karl Marx was right.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_056.wav|Something American families do and the federal government can't has caused crisis after crisis in this city.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_155.wav|At the same time every year it increased the amount of money.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_211.wav|And that's a sad commentary on the human condition.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_093.wav|I think sometimes Mr. Mondale's running away from his.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_089.wav|Now let's consider conventional forces.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_008.wav|It has been said that an institution is the lengthening shadow of a man.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_234.wav|But we must and can give them good reason to be hopeful.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_062.wav|I am especially anxious to end the agony of Lebanon because it is both right and in our national interest.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_186.wav|Her name was Lisa Zanada Hen.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_074.wav|Reach out a hand when they fall.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_043.wav|The Polish government has trampled underfoot solemn commitments to the UN Charter and the Helsinki Accords.
wavs/reagan_1994_009.wav|Well, you and I knew better.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_081.wav|It must make fundamental changes or it will become obsolete.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_097.wav|Now, this is also a matter of simple fairness.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_032.wav|It's time for America to be all that we can be.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_032.wav|Our founding fathers fought not only for our political rights, but also to secure the economic freedoms without which these political freedoms are no more than a shadow.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_016.wav|Farther south, there may be no visible, no obvious wall, but the remain armed guards and checkpoints all the same.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_002.wav|Usually I talk with you from my office in the west wing of the white house, but tonight there's something special to talk about, and I've asked someone very special to join me.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_142.wav|Our inspectors general have been mobilized in with task force aimed at ferriting out waste and fraud.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_084.wav|And I'm now asking you, the Congress, to keep its end to the bargain.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_041.wav|Curing those problems has taken more time and a higher toll than any of us wanted.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_017.wav|Still a restriction on the right to travel.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_050.wav|When it came to managing the NSC staff, let's face it, my style didn't match its previous track record.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_196.wav|Tonight I have spoken of great plans and great dreams.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_114.wav|It's one of the significant areas of non-compliance and is costing the government about $9 billion a year.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_009.wav|You will continue to receive your checks in the full amount do you.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_057.wav|The answer to a government that is too big is to stop feeding its growth.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_206.wav|At the heart of our strategy for peace is our relationship with the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_165.wav|That prestigious gathering could consider ways to help democratic political movements.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_087.wav|This treaty ended nuclear weapons testing in the atmosphere, outer space, or underwater by participating nations.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_200.wav|Part of the exodus that followed the fall of Saigon.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_118.wav|There on the western front, he was killed trying to carry a message between battalions under heavy artillery fire.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_046.wav|One of the great unnoticed and yet most startling developments of this decade is this.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_049.wav|Ten million of Poland's 36 million citizens are members of solidarity taken together with their families.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_052.wav|The picture is even brighter.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_160.wav|In late spring, 37 years ago, representatives of 50 nations gathered on the other side of this continent in the San Francisco Opera House.
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_059.wav|one of our founding fathers
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_087.wav|A magic of opportunity, unreserved unfailing, unrestrained.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_013.wav|Presidents know about this too.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_138.wav|Unfortunately a decade of neglecting our military forces had called into question our ability to do that.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_133.wav|Our NATO allies have assumed a great defense burden including the military draft in most countries.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_048.wav|And if you ask them the secret of their success, they'll tell you it's all that they learned in their struggles along the way.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_054.wav|As I indicated in my first state of the union, what ails us can be simply put.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_069.wav|Let me add, those representatives honestly and sincerely want to know your feelings.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_135.wav|We have repeatedly protested to the Soviet government as well as to the governments of Laos and Vietnam, their use of chemical and toxin weapons.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_122.wav|Memory fills that room and more than anything that memory drives us to see vividly what President Lincoln sought to save.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_055.wav|Some pundits said our programs would result in catastrophe.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_085.wav|No more than I don't agree to all of those things.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_073.wav|We had none.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_085.wav|Today it takes less than a third.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_091.wav|We will protect them.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_037.wav|A man who understands government, who understands our country and who understands the world.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_012.wav|the people of Lebanon must have learned that the cycle of massacre upon massacre must end.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_076.wav|We will not do this by raising taxes.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_043.wav|Only this time is not just a single nation at issue.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_045.wav|That any issue that comes before me, I have instructed cabinet members and staff.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_032.wav|It knows no sectional boundaries or ethnic and racial divisions, and it crosses political party lines.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_028.wav|The cost of achieving these ends is totaled up, and the result is the budget for national defense.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_118.wav|I think we have stopped a lot of what needed stopping.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_152.wav|What happens in the next few years, whether all this progress is continued or ended, this is in large part up to us.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_142.wav|I think what I've just been talking about is Paris Stryker and what his goals are.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_096.wav|And this will take deeds, not words alone.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_140.wav|A quality education initiative to encourage a substantial upgrading of math and science instruction through block grants to the states.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_123.wav|He writes,
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_037.wav|But with our program in place, it won't be quite as big as it might have been.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_106.wav|The strength of America's allies is vital to the United States and the American security guarantee is essential to the continued freedom of Europe's democracies.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_052.wav|Our fourth goal is to expand international cooperation while treating drug trafficking as a threat to our national security.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_006.wav|Now however, the union demands are 17 times what had been agreed to $681 million.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_035.wav|the essential precondition for extending its control over the entire country.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_031.wav|The cost of government was increasing at a rate of 17% a year.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_110.wav|Someone you know has said that he who would have nothing to do with thorns must never attempt to gather flowers.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_131.wav|But since the death of Stalin, the Soviet state would have to evolve into a more moderate and status quo power in accordance with some vague theory of convergence.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_112.wav|It was the American people who in reaching for excellence knew to reach back to basics.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_118.wav|You're the product of the freest society mankind has ever known.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_160.wav|We are not asking them to replace discarded and often discredited government programs dollar for dollar service for service.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_136.wav|Butch says that suicide and urges him to jump.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_071.wav|Real respect for human rights and more open contacts between our societies and, of course, arms reduction.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_107.wav|Recently we released our annual survey of what graduating high school seniors have to say about drugs.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_040.wav|They have answered the stirrings of liberty with brute force, killings, mass arrests, and the setting up of concentration camps.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_031.wav|But where they see only problems, I see possibilities as vast and diverse as the American family itself.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_111.wav|Now, Soviet spokesmen have suggested that moving their SS-20s behind the Euro-Mounts will remove the threat to Europe.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_021.wav|I brought these questions to the summit and put them before Mr. Gorbachev.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_040.wav|At the end of just one day of battle, 10,500 Americans were wounded, missing or killed in what became known as the Normandy Landing.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_043.wav|While the world is safer, it is not safe.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_229.wav|And that depreciation is, of course, the amount of inflation.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_216.wav|Once said that America has never forgotten the nobler things that brought her into being and that light her path.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_125.wav|It's not an act of belligerence to speak to the fundamental differences between totalitarianism and democracy.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_070.wav|so tonight, I ask for your prayers and your support as our country continues its vital role as a leader for world peace.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_114.wav|Grenade doesn't even have an air force.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_058.wav|Well, nothing could be more tragic after having come all this way on the journey of renewal we began 12 years ago.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_126.wav|God bless you and good night.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_129.wav|The third proposal I have made to the Soviet Union is that we act to achieve equality at lower levels of conventional forces in Europe.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_031.wav|We were living, he said, in the best of times and the worst of times.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_049.wav|They can preserve it for generations to come, so long as we pursue them with sufficient will and vigor.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_030.wav|With regard to social security, I hope there will be more time than just this minute to mention that, but I will say this.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_111.wav|Finally, let's stop suppressing the spiritual core of our national being.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_007.wav|The society we heard from is made up of millions of compassionate Americans and their children from college age to kindergarten.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_056.wav|Well, last week it was 14.5%, and as of today, three major banks have lowered it to 14%.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_107.wav|They now enjoy a superiority on the order of 6 to 1.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_038.wav|It will bring much closer the safer, more stable world that we seek.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_037.wav|You see my thinking on the next year is quite simple.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_110.wav|Now, perhaps they'll say it's well because there aren't newer struggles now distant islands in the South Atlantic.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_160.wav|But now at length I have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a setting son.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_085.wav|I know there's a strong medicine, but so far we have only cut the rate of increase in federal spending.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_073.wav|With our budget cuts, we presented a complete program of reduction in tax rates.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_104.wav|Next year, even after this new tax bill is passed, the savings will almost double.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_085.wav|We will continue to redirect our resources to our two highest budget priorities.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_079.wav|Otherwise, we're building a paper castle that will be blown away by the winds of war.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_023.wav|It calls for a reduction of the rate of increase in government spending, and already that rate has been cut nearly in half.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_052.wav|It was loyalty and love.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_235.wav|We of this Congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_088.wav|The people's right of assembly is guaranteed in the constitution and protected by the police.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_008.wav|People were brought here for no other purpose, but to suffer and die.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_078.wav|And we've made important gains.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_218.wav|All in all, not bad, not bad at all.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_056.wav|And we're going to continue along that line.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_088.wav|The first and most important point concerns the Geneva negotiations.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_124.wav|We Americans have never been morally neutral against any form of tyranny.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_141.wav|The amount and type of military spending by a country is important for the world to know as a measure of its intentions and the threat that country may pose to its neighbors.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_114.wav|Thank you very much and God bless you all.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_075.wav|Except that if he had had his way when the Nimitz was being planned, he would have been deep in the water out there because there wouldn't have been any Nimitz to stand on.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_123.wav|Yes, this had to do with our dishonorment talks.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_073.wav|Well this is precisely our mission today to preserve freedom as well as peace.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_021.wav|I've studied the Board's report, its findings are honest, convincing, and highly critical, and I accept them.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_023.wav|They are why we say tonight, private values must be at the heart of public policies.

wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_132.wav|I think this is wrong.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_187.wav|Even with the increase that I am requesting this year, defense will still amount to only 28 percent of the budget.

wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_153.wav|I am proposing an increased exchange program of high school students between our countries.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_116.wav|We are also prepared to discuss other elements of the strategic balance.

wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_215.wav|The process has already begun and we'll see its effect as the year goes on.

wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_019.wav|I've been thinking a bit at that window.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_016.wav|From the beginning of our administration, we've taken strong steps to do something about this horror.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_104.wav|Hours was the first revolution in the history of mankind that truly reversed the course of government and with three little words.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_151.wav|We need the bipartisan comprehensive package of revenue increases and spending cuts.

wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_084.wav|I am considering other changes in personnel and I'll move more furniture as I see fit in the weeks and months ahead.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_024.wav|End of statement.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_059.wav|They are the inheritance of decades of tax and tax and spend and spend.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_033.wav|Japan rose from ruin to become an economic giant.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_126.wav|I will ask for new negotiating authority to remove barriers and to get more of our products into foreign markets.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_095.wav|With Soviet agreement, we could together substantially reduce the dread threat of nuclear war which hangs over the people of Europe.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_021.wav|Now that's the equivalent of multi-millionaires today.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_072.wav|But part of the problem is psychological.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_188.wav|As the rescuers moved about, they found a bottle of brandy she'd stored behind the staircase, which was all that was left standing.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_007.wav|I went on in my letter to say, the people of the world still share that hope.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_044.wav|It began with a 5% cut in the personal income tax beginning October 1, 1981.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_035.wav|We maintain our strength in order to deter and defend against aggression, to preserve freedom and peace.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_017.wav|Yes, we will have our differences but let us always remember what unites us far outweighs whatever divides us.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_207.wav|And if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors, and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_128.wav|Well, from time to time, I've been with them they will ask about our Constitution, and I hope you members of Congress will not deem this a breach of protocol.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_159.wav|Addressing the United Nations 20 years ago, another American president described the goal that we still pursue today.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_078.wav|And we're about to begin new negotiations on the conventional balance in Europe.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_168.wav|The first flowering of the man-made miracles of high technology, a field pioneered and still led by our country.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_116.wav|I went into politics in part to put up my hand and say stop.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_121.wav|These pictures only tell a small part of the story.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_058.wav|Meet our commitment to protect social security and the truly less fortunate.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_167.wav|In the next spring there will be a conference of world authorities on constitutionalism and self-government hosted by the Chief Justice of the United States.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_046.wav|I can feel the suffering of millions.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_013.wav|you know the facts, there is no need to recite the historical record,
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_052.wav|As I said earlier, there are those who say it's been tried and it failed.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_017.wav|It was their faith in freedom and love of country that sustained us through trials and hardships and through wars.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_061.wav|And that plan is based on four common-sense fundamentals.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_083.wav|We are always willing to be trade partners.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_024.wav|I never ever conceived of such a thing.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_097.wav|For months and months, the world news media covered the fighting in El Salvador.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_028.wav|That commitment is as strong today as it ever was.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_042.wav|Unemployment is far too high.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_132.wav|Also there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_105.wav|The acres and acres of antenna fields and intelligence monitors are targeted on key US military installations and sensitive activities.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_053.wav|Well, as Al Smith used to say, let's look at the record.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_029.wav|Specifically, I want to present our program for preserving peace in Europe and our wider program for arms control.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_102.wav|As Charles Dickens, whom I quoted a few moments ago said so well in a Christmas carol, God bless us everyone.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_051.wav|In the nuclear era, the major powers bear a special responsibility to ease these sources of conflict and to refrain from aggression.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_157.wav|I believe the time is right to move forward on arms control and the resolution of critical regional disputes at the conference table.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_067.wav|They came from the heart of a great nation.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_096.wav|And each amazing achievement became commonplace until the next new challenge was raised.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_100.wav|We urge the Soviet Union to date a join with us in this quest.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_112.wav|There's can be known by the company they keep.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_105.wav|We will not gamble with our national survival.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_094.wav|And now that resolve has paid off.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_033.wav|Because of this cooperation, we've come a long distance in less than three months.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_090.wav|The entitlement programs that make up our safety net for the truly needy have worthy goals and many deserving recipients.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_047.wav|And yet, if I looked up into the heavens, I think that it will all come right.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_126.wav|And after all, why shouldn't we believe that?
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_063.wav|We seek to create a massive change in national attitudes which ultimately will separate the drugs from the customer, to take the user away from the supply.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_171.wav|So far, I've concentrated largely now on domestic matters.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_061.wav|Had that nuclear monopoly been in the hands of the communist world, the map of Europe indeed the world would look very different today.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_020.wav|They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_036.wav|And the nation and the world are watching to see if we go forward together in the national interest or if we let partisanship weaken us.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_064.wav|All of this, in only 10 months, hardly looks like a program that failed to me.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_163.wav|President Harry Truman spoke of the revival of an old faith.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_078.wav|This is called bracket creep.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_085.wav|We will begin that deployment late this year.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_045.wav|I went further in expressing our peaceful intentions.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_009.wav|People ask how I feel about leaving and the fact is parting is such sweet sorrow.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_107.wav|And the only way to make it last and grow and become permanent is to remember we're not there yet.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_190.wav|I'm warning of an eradication of that, of the American memory that could result ultimately in an erosion of the American spirit.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_068.wav|Let us pledge ourselves to a new beginning for them.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_096.wav|True reform must be truly fair, and that means raising personal exemptions to $2,000.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_112.wav|Well, there is no truth whatsoever to that.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_168.wav|Together, we can reach that goal.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_110.wav|During the past two years the level of Soviet arms exports to Cuba can only be compared to the levels reached during the Cuban missile crisis 20 years ago.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_060.wav|Second, because our economic problems are deeply rooted and will not respond to quick political fixes, we must stick to our carefully integrated plan for recovery.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_034.wav|I know we always have, but in the past few years, the world again and in a way we ourselves rediscovered it.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_137.wav|But Sundance still refuses and finally admits, I can't swim.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_075.wav|This is designed to set up cooperative measures to improve civil air safety in that region of the Pacific.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_021.wav|Well, the results are something which we can all be proud.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_093.wav|For armored vehicles including tanks we've produced 11,200.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_177.wav|But what if you're one time allies?
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_113.wav|And there is a government that you can see and can put your hand on.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_074.wav|And that is an image of strength.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_069.wav|And so the whole matter of what to do with social security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_037.wav|Tonight let us speak of our responsibility to redefine government's role.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_086.wav|We have had great success in restoring our economic integrity, and we have rescued our nation from the worst economic mess since the depression.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_053.wav|The question we had to ask 12 years ago is the question we ask today.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_114.wav|In the terrorist situation, there are terrorist factions all over in a recent 30-day period.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_055.wav|We are today subsidizing housing for more than 10 million people.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_186.wav|We look at you and know it's true in this land of dreams fulfilled where greater dreams may be imagined.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_132.wav|Indeed the growth of these grants has led to the distortion in the vital functions of government.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_034.wav|Well, those predictions were wrong.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_157.wav|Today it is up to about $38,000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for social security.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_111.wav|Our foreign relations embrace this expanding world of democracy that I've described.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_030.wav|Yet optimism is in order because day by day democracy is proving itself to be a not at all fragile flower.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_158.wav|We in America now intend to take additional steps as many of our allies have already done toward realizing this same goal.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_068.wav|Yes, three hours to consider each.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_069.wav|Also that night General Matthew Richway on his cot, listening in the darkness for the promise God made to Joshua,
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_038.wav|They have been betrayed by their own government.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_107.wav|And she told the guerrillas, you can kill me, you can kill my family, kill my neighbors, but you can't kill us all.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_018.wav|I know that in the last few weeks you've been bombarded with numbers and percentages, some say we need only a 5% increase in defense spending.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_063.wav|But I never thought it was my style or the words I used that made a difference.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_192.wav|And that's going to continue to be strong.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_056.wav|But on one point all of us are united.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_161.wav|It is a strategic defense initiative aimed ultimately at finding a non-nuclear defense against ballistic missiles.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_134.wav|We're working with them and our other friends around the world to do more.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_080.wav|Steps will be taken aimed at restoring the balance between the various levels of government.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_031.wav|Well, our concern must be for a special interest group that has been too long neglected.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_112.wav|Our nation could not have been conceived without divine help.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_105.wav|And if you've lived your life properly, so you learn.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_121.wav|I think that we're out in front of most.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_033.wav|There are reasons why it happened, but no excuses.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_011.wav|The Allies had been told that some of the mightiest of these guns were here and they would be trained on the beaches to stop the Allied advance.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_058.wav|Government spending has been growing faster than the economy itself.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_065.wav|Democracy is the standard by which governments are measured.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_076.wav|But I will need an American negotiator's in Geneva, will need Congress support.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_092.wav|Now, let me take that $99 billion tax program apart and you decide whether it's the biggest tax increase in history.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_058.wav|During the past decade and a half the Soviets have built up a massive arsenal of new strategic nuclear weapons, weapons that can strike directly at the United States.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_149.wav|Wherever there's oppression, we must strive for the peace and security of individuals as well as states.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_002.wav|the scenes that the whole world witnessed this past weekend were among the most heart-rending in the long nightmare of Lebanon's agony.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_178.wav|Freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of enterprise, and freedom is special and rare.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_154.wav|It had several tax increases phased in over a period of time there are two more yet to come between now and eight and 1989.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_169.wav|As Jefferson himself said, the transaction of business with foreign nations is executive altogether.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_229.wav|Church and civic volunteers who helped to feed, cloth, nurse and teach the needy.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_019.wav|It was in recognition of this that the Congress passed a law forbidding strikes by government employees against the public safety.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_213.wav|History is asking us once again to be a force for good in the world.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_176.wav|With braver like you or Shelby, America need never fear for our future.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_056.wav|For 20 years the Soviet Union has been accumulating enormous military night.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_006.wav|For the past three months, I've been silent on the revelations about Iran, and you must have been thinking, well, why doesn't he tell us what's happening?
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_002.wav|This was the culmination of seven months of negotiations between the federal aviation administration and the union.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_035.wav|That was the spending necessary to restore our nation's defenses, which had been allowed to deteriorate to a dangerous degree in the preceding four years.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_090.wav|Well, today, three decades later, that is still true.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_091.wav|By contrast the Soviet Union has produced twice as many.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_009.wav|accepted his invitation to go to maska,
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_039.wav|So prosperity can come about only when the farmer and businessmen enjoy economic freedom.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_025.wav|And I'm pleased to report tonight that General Secretary Gorbachev and I did make a measure of progress here.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_033.wav|What I've said it before and I'll say it again.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_085.wav|The Soviets must know that if America reduces her defenses, it will be because of a reduced threat, not a reduced resolve.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_105.wav|The United States and its allies have made specific, reasonable and equitable proposals.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_050.wav|As it did 12 years ago, and as we have seen many times in history, our country now stands at a crossroads.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_210.wav|Supported by our allies, we put forward draft agreements proposing significant weapon reductions to equal and verifiable lower levels.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_016.wav|But what is best, there are no republicans, no Democrats, just Americans.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_040.wav|I will not recite all of this here again today, but I do want you to know I found in the delegates afterward a warmth that I had not seen before.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_116.wav|Please remember this when your courage is tested.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_030.wav|And more often than not, it is inflation and taxes that have undermined livelihoods and constrained their freedoms.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_087.wav|I expect a covert policy that if Americans saw it on the front page of their newspaper, they'd say that makes sense.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_051.wav|And I'll oppose with all my might any attempt to raise tax rates on the American people, and I hope that all here will join with me to make permanent.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_105.wav|We've always reached for a new spirit and aimed at a higher goal.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_090.wav|My country remains deeply committed to those objectives today and to strengthening the non-proliferation framework.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_132.wav|Many countries have written into their Constitution provisions for freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_062.wav|But just as we have led the crusade for democracy beyond our shores, we have a great task to do together in our own home.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_022.wav|There are still almost eight million unemployed.
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_044.wav|america has kept a light that torches freedom but not just for ourselves but for millions of others around the world
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_031.wav|They now produce over a million for less than a penny a piece.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_109.wav|Within the new bill, there has, of course, been disagreement over some of the specific provisions.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_097.wav|International sports competitions of all kinds could take place in both parts of this city.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_059.wav|early in the summer, our government met its responsibility to help resolve a severe crisis and to relieve the Lebanese people of the crushing burden.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_080.wav|The economic recovery package that I have outlined a year over the past few weeks is, I deeply believe, the only answer that we have left.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_170.wav|The movies celebrated democratic values and implicitly reinforced the idea that America was special.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_069.wav|Go to his help or to hers.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_028.wav|I saw a display commemorating this 40th anniversary of the Marshall Plan.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_014.wav|The record of history is clear, citizens of the United States resort to force reluctantly and only when they must.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_221.wav|I know this is a formidable technical task, one that may not be accomplished before the end of this century.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_019.wav|My fellow citizens, this nation is poised for greatness.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_053.wav|We do not face large deficits because American families are under taxed.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_192.wav|America's hopes rest with us.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_094.wav|But I'm running on the record of what we have asked for.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_026.wav|From Central America to East Asia, ideas like free markets and democratic reforms and human rights are taking hold.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_146.wav|I know too that many of you seriously believe that a nuclear freeze would further the cause of peace.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_106.wav|You put things in perspective.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_122.wav|But the waste in dollars and cents pales before the most tragic loss, the sinful waste of human spirit and potential.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_054.wav|I told them that I wanted a policy that was as justifiable and understandable in public as it was in secret.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_051.wav|Third, we want to ensure that the public is protected and the treatment is available to substance abusers and the chemically dependent.
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_027.wav|the supreme court opens its proceedings with a religious invocation and the members of congress open their sessions with a prayer
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_011.wav|There's been enough of that.
wavs/reagan_1994_003.wav|Together we work to accomplish much of what has come to be known as the Reagan Revolution.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_053.wav|Now they claim they are not.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_058.wav|One year ago, they were paying 15.5%.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_029.wav|the place to begin this task is in Beirut.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_096.wav|20 million perished, a terrible price that testifies to all the world and necessity of ending war.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_077.wav|Well, the answer is an unequivocal and emphatic yes.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_123.wav|I wonder if they have ever asked themselves that if they should have the kind of government they apparently seek.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_160.wav|And that is why we would like to make available to this country more of our 11,000 magazines and periodicals.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_012.wav|I hope you get well quick.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_029.wav|Well, today, many have not yet seen how advances in technology are transforming our lives.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_026.wav|Most important, America is at peace tonight, and freedom is on the march.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_018.wav|No bigger than a fingerprint.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_103.wav|And of course, I've heard the message from you, the American people.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_140.wav|American planes that couldn't fly and American ships that couldn't sail for lack of spare parts and trained personnel and insufficient fuel and ammunition for essential training.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_022.wav|A small story about a big ship and a refugee and a sailor.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_187.wav|We cannot play innocence abroad in a world that's not innocent.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_057.wav|Those countries which respect the rights of their own people tended evitably to respect.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_095.wav|This is the time to reform this outmoded social dinosaur and finally break the poverty trap.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_043.wav|So the facts here will be left to the continuing investigations of the court appointed independent council and the two congressional investigating committees.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_115.wav|The fighting in Lebanon and the part of all parties must stop, and Israel should bring its forces home.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_067.wav|My country learned a bitter lesson in this century.
wavs/reagan_1994_011.wav|A few months after our election, I went to the University of Notre Dame and warned of the evil empire.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_108.wav|Some new but others long recommended by your own congressional committees.

wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_151.wav|Our alliances are stronger than ever.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_126.wav|And we know that there are even those who strive and suffer for freedom within the confines of the Soviet Union itself.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_222.wav|Yet current technology has attained a level of sophistication where it's reasonable for us to begin this effort.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_094.wav|The United Nations designated the 1970s as the first disarmament decade, but good intentions were not enough.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_072.wav|Yes, I am not going to continue trying to respond to these repetitions of the falsehoods that have already been stated here.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_136.wav|It was an interesting moment.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_118.wav|Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_035.wav|And too many of them knew that this was their fate, but that was not the end.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_167.wav|And finally, some say the research will take a long time.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_055.wav|It'll build carefully, insteadly in the months and years ahead.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_152.wav|We know that peace follows in freedom's path and conflicts erupt when the will of the people is denied.

wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_199.wav|The fast few days when I've been at that window upstairs, I've thought a bit of the shining city upon a hill.

wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_036.wav|Through it all was their faith and a spirit that moved their faith.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_159.wav|Now I don't think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich and not the other way around it just doesn't work out that way.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_025.wav|Already pushing down tax rates has freed our economy to vault forward to record growth.

wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_002.wav|The power of the presidency is often thought to reside within this oval office.

wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_198.wav|My predecessors in the Oval Office have appeared before you on other occasions to describe the threat posed by Soviet power and to propose steps to address that threat.

wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_033.wav|We will get to the bottom of this, and I will take whatever action is called for.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_088.wav|It crosses national boundaries and enters into the hearts of men and women everywhere.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_069.wav|Our choice is not between a balanced budget and a tax cut.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_095.wav|No higher than 35 percent.

wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_022.wav|I remember one Christmas Eve during the Great Depression.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_106.wav|As I flew back this evening, I had many thoughts.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_002.wav|It's a great pleasure to be here at Moscow State University, and I want to thank you all for turning out.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_003.wav|I have witnessed a bloody futility of two world wars and Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_145.wav|And it must take its life from the eternal things, from the source of all life which is faith.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_143.wav|We had to move immediately to improve the basic readiness and staying power of our conventional forces so they could meet and therefore help deter a crisis.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_011.wav|Yet the tide of belligerence continues to rise.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_060.wav|Let us not forget that in America, people solve problems and no national crusade has ever succeeded without human investment.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_031.wav|You see, despite all of George Washington's warnings about the divisiveness of the partisan spirit, federalists and Republicans were constantly at each other in those days.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_005.wav|I hope to address you on this entire subject in the near future.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_091.wav|Mr. Mondale, your rebuttal please.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_069.wav|I have therefore directed that American assistance including supplies of basic food and stuff, they offered to aid the Austrians in providing for these refugees.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_052.wav|We will call upon the American people for support and upon every man and woman in this chamber.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_140.wav|Today, I have outlined the kinds of bold, equitable proposals which the world expects of us, but we cannot reduce arms unilaterally.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_085.wav|The Soviets are leaving Afghanistan.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_076.wav|But then to ensure the tax cut is permanent, we call for indexing the tax rates in 1985 which means adjusting them for inflation.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_186.wav|After a terrible civil war between North and South, we healed our wounds and found true unity as a nation.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_035.wav|The key is freedom, freedom of thought, freedom of information, freedom of communication.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_145.wav|It is also true that this has been a situation in our borders back through a number of administrations.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_135.wav|Yet even as these plans are made the Sandinista regime knows the tide is turning and the cause of Nicaraguan freedom is riding its crest.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_014.wav|It is not, however, the greatest single tax increase in history.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_172.wav|But as never forget that such a peace would be a terrible hoax if the world were known.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_002.wav|Dwight Eisenhower reminded us that peace was purchased only at the price of strength and John F. Kennedy spoke of the burden and glory that is freedom.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_105.wav|And now let me turn to three other matters vital to family values and the quality of family life.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_025.wav|Government is the problem.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_198.wav|What kind of a people do they think we are?
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_096.wav|Today the federal government has 59 major welfare programs and spends more than a hundred billion dollars a year on.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_053.wav|The most dramatic movement of all has taken place more than 90% of the people are now living in countries that are democratic or headed in that direction.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_019.wav|Who among us would trade America's future for that of any other country in the world?
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_079.wav|In the days ahead, I will propose removing the roadblocks that have slowed our economy and reduced productivity.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_091.wav|It would be only fitting for Berlin to serve as the site of United Nations meetings, or world conferences on human rights and arms control.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_048.wav|That this cruelty too will end and that peace and tranquility will return again.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_126.wav|And let us see how far we can go in achieving truly substantial reductions in our strategic arsenal.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_073.wav|The deficit problem is a clear and present danger to the basic health of our republic.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_154.wav|American power must be exercised morally, of course, but it must also be exercised and exercised effectively.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_078.wav|And at the same time, we summoned the national will to knock down protectionist walls of broad instead of erecting them at home.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_061.wav|These democratic and free market revolutions are really the same revolution.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_133.wav|We were just about swept away by the warmth.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_219.wav|We're realists.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_019.wav|We must act today in order to preserve tomorrow and let there be no misunderstanding.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_104.wav|The Soviets assert that a balance of intermediate-range nuclear forces already exists.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_048.wav|More and more nations are turning to freely elected democratic governments.
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_005.wav|Nancy and I have felt their presence many times in many ways and believe me for us they've made all the difference.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_063.wav|We cannot let that happen here.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_130.wav|The final fact is that the Soviet Union is acquiring what can only be considered an offensive military force.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_018.wav|I am sure that we will get it done and that we shall do it in harmony and goodwill.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_100.wav|One official said many of the people who were cheating the system were very confident that nothing was going to happen to them.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_024.wav|There are no constraints on the human mind, no walls around the human spirit, no barriers to our progress, except those we are ourselves erect.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_105.wav|Consistent with safety standards, we will continue removing restraints on the bus and railroad industries.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_173.wav|So too is the Congress as a collegial body.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_022.wav|Our inflation rate is now the lowest in a quarter of a century.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_035.wav|I believe that many of the things they have done are evil in any concept of morality that we have.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_015.wav|Social security, as some of us had warned for so long, faced disaster.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_182.wav|Our foreign policy is a policy of strength, fairness and balance.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_147.wav|What they've learned already indicates a great potential for savings by simply bringing government procedures up to ordinary modern business standards.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_146.wav|Task forces from the private sector are engaged in a study of the management structure of government.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_103.wav|We didn't go and pursue to some kind of illusory detente.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_214.wav|But we will end it.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_056.wav|But the momentum of the continuing Soviet military build-up threatens both the conventional and the nuclear balance.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_011.wav|To those listening in East Berlin, a special word.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_120.wav|Finally, our proposal will include new incentives for summer youth employment to help young people get a start in the job market.
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_038.wav|once the source of disunity and civil war is now a point of pride for all americans we must never go back
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_157.wav|Our faith in the American people is reflected in another major endeavor.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_034.wav|And that doesn't include the additional savings from the hundreds of burdensome regulations already canceled for facing cancellation.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_021.wav|A revolution of compassion that led to private sector initiatives and a 77% increase in charitable giving.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_046.wav|the departure of all foreign forces at the request of the Lebanese authorities has been widely endorsed by everyone.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_019.wav|They have done the nation, as well as me personally, a great service by submitting a report of such integrity and depth.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_023.wav|In international relations too there's only one description for what together we have achieved.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_054.wav|To Bob Pachwood, Dan Rostyn Kowski, Russell Long, John Duncan, and Majority Leader Bob Dole,
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_057.wav|We support diplomatic efforts, but these efforts can never succeed if the Sandinistas win their war against the Nicaraguan people.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_079.wav|The more effective our forces are, the less likely it is that we'll have to use them.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_079.wav|The United States did its part, creating the Marshall Plan to help rebuild our allies and our former enemies.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_051.wav|I've already begun correcting this.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_011.wav|This is a great tribute to America.
wavs/reagan_1994_018.wav|Your work is needed as much now as it was when you inaugurated your conferences.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_068.wav|And so we always remain open to more constructive relations with the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_065.wav|Let's be clear about where the deficit problem comes from.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_178.wav|They are also the values which in the recent past, some among us had begun to doubt and view with a cynical eye.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_102.wav|For everyone's sake, we must put an end to such waste and corruption.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_153.wav|Some will say our mission is to save free enterprise.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_001.wav|well, in the hospital, I had, as you can readily understand, a lot of time for reflection.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_192.wav|The issue before the world is still the same as the one that Jefferson faced so squarely and so memorably.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_071.wav|But I am not going to pick out one and in advance hypothetically say, oh yes, we would send troops there.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_147.wav|But a freeze now would make us less, not more secure and would raise, not reduce, the risks of war.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_050.wav|Somewhere here lies Anne Frank.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_010.wav|for the criminals who did this deed, no punishment is enough to remove the blot of their crime.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_162.wav|It's the most hopeful possibility of the nuclear age, but it's not very well understood.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_017.wav|You and I, as individuals, can by borrowing, live beyond our means, but for only a limited period of time.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_116.wav|The most recent has been the one in Brighton.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_090.wav|I have asked Vice President Bush to reconvene his task force on terrorism, to review our terrorist policy in light of the events that have occurred.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_042.wav|I think that in dealing with the Soviet Union, one has to be realistic.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_024.wav|I'm especially pleased to join with the speaker and the Senate Majority Leader in urging the Congress to enact this plan by Easter.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_080.wav|So to provide them incentives to rebuild our economy, to save, to invest in America's future, I will stand by my word.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_114.wav|It's the only path that will lead to a strong sustained recovery.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_077.wav|Help us preserve the health and dignity of all workers.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_111.wav|Young men are fighting for Britain.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_228.wav|A lender, as we know, was charging interest rate that recovers the depreciated value of the dollar's loan.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_101.wav|And the United States has no comparable missiles.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_061.wav|To assure and sustain recovery, we must continue getting runaway spending under control to bring those deficits down.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_101.wav|The Soviet attempts to impose the Eastmark, the blockade.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_004.wav|In the eyes of many in the world, this every four years ceremony we accept as normal is nothing less than a miracle.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_187.wav|We fought two world wars in my lifetime against Germany and one with Japan.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_041.wav|We cannot win that race if we're swamped in a sea of red ink.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_021.wav|If we had sought world domination, then who could have opposed us?
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_065.wav|Consider for just a moment the sights we've seen this year.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_058.wav|I do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we do nothing.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_003.wav|Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen,
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_037.wav|And I told Mr. Grameco, we don't like their system, they don't like ours.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_154.wav|They never saw Reagan's regiments, the American people.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_183.wav|Who Jimmy Dildo was?
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_005.wav|it's not enough for us to view this as some remote event in which we ourselves are not involved.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_098.wav|Over the past seven months, the United States has put forward a broad-based comprehensive series of proposals to reduce the risk of war.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_082.wav|In Cambodia, the first steps have been taken toward withdrawal of Vietnamese troops.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_090.wav|It is better to be here ready to protect the peace than to take blind shelter across the sea, rushing to respond only after freedom is lost.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_049.wav|Government can and must provide opportunity, not smother it, foster productivity, not stifle it.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_064.wav|But experience shows that simply setting deficit targets does not assure they'll be met.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_009.wav|In the New York area for example, four supervisors were scheduled to report for work and 17 additionally volunteered.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_066.wav|An American president with a Soviet counterpart strolling through Red Square and talking to pass-or-by about war and peace.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_069.wav|There are other Soviet weapon systems which also represent a major threat.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_008.wav|So I'd like to set the record straight on a few of the things that you might have heard lately.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_146.wav|This has happened, but it could not have happened if the West had not maintained, indeed strengthened its will, its commitment to world freedom.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_124.wav|With me abortion is not a problem of religion.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_062.wav|Your government will continue to act aggressively, but nothing would be more effective than for Americans simply to quit using illegal drugs.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_117.wav|The recovery program will provide jobs for most, but others will need special help and training for new skills.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_081.wav|Now, let me turn now to our hopes for arms control negotiations.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_171.wav|It is the universal right of all God's children.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_173.wav|And some things have changed.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_141.wav|The woman who has run to her car after shopping at night is a victim.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_003.wav|We pause together to mourn and honor the valor of our seven challenger heroes and I hope that we're now ready to do what they would want us to do.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_035.wav|Throughout the world, he said, change is the order of the day.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_089.wav|No ifs, ends, or buts.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_209.wav|If the Soviet Union will join with us in our effort to achieve major arms reduction, we will have succeeded in stabilizing the nuclear balance.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_046.wav|Their government still found the resources to transfer $75 billion in weapons to client states in the past five years.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_091.wav|In the Persian Gulf, the United States made clear its commitment to defend freedom of navigation and free world interest.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_138.wav|The Soviet Union itself is not immune to this reality.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_076.wav|Frank Karlochi, my new National Security Advisor, is respected for his experience in government and trusted for his judgment and counsel.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_032.wav|Today, there's a new epidemic.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_065.wav|With each sunrise, we are reminded that millions of our citizens have yet to share in the abundance of American prosperity.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_046.wav|There are threats now to our freedom, indeed to our very existence, that other generations could never even have imagined.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_057.wav|The federal budget is both a symptom and a cause of our economic problems.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_215.wav|We weren't just marking time.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_051.wav|Now, it's only been 10 months since the first phase of our program went into effect.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_167.wav|We see the dream coming true in the spirit of discovery of Richard Cavoli.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_138.wav|We must keep up our guard, but we must also continue to work together to lessen and eliminate tension and mistrust.

wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_140.wav|And we believe me supported the Simpson-Mazoli bill strongly and the bill that came out of the Senate.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_227.wav|We know it is.

wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_073.wav|It's the path for both sides to a safer future, a system that defends human life instead of threatening it.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_099.wav|And this is what we did.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_135.wav|Our defensive strategy means we need military forces that can move very quickly.

wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_095.wav|It's fitting to remember, here, the great loss is also suffered by the Russian people during World War II.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_070.wav|Well, I'll accept that.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_129.wav|If you will permit me to share these thoughts again with the young people who might be listening or watching this evening.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_057.wav|I do not believe in a fate that will fall on us no matter what we do.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_020.wav|Well, something very exciting has been happening here in Washington and you are responsible.

wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_198.wav|Two hundred years of American history should have taught us that nothing is impossible.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_022.wav|But in our lifetime, we've seen marginal tax rates skyrocket as high as 90% and not even the poor have been spared.

wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_137.wav|The focus is on the Sandinistas their promises and their actions.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_072.wav|One of those visuals you've seen in the last year is the signing of accords between Mr. Gorbachev and me and the destruction of American and Soviet missiles.

wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_014.wav|We coined the word stagflation to describe this.

wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_032.wav|The federalists of the Northeast had held power for a long time, and were not anxious to relinquish it.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_080.wav|The strength of our national defense must be restored so that we can pursue prosperity and peace and freedom while maintaining our commitment to the truly needy.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_223.wav|The plane door opened and Jeremiah Deppin came slowly down the ramp.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_115.wav|America will never be whole as long as the right to life granted by our creator is denied to the unborn.

wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_139.wav|Information in our defenses is available to our citizens, our elected officials, and the world.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_131.wav|They have continued to build far more intercontinental ballistic missiles than they could possibly need simply to deter an attack.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_004.wav|Let me say it's also a great pleasure to once again have this opportunity to speak directly to the people of the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_053.wav|How can they possibly justify using naked force to crush a people who ask for nothing more than the right to lead their own lives in freedom and dignity?
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_217.wav|We made the city freer, and we left her in good hands.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_148.wav|I've been asked if I have any regrets.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_130.wav|Sometimes it takes faith.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_009.wav|I understand that it is being seen and heard as well in the east.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_014.wav|I was very interested to hear about Central America and our process down there.

wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_082.wav|We can't rely on hope alone.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_005.wav|It's my duty to report to you tonight on the progress that we have made in our relations with other nations.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_125.wav|To believe that together with God's help we can and will resolve the problems which now confront us.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_033.wav|Our automobile industry is overhauled assembly lines, increased worker productivity, and is competitive once again.

wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_066.wav|We Americans make no secret of our belief in freedom.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_061.wav|We have every right to dream heroic dreams.

wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_012.wav|these past 40 years have not been an easy time for the west or for the world,
wavs/reagan_1994_024.wav|Freedom would not have come to Eastern Europe without the perseverance of many beleaguered freedom fighters.
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_021.wav|freedom prospers when religion is vibrant and the rule of law under god is acknowledged
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_134.wav|Well let's solve this problem with a single bull stroke.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_165.wav|We haven't built a new long-range bomber for 21 years.

wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_005.wav|We will be guided tonight by their acts and we will be guided forever by their words.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_157.wav|Think of it, we've only had one balanced budget in the last 20 years.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_078.wav|These actions are not directed against the Polish people.

wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_004.wav|That's a lot of reports, but there's no shortage of new things to say about the State of the Union.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_010.wav|Issues I want to touch on with you in a few moments.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_040.wav|Now, so far, I've been talking about only one part of our program for economic recovery, the budget cutting part.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_029.wav|Tonight then we're strong, prosperous, at peace and we are free.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_051.wav|Everywhere here are memories pulling us, touching us, making us understand that they can never be erased.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_082.wav|Not only of the superpowers actually begun to reduce their stockpiles of nuclear weapons and hope for even more progress is bright.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_050.wav|this must happen very soon.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_004.wav|Europe was enslaved and the world prayed for its rescue.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_006.wav|And we speak to you not simply as fellow citizens, but as fellow parents and grandparents and as concerned neighbors.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_038.wav|Drug abuse costs you and your federal Americans at least $60 billion a year.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_124.wav|Let me stress that for agreements to work, both sides must be able to verify compliance.

wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_085.wav|And they have been using these things to have government through court orders, inhibit the practice of religion.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_207.wav|We will also keep our freedom.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_157.wav|We say to you tonight, you are not alone freedom fighters, America will support you with moral and material assistance.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_016.wav|Now you may have heard that some special interest opposed this bill, and that's right.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_122.wav|To millions volunteering time, corporations adopting schools and communities putting together to help the neediest among us at home.

wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_021.wav|I supported because it's fair.

wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_041.wav|I don't minimize its importance.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_085.wav|Second, in the area of national security policy, I have ordered the NSC to begin a comprehensive review of all covert operations.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_237.wav|The present situation is no worse and in fact is not as bad as some of those they faced.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_159.wav|I have often looked at that picture behind the president without being able to tell whether it was a rising or setting son.

wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_033.wav|Whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor since you've asked it.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_139.wav|Our effort to restore fiscal integrity and common sense to the federal establishment isn't limited to the budget cuts and tax policy.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_107.wav|Nancy and I shared that remembrance two years ago at the Normandy American Cemetery in France.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_081.wav|Progress may be slow, measured in inches and feet, not miles, but we will progress.

wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_041.wav|And I think that perhaps we established a little better understanding.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_191.wav|As some nations are tempted to turn to protectionism, our strategy cannot be to follow them but to lead the way toward free or trade.

wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_178.wav|The President and Congress, to be sure, share many responsibilities, but their roles are not the same.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_095.wav|Once, earlier in this century, an evil influence threatened that the lights were going out all over the world.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_046.wav|Will we Americans yearn to let them go?
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_038.wav|Putting America back to work means putting all Americans back to work.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_127.wav|It doesn't slow down the pace of negotiations.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_071.wav|Behind all of this is a record of diplomatic movement and accomplishment.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_225.wav|We saw again the spirit of American heroism at its finest.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_008.wav|It is part of a careful long-term plan to make America strong again after too many years of neglect and mistakes.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_056.wav|But this, there's been no change in my attitude at all.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_025.wav|America has no territorial ambitions.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_117.wav|More than half of all American oil imports now pass through the Caribbean.

wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_146.wav|It's still play but cut the cards.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_059.wav|Already, throughout the free world, citizens have publicly demonstrated their support for the Polish people.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_110.wav|We will work hard to make these talks an opportunity for real progress in our quest for peace.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_008.wav|Others of you, I guess, were thinking, what's he doing, hiding out in the White House?
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_010.wav|For an America of compassion that opens its heart to those who cry out for help.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_086.wav|Hope, therefore, is a realistic attitude and despair and uninteresting little vice.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_038.wav|And we're not going to change their system and they sure better not try to change ours.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_156.wav|The 90s will prove no different, and this brings us to my third point.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_196.wav|The protection of our national security has required that we undertake a substantial program to enhance our military forces.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_192.wav|Well, the emergency is upon us.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_182.wav|Why the pilgrims came here?

wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_020.wav|The time has come to proceed toward a great new challenge, a second American revolution of hope and opportunity.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_036.wav|It's getting younger and stronger.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_011.wav|This powerful sense of energy has made American synonymous for opportunity the world over.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_034.wav|Our third objective tonight is global, continuing the exciting economic and democratic revolutions we've seen around the world.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_011.wav|They want to raise their families in peace without harming anyone or suffering harm themselves.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_013.wav|And please join me in warm congratulations to the Speaker of the House.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_218.wav|Americans ever since have emulated their deeds.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_057.wav|They insist that our triumph is yesterday's news, part of a past that holds no lessons for the future.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_063.wav|Unemployment will remain too high and we will leave an unconscionable burden of national debt for our children.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_071.wav|My people have sent me here today to speak for them as citizens of the world which they truly are.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_042.wav|We don't seek nuclear superiority.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_013.wav|The choice is up to the men and women you've elected to the Congress, and that means the choice is up to you.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_082.wav|We still have none.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_130.wav|The use of chemical and biological weapons has long been viewed with revulsion by civilized nations.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_144.wav|In the first six months of fiscal 1982 alone, they found $5.8 billion of savings and improved use of funds.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_007.wav|And on behalf of the American people, I want to salute you for your service to Congress and countries.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_175.wav|To this, this foremost, they must always be attended.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_068.wav|But states and localities, many of which enjoy surpluses from the recovery, must not permit their tax and regulatory policies to stand as barriers to growth.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_035.wav|Now, leadership.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_080.wav|I have no hesitancy in saying so.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_196.wav|Let us tell the world that a new age is not only possible, but probable.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_049.wav|It adheres to the failed policy of trying to balance the budget on the taxpayers' back.
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_062.wav|what no one church could do by itself
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_055.wav|That he tailed budget that we will submit.

wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_180.wav|Will not be bombs and rockets, but a test of wills and ideas.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_048.wav|Last month, I announced six initiatives which we believe will do just that.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_151.wav|If the Soviet government wants an agreement that truly reduces nuclear arms, there will be such an agreement.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_162.wav|This national feeling is good, but it won't come for much and it won't last unless it's grounded in thoughtfulness and knowledge.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_022.wav|I'm going to pick out something you said earlier.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_042.wav|Exclusions and exemptions cause similar incomes to be taxed at different levels.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_087.wav|Today, as 40 years ago, our armies are here for only one purpose to protect and defend democracy.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_037.wav|Few could or would afford the high interest rates for home mortgages, or installment buying of an automobile.

wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_152.wav|Now before the Congress, we need it to be passed.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_116.wav|The Congress opens its proceedings each day as does the Supreme Court with an acknowledgement of the Supreme being.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_129.wav|But life has a way of reminding you of big things through small incidents.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_068.wav|So, for example, if your friend or neighbor or a family member has a drug or alcohol problem, don't turn the other way.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_003.wav|But before I do, I wanted to share some thoughts, some of which I've been saving for a long time.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_224.wav|It is up to us to see they aren't without hope.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_013.wav|Millions in our inner cities who long for real jobs, safe neighborhoods and schools that truly teach.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_074.wav|But freedom doesn't begin or end with elections.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_036.wav|There will be another large deficit in this present year which ends September 30th.
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_042.wav|thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself

wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_008.wav|In the last 21 months, more than six million people have gotten jobs.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_077.wav|This time, however, we couldn't get the support we had last year.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_027.wav|This happened on my watch.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_001.wav|just a speaker, president, distinguished members of the house and senate.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_005.wav|I come with a heartfelt wishes of my people for peace, bearing honest proposals and looking for genuine progress.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_128.wav|He is also free prisoners whose names I've given him every time we've met.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_087.wav|And an American mediated accord will soon send 50,000 Cuban troops home from Angola.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_082.wav|And the continued high interest rates last year cost the government about $5 billion more than anticipated.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_015.wav|I want to thank you for your cooperation in helping to arrange this joint session of the Congress.

wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_113.wav|The leadership isn't taking this where we want to go.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_091.wav|And something else we learned.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_140.wav|A greater and greater burden on the peoples of the Soviet Union, on all the peoples of the world.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_083.wav|The Soviet Union, through its threats and pressures, deserves a major share of blame for the developments in Poland.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_066.wav|And as I mentioned, we agreed to continue meeting.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_044.wav|And when I became governor of California, I started this and I continued in this office.

wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_195.wav|So tomorrow night in the kitchen, I hope the talking begins.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_181.wav|But we must not be misled by those who would make defense once again the scapegoat of the federal budget.

wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_096.wav|Our standard here will be fairness.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_038.wav|And starting next year, the deficits will get smaller until in just a few years, the budget can be balanced.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_083.wav|We also have stood firm on retaining the tax cuts already in place because, as I said, they are essential to restoring the economy.

wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_099.wav|We will continue to do so.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_071.wav|Those rates should be lower now than they are with the success we've had in reducing inflation.

wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_046.wav|These will be followed by indexing of the tax brackets, so workers getting cost of living pay raises won't be moved up into higher brackets.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_032.wav|with this goal in mind, I have consulted with our French and Italian allies.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_044.wav|It's the promise that keeps our nation forever good, and generous, a model and hope to the world.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_087.wav|Contrary to some of the wild charges you may have heard, this administration has not and will not turn its back on America's elderly or America's poor.

wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_153.wav|It's why now more than ever we must not falter.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_033.wav|I mean schools that work, economic independence for the poor, restoring respect for family life and family values.

wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_122.wav|If we had done nothing, it would have risen to almost 25%.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_036.wav|Since the dawn of the atomic age we've sought to reduce the risk of war by maintaining a strong deterrent and by seeking genuine arms control.

wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_098.wav|We want a wipe from the face of the earth, the terrible weapons that man now has in his hands.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_068.wav|So I can say there are a great many interest.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_102.wav|On November 18th of last year, I announced United States objectives in arms control agreements.

wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_086.wav|Well, weeks and weeks of negotiations resulted in a congressional budget resolution combining revenue increases and further spending reductions.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_010.wav|The truth is we're proposing nothing of the kind.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_009.wav|Letter came from Peter Swini.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_022.wav|And so I think that the lines can meet actually in constant dollars in the domestic side of the budget.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_026.wav|As a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history took place in 1977.

wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_101.wav|We know that peace is not just the absence of war.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_083.wav|The Soviets rejected this plan.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_057.wav|I've recently returned from a summit meeting with world leaders in Ottawa, Canada and the message I heard from them was quite clear.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_052.wav|But this agreement must be adhered to without slipping into the errors of the past.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_014.wav|suffice it to say that the united states cannot afford illusions about the nature of the USSR,
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_014.wav|And in so doing, they tapped a spring of hope and creativity that was to completely transform history.

wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_025.wav|We start by considering what must be done to maintain peace and review all the possible threats against our security.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_171.wav|The American people believe forging real and lasting peace to be their sacred trust.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_027.wav|Our commitment to self-determination, freedom and peace is the very soul of America.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_054.wav|Well, back in 1980, when I was running for president, it was all so different.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_173.wav|This administration is committed to keeping America the technological leader of the world now and into the 21st century.

wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_021.wav|And the image that comes to mind like a refrain is an article one.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_071.wav|For the best way to reduce deficits is through economic growth.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_003.wav|It's true that the social security system has financial problems.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_031.wav|Well, they weren't.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_123.wav|We have re-found our values.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_052.wav|The fact is bureaucracies are a problem around the world.

wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_038.wav|Let us move together with an historic reform of tax simplification for fairness and growth.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_102.wav|But we were succeeding to the point that the Lebanese government had been organized.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_101.wav|Well, for people who smoke a pack a day, that tax will mean an increase of only $2.40 a month.

wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_076.wav|Can we solve the problems confronting us?
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_043.wav|It was back in 1981 and I was attending my first big economic summit, which was held that year in Canada.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_069.wav|And it took 300 people, my office of management and budget, just to read the bill so the government wouldn't shut down.

wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_198.wav|And I found myself wondering what it would be like for someone wondering if someone a hundred years from now would be driving down that highway and if they would see the same thing.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_061.wav|First of all, it should be looked at as an integral part of the entire package.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_069.wav|Even with our tax cuts, taxes as a fraction of gross national product remained about the same as they were in 1970.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_187.wav|Nothing is impossible.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_024.wav|A complete turnabout, a revolution seven years ago, America was weak and freedom everywhere, was under siege.

wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_154.wav|And this was why the provisions that we had in with regard to sanctions and so forth.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_168.wav|We must build a new world, a far better world.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_078.wav|Go into any school room.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_075.wav|I'm genuinely honored that he's given up his own presidential aspirations to serve the country as my Chief of Staff.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_099.wav|And then one day, those silent, suffering people were offered a chance to vote, to choose the kind of government they wanted.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_046.wav|They are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_084.wav|So I have also sent a letter to President Brezhnev urging him to permit the restoration of basic human rights in Poland, provided for in the Helsinki Final Act.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_174.wav|The Air Force is modernizing.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_029.wav|The United States has fought four wars in my lifetime.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_112.wav|I think there's a great difference between the government of Iran threatening our diplomatic personnel.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_069.wav|They called it the Reagan Revolution.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_135.wav|A time of browsing wonder in heroic achievement as they said in the film back to the future, where we're going, we don't need roads.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_069.wav|And 1988 is one of those years.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_067.wav|There are too many imponderables for anyone to predict deficits or surplus as several years ahead with any degree of accuracy.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_060.wav|Americans should know the people of the Soviet Union, their hopes and fears and the facts of their lives.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_144.wav|We foresee a flowering of economic growth and individual liberty in a world at peace.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_019.wav|The so-called alternate budget backed by liberals in the House of Representatives were the lower the figure to 2 to 3%.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_163.wav|We plan to consult with leaders of other nations as well.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_122.wav|One of the greatest contributions the United States can make to the world is to promote freedom as the key to economic growth.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_015.wav|Once wrote in his diary, many thinking people believe America has seen its best days.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_049.wav|Now is the time for choosing.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_011.wav|The budget request that is now before the Congress has been trimmed to the limits of safety.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_150.wav|As I said before, this is the first Soviet leader, not to make world revolution a priority.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_066.wav|Many languish in neighborhood riddled with drugs and bereft of hope.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_076.wav|Concoring the deficits and putting the government's house in order will require the best efforts of all of us.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_082.wav|This is after all the 11th summit of the post-war era, and still the differences endure.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_100.wav|We never initiated any kind of action.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_083.wav|The great sadness of this loss echoes down to our own time and the streets of Warsaw, Prague and East Berlin.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_014.wav|They wished to serve and they did.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_034.wav|It was a mistake.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_190.wav|She came around immediately and said here, and there, now put it back.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_100.wav|I never meant to go into politics.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_109.wav|I have a great deal that I want to accomplish with you and for you over the next two years.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_049.wav|There was a time when we depended on coastal forts and artillery batteries because with the weaponry of that day any attack would have had to come by sea.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_037.wav|I asked so many questions about the hostages' welfare that I didn't ask enough about the specifics of the total Iran plan.
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_022.wav|when our founding fathers passed the first amendment
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_078.wav|Agreements genuinely reinforce peace only when they are kept.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_012.wav|Those two lines will meet and when they meet, that is a balanced budget.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_139.wav|My administration, our country, and I are committed to achieving arms reductions agreements based on these principles.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_127.wav|36 for pollution control.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_057.wav|Meet our commitment to ensure a strong national defense.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_053.wav|No NATO weapons, conventional or nuclear will ever be used in Europe except in response to attack.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_101.wav|Cuban backed guerrillas who want power for themselves and their backers, not democracy for the people.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_114.wav|The second proposal that I've made to President Brezhnev concerns strategic weapons.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_175.wav|And as for those who create the popular culture, well-grounded patriotism is no longer the style.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_176.wav|Some time ago Mr. Mondale said something about education and college students and helped with that kind.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_089.wav|We look to the day when West Berlin can become one of the chief aviation hubs in all central Europe.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_011.wav|But first, I want to take a little time to talk to you, much as I would to any group of university students in the United States.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_030.wav|That message was very simple.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_046.wav|For the first time in 14 years, the federal government spent less in real terms last year than the year before.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_097.wav|What is all this money done?
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_004.wav|I know that CIA is already going forward with one.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_097.wav|The revolution out of which our liberty was conceived signaled an historical call to an entire world seeking hope.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_224.wav|He caught sight of our flag, saluted it, said God bless America in the midst of a terrible tragedy on the Potomac.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_083.wav|I too want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_005.wav|Our tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_014.wav|Israel must have learned that there is no way it can impose its own solutions on hatreds as deep and bitter as those that produce this tragedy.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_006.wav|Perhaps the composer Paul Linky understood something about American presidents.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_127.wav|President Gorbachev has brought about some internal democratic reforms and begun the withdrawal from Afghanistan.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_154.wav|Free your markets, sound currencies around the world.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_061.wav|recent events have produced new problems, and we must again assume our responsibility.
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_055.wav|he increased strength but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_146.wav|And I supported this bill.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_150.wav|The deficit is one.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_022.wav|It is for this reason that I must tell those who failed a report for duty this morning.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_009.wav|Well, the reason I haven't spoken to you before now is this.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_059.wav|Historians looking back at our time will note the consistent restraint and peaceful intentions of the west.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_161.wav|He didn't live to see that goal achieved.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_212.wav|And she's still a beacon, still a magnet for all who must have freedom, for all the pilgrims from all the lost places who are hurtling through the darkness toward home.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_185.wav|The great civilized ideas, individual liberty, representative government, and the rule of law under God.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_194.wav|We have developed a realistic military strategy to deter threats to peace and to protect freedom if deterrence fails.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_045.wav|Some of you were hardly more than boys with the deepest joys of life before you, yet you risked everything here.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_128.wav|No democracy is not a fragile flower.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_132.wav|But the call of the future is too strong.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_115.wav|Let us follow that path together.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_108.wav|In Western Cuba we see this military airfield and its complement of modern Soviet built MiG-23 aircraft.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_042.wav|The willingness to see the future based on the experience of the past.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_055.wav|We share the glistening hope that rests in every human soul.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_133.wav|And tonight I ask you in the Congress to move this year on legislation to protect.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_032.wav|Second, let's check our progress in attacking social problems where important gains have been made but which still need critical attention.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_121.wav|We must offer both short-term help and long-term hope for our unemployed.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_074.wav|We need a plan to overcome this danger, a plan based on these principles.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_025.wav|It was a world where aggressive Soviet communism was on the rise, an America strength was in decline.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_198.wav|And that's about all I have to say tonight, except for one thing.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_024.wav|He had known personal tragedy, he knew how disorderly a place the world could be.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_073.wav|We must meet it.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_120.wav|On the flyleaf, under the heading My Pledge, he had written these words,
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_045.wav|It is time to check and reverse the growth of government which shows signs of having grown beyond the consent of the governed.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_106.wav|Competitiveness also means giving our farmers a shot at participating fairly and fully in a changing world market.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_077.wav|My dream is that you will travel the road ahead with liberty's lamp guiding your steps and opportunities arm, steadying your way.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_074.wav|We stand ready to take the next steps down the road of cooperation through verifiable arms reduction.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_067.wav|Must civilization perish in a hail of fiery atoms?
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_017.wav|In the center of Warsaw there is a sign that notes the distances to two capitals.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_215.wav|Indeed, we must.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_004.wav|It's been humbling and inspiring for Nancy and me to be spending our first Christmas in this place.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_163.wav|Thank you.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_038.wav|There has been much change in the last eight years in our foreign relations.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_054.wav|High taxes and excess spending growth created our present economic mess.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_068.wav|the whole world will be a safer place when this region which is known so much trouble can begin to no peace instead.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_023.wav|Now you'll recall that when our administration came into office a year ago last January, we announced a plan for economic recovery.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_232.wav|Don't let anyone tell you that America's best days are behind her, that the American spirit has been vanquished.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_024.wav|Six months is long enough.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_048.wav|No one pretends that the way ahead will be easy.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_063.wav|Graham Rudman Hollings can mark a dramatic improvement.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_016.wav|He wrote that July 26, 1775.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_095.wav|I've made it clear to Mr. Gorbachev that we must reduce the mistrust and suspicions between us if we are to do such things as reduce arms.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_105.wav|And there's one more thing.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_059.wav|I elaborated on my proposals for real people to people contacts on a wide scale.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_225.wav|And as we proceed, we must remain constant in preserving the nuclear deterrent and maintaining a solid capability for flexible response.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_151.wav|The time has also come for major reform of our criminal justice statutes and acceleration of the drive against organized crime and drug trafficking.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_176.wav|At Ottawa and Concoune, I met with leaders of the major industrial powers and developing nations.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_002.wav|In a moment, I'll be sitting at that desk, taking up a pen and signing the most sweeping overhaul of tax code in our nation's history.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_001.wav|Douglass McCartner made an unforgettable farewell to the country he loved and served so well.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_030.wav|A small moment with a big meeting, a moment the sailor who wrote it in the letter couldn't get out of his mind.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_162.wav|After all, we've done so far, let no one say that this nation cannot reach the destiny of our dreams.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_017.wav|But as I said, we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_040.wav|In 1981, there were 23,000 fewer pages in the federal register which lists new regulations.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_168.wav|All his life he's been enthralled by the mysteries of medicine.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_007.wav|From behind all the numbers lies America's ability to prevent the greatest of human tragedies and preserve our free way of life in a sometimes dangerous world.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_139.wav|The fall will probably kill you.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_072.wav|A gigantic tax increase has been built into the system.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_197.wav|Now, thus far tonight, I've shared with you my thoughts on the problems of national security we must face together.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_119.wav|The great culture of your diverse land speaks with a glowing passion to all humanity.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_194.wav|Support for freedom fighters is self-defense and totally consistent with the OAS and UN charters.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_081.wav|Growth of our major health care programs, Medicare and Medicaid will be slow, but protections for the elderly and needy will be preserved.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_068.wav|Well, I appreciate the gentleman's support and suggest his questions and message your own representative should hear.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_071.wav|When President Kennedy spoke at the city hall those 24 years ago, freedom was encircled.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_101.wav|We did 25% across the board that barely held even with, if it did that much, with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_010.wav|The sweet part is California and the ranch and freedom.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_107.wav|It doesn't tell us.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_129.wav|So why should we believe that they had placed that much real more reliance on land based.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_061.wav|Personal savings, which trended downwards throughout the last decade, are increasing.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_015.wav|we cannot assume that their ideology and purpose will change, this implies enduring competition,
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_071.wav|With a common sense that the people have already shown, I'm sure we all know what the answer to that question would be.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_064.wav|The same thing has happened in other areas.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_088.wav|Israel could not be blamed for that.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_205.wav|That's why we've moved to reconstruct our national defenses.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_014.wav|Mr. Speaker and Senator Baker,
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_028.wav|The United States is the economic miracle, the model to which the world once again turns.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_057.wav|A UN General Assembly Special Session on Africa has called for more market-oriented structural reform in that region.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_080.wav|In 30 days I will send back to you those items as decisions which if I had the authority to line them out I would do so.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_188.wav|We export over 20 percent of our industrial production and 40 percent of our farmland produces for export.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_086.wav|Act worthy of yourselves.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_108.wav|Now, you could say that this is an insurance policy for the future, a remedy that will be at hand if needed, but only resorted to if absolutely necessary.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_051.wav|We can't afford to believe that we will never be threatened.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_114.wav|But back in the 1960s when I began, it seemed to me that we'd begun reversing the order of things.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_125.wav|It's a problem of the Constitution.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_016.wav|Unemployment was reaching in tolerable levels and all because government was too big and spent too much of our money.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_055.wav|Had we been better prepared, peace might have been preserved.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_072.wav|In the end, the people vote.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_030.wav|A new kind of defeatism was heard.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_071.wav|And of course, many of you have been cured through treatment and self-help.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_006.wav|And I think the familiarity of that term is justified.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_035.wav|For 19 out of the last 20 years, the federal government has spent more than it took in.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_224.wav|There will be failures and setbacks, just as there will be successes and breakthroughs.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_092.wav|I am as you are impatient for results, but goodwill and good hopes do not always yield lasting results.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_244.wav|I fell to Americans, tonight we're launching an effort which holds the promise of changing the course of human history.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_132.wav|We can fill the cradles of those who want a child to love.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_139.wav|When I took office in January 1981 I was appalled by what I found.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_207.wav|Born 79 years ago, she lives in the inner city where she cares for infants, born of mothers who are heroin addicts.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_151.wav|This legislation will permit states and localities to apply to the federal government for designation as urban enterprise zones.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_172.wav|But we must develop the skills and industries that will make us a pioneer of tomorrow.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_048.wav|I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_054.wav|But a second American revolution must carry the promise of opportunity for all.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_095.wav|All of the were occasional snipings and sometimes some artillery fire.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_128.wav|It moves them forward.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_109.wav|We'll push on to new possibilities not only on Earth, but in the next frontier of space.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_134.wav|Well, the difference is so small that it almost escapes you, but it's so great it tells you the whole story in just three words.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_055.wav|The allies remain strong, united and resolute.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_180.wav|It needs production.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_070.wav|That is where I think the future of the world lies.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_066.wav|We built two new types of submarine missiles and actually withdrew 10 submarines from strategic missions.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_098.wav|Well too often it is only made poverty harder to escape federal welfare programs have created a massive social problem with the best of intentions.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_241.wav|This could pave the way for arms control measures to eliminate the weapons themselves.
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_061.wav|we can do it doing together
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_074.wav|Since then the Soviets have strengthened their lead by the end of 1979 when Soviet leader Brezhnev declared a balance now exists.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_041.wav|Yet the tax system remains unfair and limits our potential for growth.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_185.wav|By contrast, in 1955, defense took up more than half of the federal budget.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_074.wav|Together with the government of Japan, concluded a Pacific Air Safety Agreement with the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_003.wav|Me here tonight in this historic chamber to continue that work.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_100.wav|In my lifetime, America set the standard for the world.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_148.wav|The commission is an important part of the ongoing struggle for justice in America and we strongly support its reauthorization.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_030.wav|In each, we struggled to defend freedom and democracy.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_087.wav|Specifically, I have proposed a four-point agenda to achieve this objective in my letter to President Brezhnev.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_192.wav|Doers you to tell your senators and congressmen that you know we must continue to restore our military strength?
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_110.wav|He led America out of revolutionary victory into infant nationhood.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_094.wav|Think for a moment how special it is to be an American.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_013.wav|Try to think of being young and never having a day without searing emotional and physical pain, desolate, unreleaved pain.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_002.wav|When we first met here seven years ago, many of us for the first time, it was with the hope of beginning something new for America.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_097.wav|It is the right to stick to dream, to follow your dream or stick to your conscience even if you're the only one in a sea of doubters.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_018.wav|First, a decade of rampant inflation drained its reserves as we tried to protect beneficiaries from the spiraling cost of living.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_062.wav|Social security was due to go bankrupt before 1983.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_029.wav|I went to those areas.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_111.wav|In a word, I would submit that what keeps you in Berlin is love.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_086.wav|But as I've said before, the most powerful force we can enlist against the federal deficit is an ever-expanding American economy unfettered and free.

wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_061.wav|But what has the Soviet Union done in these intervening years?
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_150.wav|We must recognize that progress in the pursuit of liberty is a necessary complement to military security.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_073.wav|We've agreed to establish a new Soviet consulate in New York and a new American consulate in Kiev.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_194.wav|Let us go to our strength.

wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_093.wav|Second, I will ask the Congress to adopt specific measures to control the growth of the so-called uncontrollable spending programs.

wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_052.wav|We simply are going to provide a deterrent so that it would be too costly for them if they are nursing any ideas of aggression against us.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_142.wav|How much and how fast it will change we do not know.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_187.wav|All of us know the terribly importance of maintaining the progress we've made in the decade of the 80s.

wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_118.wav|We see signs of renewal in increased attendance in places of worship, renewed optimism and faith in our future.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_064.wav|We will continue to support the job training partnership act, which has a nearly two-thirds job placement rate.

wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_121.wav|It remains remembering no treaty is better than a bad treaty.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_045.wav|Even today, though nearly one in three Soviet families is without running hot water, and the average family spends two hours a day shopping for the basic necessities of life.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_156.wav|Well, action is still needed.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_069.wav|The exhibits that will be included in this exchange are one of the most effective ways for the average Soviet citizen to learn about our way of life.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_013.wav|They shot rope ladders over the face of these cliffs and began to pull themselves up.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_120.wav|It means keeping our military strong.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_042.wav|But I also believe something else about that.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_119.wav|The United States has been preparing carefully for resumption of strategic arms negotiations because we don't want a repetition of past disappointments.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_020.wav|We had harnessed the atom and had the ability to unleash its destructive poverse anywhere in the world.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_064.wav|That we must not do.

wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_074.wav|SDI will go forward.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_108.wav|Every decision it does not make for us will make our economy stronger, our lives more abundant, our future more free.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_156.wav|It may not be easy, but it's the best way, the only way to reel and lasting prosperity for all our people.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_130.wav|A second reflection I have on all this concerns some recent speculation that what is happening in the Soviet Union was in its way inevitable.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_055.wav|If we're to provide incentives and make capital available for the increased productivity required to provide real permanent jobs for our people.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_004.wav|If anyone expects just a proud recitation of the accomplishments of my administration, I say let's leave that to history.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_208.wav|But let me just say I'm totally committed to this course.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_167.wav|And that that suffering country may find self-determination, unity and peace at long last.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_174.wav|America's leadership in the world came to us because of our own strength and because of the values which guide us as a society.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_200.wav|That's why we've laid such stress not only on our own defense, but on our vital foreign assistance program.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_016.wav|Is life better for the people of Cuba because the Cuban military dictate who shall govern the people of Angola?
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_075.wav|Our economic program brought about the longest peacetime expansion in our history.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_041.wav|America is respected again in the world and looked to for leadership.

wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_038.wav|But an equally crucial test involves the House of Representatives.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_191.wav|And I hope that you in the Congress will understand the dollar for dollar security assistance contributes as much to global security as our own defense budget.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_028.wav|And what happened today does nothing to diminish it.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_112.wav|The path I've outlined is fair, balanced, and realistic.

wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_159.wav|You helped us start this economic recovery program last year.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_026.wav|And in 1947, Secretary of State, as you've been told, George Marshall announced the creation of what would become known as the Marshall Plan.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_123.wav|The main reason for this is the overpowering growth of federal grants in eight programs during the past few decades.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_113.wav|If there had been firmer support for that principle some 45 years ago, perhaps our generation wouldn't have suffered the bloodletting of World War II.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_004.wav|And today I myself make my second visit to speak in this place of freedom.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_058.wav|Unless we reduce the dangerous growth rate in government spending, we could face the progress or prospect of sluggish economic growth into the indefinite future.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_061.wav|What they called dangerous was just desperately needed.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_082.wav|Second, we must not relax our efforts to restore military strength just as we near our goal of a fully equipped trained and ready professional core.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_078.wav|There was first a great reconciliation among those who had been enemies, all of whom it suffered so greatly.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_112.wav|I will not fail thee nor forsake thee.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_123.wav|In the communist world as well, man's instinctive desire for freedom and self-determination surfaces again and again.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_163.wav|The volunteer spirit is still alive and well in America for all our citizens.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_015.wav|I'm often accused of being an optimist, and it's true I had to hunt pretty hard to find any good news in the Board's report.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_011.wav|Now those that details as we have them.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_129.wav|Others have accepted specific provisions with regard to taxes or spending cuts, which they opposed.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_010.wav|Since then, the amount of those increases we first proposed has been reduced by half through improvements in management and procurement and other savings.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_005.wav|Your trust is what gives the president his powers of leadership and his personal strength, and it's what I want to talk to you about this evening.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_163.wav|Just a few years ago, few would have imagined the progress our two nations have made together.
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_013.wav|The American experiment in democracy rests on this insight.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_050.wav|Two years later, another economic summit with pretty much the same cast.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_028.wav|When I was growing up, we failed to see how a new thing called radio would transform our marketplace.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_107.wav|Every dollar the federal government does not take from us.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_200.wav|This approach to stability through offensive threat has worked.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_024.wav|Those loud voices that are occasionally heard charging that the government is trying to solve a security problem by throwing money at it are nothing more than noise based on ignorance.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_032.wav|Even as we meet the rest of the world is astounded by the pundits and finger pointers who are so down on us as a nation.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_201.wav|We dare not make that mistake again.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_028.wav|I speak of the startling hope of giving our children a future free of both totalitarianism and nuclear terror.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_216.wav|After careful consultation with my advisors, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I believe there is a way.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_046.wav|Now this is not to say that the Soviet Union is planning to make war on us.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_148.wav|They also mean little to the individual whose state has stripped him of human freedom and dignity.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_152.wav|It's high time that we make our cities safe again.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_092.wav|Drug abuse is a repudiation of everything America is.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_230.wav|America does possess now the technologies to attain very significant improvements in the effectiveness of our conventional non-nuclear forces.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_044.wav|Our government has no power except that granted it by the people.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_083.wav|So far it seems that the Soviet definition of parity is a box score of 1,300 to nothing in their favor.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_145.wav|I know that all of you want peace and so do I.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_094.wav|How can we help?
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_099.wav|In the food stamp program in the home last year, we identified almost 1.1 billion in overpayments.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_045.wav|As I told the Tower Board, I didn't know about any diversion of funds to the Contras, but as President, I cannot escape responsibility.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_066.wav|That was 1186 pages long weighing 15 pounds.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_114.wav|And it is substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary spring of popular government.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_076.wav|Throughout the Pacific, free markets are working miracle after miracle of economic growth.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_015.wav|They're killing our children.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_070.wav|Now the only answer to these systems is a comparable threat to Soviet threats.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_045.wav|We have had a federal, a balanced budget only eight times in the last 57 years.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_018.wav|We honor the giants of our history not by going back, but forward to the dreams their vision foresaw.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_088.wav|Well, 30 years ago, when he
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_131.wav|That's a little street just off Moscow's main shopping area.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_008.wav|You have no reason to be frightened.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_069.wav|But more responsible Soviet conduct around the world is a key element of the US Soviet agenda.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_052.wav|But our confidence must also be tempered by realism and patience.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_037.wav|But this Christmas brings little joy to the courageous Polish people.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_140.wav|On Wednesday my request to sustain the freedom fighters will be submitted which reflects our mutual desire for peace freedom and democracy in Nicaragua.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_172.wav|He also directs the choirs of three churches and is performed at the Kennedy Center.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_092.wav|When we look at attack submarines the United States has produced 27 while the Soviet Union has produced 61.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_124.wav|The data of the 1970s was based not on actions but promises.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_013.wav|I'm afraid my message that night was grim and disturbing.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_049.wav|The early evidence of that recovery has started coming in.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_076.wav|Those of you in union halls and workplaces everywhere, please make this challenge a part of your job every day.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_023.wav|You've been all over the country repeating something that I will admit the press has also been repeating that I believe that nuclear missiles could be fired and then called back.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_011.wav|That is what of the youngsters who died at this dark stall.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_190.wav|Meanwhile, we're working for reduction of arms and military activities, as I announced in my address to the nation last November 18th.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_070.wav|But about liberty.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_092.wav|We've come this far.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_026.wav|The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future and we'll continue to follow them.
wavs/reagan_1994_005.wav|At that time, Soviet armies were on the march in Poland and Afghanistan.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_014.wav|Then as now, the Speakership had changed hands and another great son of Texas, Sam Rayburn.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_014.wav|Indeed, as president of my own union, I led the first strike ever called by that union.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_067.wav|The Soviet Union built over 200 new backfire bombers and their brand new Blackjack bomber is now under development.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_039.wav|They knew what awaited them there, but they would not be deterred.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_212.wav|At the same time, let me emphasize that allied steadfastness remains a key to achieving arms reductions.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_133.wav|I'm still dedicated to reducing the level of spending until it's within our income.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_025.wav|I never said any such thing in a discussion of our strategic arms negotiations.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_049.wav|And I, in all due to the dress last year, I warned that the ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_204.wav|I've spoken of the shining city all my political life, but I don't know if I ever quite communicated what I saw when I said it.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_162.wav|I invite all nations to join with America today in the quest for such a world.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_110.wav|Let us show them by our actions that we understand what they died for.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_133.wav|In Nicaragua the struggle has extra meaning because that nation is so near our own borders.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_179.wav|For the ultimate determined in the struggle is not going that's now going on in the world.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_059.wav|The Soviets steadily increased the number of men under arms. They now number more than double those of the United States.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_057.wav|And I've been trying to figure out where the angel kissed you so that you should sit there for so long and do nothing.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_040.wav|And you let those people go with the guidelines of overall policy, not looking over their shoulder and nitpicking the manner in which they go at the job.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_020.wav|The marker says that the distances from Warsaw to Moscow and Warsaw to Brussels are equal.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_108.wav|Serious problems, fundamental differences remain.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_013.wav|I respect the right of workers in the private sector to strike.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_074.wav|Higher taxes would not mean lower deficits.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_128.wav|There were medical authorities.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_097.wav|With a space shuttle, we tested our ingenuity once again, moving beyond the accomplishments of the past into the promise and uncertainty of the future.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_091.wav|Next month, I will place two additional reforms before the Congress.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_026.wav|Then a strategy for strengthening peace and defending against those threats must be agreed upon.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_061.wav|I know that doesn't give you much time, but a great deal is at stake.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_103.wav|In just one set of grant programs, we have reduced 905 pages of regulations to 31.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_147.wav|It's been clear to me, steps should be taken to improve mutual communication, confidence, and lessen the likelihood of misinterpretation.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_020.wav|We are going to begin to act, beginning today.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_052.wav|In Central America too, the cause of freedom is being tested, and our resolve is being tested there as well.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_065.wav|My generation will remember how America swung into action when we were attacked in World War II.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_020.wav|And who could possibly have so little faith in our American people that they would trade our tomorrow for our yesterday?
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_047.wav|i think i should point out
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_027.wav|And we've done much these past years to restore our defenses, our alliances, and our leadership in the world.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_092.wav|I am directing Mr. Carlucci to take the necessary steps to make that happen.

wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_046.wav|Nancy's personal crusade, like that of so many other wonderful individuals, should become our national crusade.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_053.wav|Only if the Congress passes all of its major components does it have any real chance of success.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_105.wav|The Congress will soon receive my comprehensive proposals to enhance our competitiveness, including new science and technology centers.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_043.wav|Yes, we Americans like the future and like making the most of it.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_045.wav|Some people, even in my own country, look at the riot of experiment that is the free market and see only waste.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_053.wav|Quick fixes and artificial stimulants repeatedly applied over decades are what brought us the inflationary disorders that we've now paid such a heavy price to cure.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_040.wav|We have cut tax rates by almost 25%.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_008.wav|Governors of states were called excellency.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_049.wav|Yes, it's what they learned from failing, like an athlete in competition or a scholar in pursuit of the truth.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_006.wav|the past two days,
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_021.wav|In short, we could have achieved world domination, but that was contrary to the character of our people.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_013.wav|We must not only condemn aggression, we must enforce the dictates of our charter and resume the struggle for peace.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_040.wav|He is a trustworthy and level-headed leader who is respected around the world.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_060.wav|Let me make a few points that I feel have been overlooked.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_002.wav|Today is a day for morning and remembering.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_083.wav|But the regional conflicts that rack the globe are also beginning to cease.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_071.wav|These are the things that impelled him.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_048.wav|It regrettably cuts over $14 billion in essential defense spending, funding required to restore America's national security.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_177.wav|We've got to do a better job of getting across that America is freedom.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_086.wav|The United States proposes the mutual reduction of conventional, intermediate range nuclear and strategic forces.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_110.wav|And the Lord willing, that's exactly what I intend to do.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_113.wav|Why is it that we can build a nation with our prayers, but we can't use a school room for voluntary prayer, but must go next to the workplace.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_048.wav|To justify their fate, we must deliver the other part of our program.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_056.wav|Communist Nicaragua is the odd man out, suppressing the church, the press, and democratic dissent, and promoting subversion in the region.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_029.wav|I was struck by a sawdust sign on a burnt-out gutted structure that was being rebuilt.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_033.wav|It was said we could never work together.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_007.wav|GK Chesterden once said that the world would never starve for wonders, but only for the want of wonder.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_110.wav|Almost all the world's constitutions are documents in which governments tell the people what their privileges are.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_021.wav|Mortgage interest rates have averaged almost 15 percent for these six months, preventing families across America from buying homes.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_028.wav|And that they were all so weapons that or carriers that if they were sent out and there was a change, you could call them back before they had launched their missiles.

wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_082.wav|Some liberated countries were lost.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_010.wav|The United Nations is dedicated to world peace, and its charter clearly prohibits the international use of force.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_089.wav|Well, that's not acceptable anymore.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_026.wav|These are a measure of our commitment and emerging signs that we can defeat this enemy.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_046.wav|The committee measure quite simply falls far too short of the essential actions that we must take.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_139.wav|And it wasn't me that turned it down the Soviet Union dis about it.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_188.wav|No victory is beyond our reach.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_081.wav|Since the end of World War II, the United States has been the leader in serious disarmament and arms control proposals.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_113.wav|As Carl Sandberg said, all we need to begin with is a dream that we can do better than before.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_125.wav|Only such progress can fulfill the hopes of our own people and the rest of the world.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_079.wav|It must not be one dime higher than fiscal year 1985, and three points are key.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_053.wav|Here especially, the world is watching to see how this nation responds.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_155.wav|Of course, it also has promoted the use of violence and subversion by these same forces.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_100.wav|You've done so in spite of threats.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_039.wav|It wasn't easy.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_064.wav|The doubters would have us turned back the clock with tax increases that would offset the personal tax rate reductions already passed by this Congress.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_082.wav|But we will insist on trade that is fair and free.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_135.wav|I proposed and I think something that had never been proposed by any previous administration.
wavs/reagan_1994_002.wav|Each year after my election in 1980, we hosted Young America's foundation at the White House.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_042.wav|Something that happened to me a few years ago reflects some of this.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_084.wav|Few of us can give youngsters something as special and strong to look up to as you.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_007.wav|We've never had a tragedy like this.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_005.wav|We're not finished yet.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_083.wav|Indeed, he was on that side virtually throughout all his years in the Senate.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_007.wav|Here the rights of free people and the processes of representation have been debated and refined.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_122.wav|I wish I could show you more without compromising our most sensitive intelligence sources and methods.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_026.wav|Already, interest rates are down to 15 and 3.25%, but they must still go lower.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_209.wav|And how stands the city on this winter night?
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_138.wav|And none of us wants that.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_138.wav|So yes, this nation remains fully committed to America's space program.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_047.wav|It must include a combination of government and private efforts which complement one another.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_037.wav|Some young people question why we need weapons, particularly nuclear weapons, to deter war and to assure peaceful development.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_008.wav|Do not overdo it.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_015.wav|Prices were continuing to spiral upward.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_213.wav|We have met young America.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_160.wav|Well, I believe there's a better way of eliminating the threat of nuclear war.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_119.wav|Quote, this wall will fall, beliefs become reality.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_094.wav|Just as we must avoid illusions on our side, so we must dispel them on the Soviet side.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_102.wav|We must never again permit wild currency swings to cripple our farmers and other exporters.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_177.wav|In doing that, the President is accountable, accountable to the people in the most direct way, accountable to history, and to his own conscience.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_071.wav|Well, I was raised to have a faith and a belief and have been a member of the church since I was a small boy.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_011.wav|our subject matter was shaped by the facts of this century,
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_107.wav|We can only hope that it won't be long before all are allowed to do so.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_154.wav|The kind we're working for right now in Geneva.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_077.wav|Simply collecting agreements will not bring peace.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_124.wav|We must never do that again.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_083.wav|National security is government's first responsibility.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_082.wav|But that's before taxes.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_127.wav|Nothing has been so heartwarming to me as speaking to America's young, and the little ones especially, so fresh-faced and so eager to know.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_040.wav|And once they hit Juno Beach, they never looked back.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_035.wav|It is an uncontrolled fire.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_062.wav|Those who say that we are in a time when there are no heroes, they just don't know where to look.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_189.wav|Without resources diplomacy cannot succeed.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_242.wav|We seek neither military superiority nor political advantage.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_076.wav|And I do resort to prayer.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_237.wav|If paired with offensive systems, they can be viewed as fostering an aggressive policy, and no one wants that.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_070.wav|There are some who say that growth initiatives must await final action on deficit reductions.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_035.wav|Sorry, I'm a few minutes late as if he'd been delayed by a traffic jam.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_043.wav|In just six months, it has saved the taxpayers more than $2 billion and it's only getting started.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_032.wav|And certainly it was not wrong what we wished, and serious mistakes were trying, made in trying to do so.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_102.wav|But now the question, how do we keep the world moving toward the idea of popular government?
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_212.wav|Yes, we're in a time of recession.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_233.wav|We've seen a triumphant of our lives, the greatest of all our presidents, delivered his second state of the Union message in this chamber.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_066.wav|I know that over the recess in some informal polling, some of your constituents have been asked which they'd rather have, a balanced budget or a tax cut.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_180.wav|And now China is opening up its economy to meet its needs.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_022.wav|Through compromise and cooperation, the members of the commission overcame their differences and achieved a fair, workable plan.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_077.wav|Raising taxes won't balance the budget.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_209.wav|The truth of our great civilized ideas, individual liberty, representative government, the rule of law under God.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_079.wav|It must be prudent.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_179.wav|Congress alone, for example, has the power of purse.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_127.wav|But there are two sides to a compromise.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_098.wav|We have already taken actions to counter unfair trading practices to pry open closed foreign markets.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_140.wav|I am simply saying that I believe that that's where the effort should be directed to make that determination.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_046.wav|Much has been said about my management style, a style that's worked successfully for me during eight years as Governor of California and for most of my presidency.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_129.wav|There are some I know in your society who fear that change will bring only disruption and discontinuity, who fear to embrace the hope of the future.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_088.wav|The Soviets are now at the negotiating table and I think it's fair to say that without our planned deployments they wouldn't be there.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_019.wav|for now is not the time for talk alone.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_132.wav|The need for a truly effective and verifiable chemical weapons agreement has been highlighted by recent events.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_097.wav|I tell you from my heart that we in the United States do not want war.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_087.wav|You know, we only have a military industrial complex until a time of danger, and then it becomes the arsenal of democracy.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_170.wav|We are spending now 37% more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_027.wav|Chancellor Coral, you and your countrymen have made real the renewal that had to happen.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_109.wav|Our system is one of checks and balances.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_099.wav|And I tell you, we are ready to seize that beachhead.
wavs/reagan_1985_5_5_017.wav|Nor with all our compassion can we feel what the survivors feel to this day and what they will feel as long as they live.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_060.wav|This led to my failure to recollect whether I approved an arm shipment before or after the fact.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_034.wav|We will never be an aggressor.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_025.wav|As disappointed as I may be in some who serve me, I am still the one who must answer to the American people for this behavior.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_113.wav|These little images mark the present location, which would give them a range clear out into the Atlantic.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_056.wav|And let us not forget that the rest of the world is watching America carefully to see how we lack at this critical moment.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_135.wav|But within seconds a KGB detail pushed their way toward us and began pushing and shoving the people in the crowd.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_202.wav|Ten years ago, the young girl studied hard, learned English and finished high school in the top of her class.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_074.wav|Defense is not just another budget expense.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_065.wav|We won't know how my words tonight will be reported there for one simple reason.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_094.wav|The Soviet Union has produced 54,000 nearly five to one in their favor.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_142.wav|Because that's the way we are, this unique breed we call Americans.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_141.wav|The total amount flowing into this fund will be $28 billion a year.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_007.wav|Well, you know my name, and I think I'm an authoritative source on this since I'm right in the middle of what's going on here.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_185.wav|In such a world, more than ever, America needs strong and consistent leadership and the strength and resilience of the presidency are vital.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_041.wav|We didn't want, but we were charting a complete turnaround in government policy, and we did get the major part of what we proposed.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_085.wav|As a matter of fact, some 80 years ago, Teddy Roosevelt wrote these instructive words in his first message to the Congress.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_194.wav|Your self-determination and popular representative government possible.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_008.wav|At this special time of year we all renew our sense of wonder in recalling the story of the first Christmas in Bethlehem nearly two thousand years ago.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_093.wav|And we would be honored to sponsor summer youth exchanges, cultural events, and other programs for young Berliners from the East.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_016.wav|But we cannot compare labor management relations in the private sector with government.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_103.wav|I was happy with my career in the entertainment world, but I ultimately went into politics because I wanted to protect something precious.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_022.wav|We discussed nuclear arms and how to reduce them.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_062.wav|This means more money in the pool of investment capital.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_167.wav|Sometimes attempts are made to weaken my hand.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_073.wav|So we cut the people's tax rates and the people produced more than ever before.
wavs/reagan_1981_3_8_020.wav|Let me read the solemn oath taken by each of these employees, Miss Warren-Affed David, when they accepted their jobs.
wavs/reagan_1994_027.wav|I know the conference will send you back to your campuses better, informed, motivated, and trained.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_070.wav|They get plenty of input from the special interest groups.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_083.wav|In that court, the accused is innocent until proven guilty.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_001.wav|well thank you very much for that warm welcome.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_140.wav|I think he knows some of the things wrong with his society and is trying to fix them.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_080.wav|Yet in this age of redoubled economic growth, of information and innovation, the Soviet Union faces a choice.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_069.wav|I believe that we have a great interest in the Pacific Basin.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_099.wav|For me, there was a fork in the river, and it was right in the middle of my life.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_038.wav|Let's make this the best of eight.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_047.wav|and the Arab as well as other states.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_094.wav|It is the continuing revolution of the marketplace.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_157.wav|Quality recruitment and retention are up dramatically.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_042.wav|So as we begin, let us take inventory.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_024.wav|It was a notice that he no longer had a job.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_094.wav|We are moving ahead with grace commission reforms to eliminate waste and improve government's management practices.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_018.wav|We've grown used to the idea of space and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_006.wav|Every American would because this is, as we have been so eloquently told, one of democracy shrines.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_226.wav|But isn't it worth every investment necessary to free the world from the threat of nuclear war?
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_025.wav|It wasn't too much to call it un-American.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_028.wav|All of us together, in and out of government, must bear the burden.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_025.wav|History is no captive of some inevitable force.

wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_166.wav|Now we're building the B1.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_027.wav|Well, if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else?
wavs/reagan_1994_004.wav|Much has been achieved since Young America's foundations first conferences in 1979 and 1980.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_103.wav|The time has come to control the uncontrollable.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_143.wav|As is the tired, decent, cleaning woman who can't ride a subway home without being afraid.

wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_037.wav|I think understanding this fact has always made you patient with your younger cousins.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_082.wav|The dimensions of this failure are astounding, a country which employs one-fifth of its population and agriculture is unable to feed its own people.

wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_025.wav|We've just implemented the first and smallest phase of a three-year tax rate reduction designed to stimulate the economy and create jobs.
