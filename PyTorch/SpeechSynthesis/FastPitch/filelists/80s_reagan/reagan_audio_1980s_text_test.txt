wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_035.wav|It's been quite a journey this decade and we held together through some stormy seas.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_137.wav|Virtually every other revolution in history has just exchanged one set of rulers for another set of rulers.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_134.wav|Never has there been a more exciting time to be alive.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_143.wav|There were a number of things in there that we can that bill I can't go into detail about them here.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_130.wav|I've read the Constitution of a number of countries, including the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_016.wav|But it's not just students and presidents.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_106.wav|We the people tell the government what to do.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_102.wav|Central America and the Caribbean Basin.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_002.wav|We've been together eight years now and soon it'll be time for me to go.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_067.wav|Taken as a percentage of the gross national product, our defense spending happens to be only about four-fifths of what it was in 1970.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_091.wav|But yes, the summit itself was a good start, and now our byword must be, steady as we go.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_124.wav|Make no mistake about it.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_137.wav|That, however, can't be done without bringing great hardship down on many of our less fortunate neighbors who are not in a position to provide for themselves.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_119.wav|Around the world today, the Democratic revolution is gathering new strength.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_093.wav|And quick fixes don't fix big problems.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_038.wav|That just as truth can flourish only when the journalist is given freedom of speech.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_131.wav|Now some people are surprised to hear that they have a Constitution, and it even supposedly grants a number of freedoms to its people.
wavs/reagan_1981_27_7_064.wav|I outlined that program in an earlier broadcast, particularly the tax cut.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_049.wav|They seem to rise to their full capability and in the long run, you get more done.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_151.wav|Nowhere has this fundamental truth been more boldly and clearly stated than in the Helsinki Accords of 1975.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_016.wav|As you know, it's well stocked with criticisms, which I'll discuss in a moment, but I was very relieved to read this sentence.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_109.wav|We see it in the Renaissance in education, the rising SAT scores for three years.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_023.wav|It is doing so today by being magnificently unreconsiled to oppression.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_043.wav|The pain of war is still vivid in our national memory.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_017.wav|The future will be ours for the future belongs to the free.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_207.wav|The past year saw a change in Soviet leadership.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_036.wav|And drug abuse is not a so-called victimless crime.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_064.wav|I do not make this statement lightly or without serious reflection.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_193.wav|There must be a real incentive for the Soviets to take these talks seriously.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_027.wav|They were at the highest they'd been in 100 years with a prime rate that hit 21.5%.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_038.wav|And the unsurpassed courage of the Canadians who had already seen the horrors of war on this coast.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_027.wav|We are both instructing our negotiators to hasten their vital work and the world is waiting for the results.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_084.wav|And full implementation of all parts of the four-power agreement of 1971.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_031.wav|And all of this, with tough verification, an arms control area at which we've cooperated effectively over the years.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_001.wav|Mr. Secretary General,
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_161.wav|This reflects more than just better pay, equipment and leadership.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_044.wav|The meeting place rotates among the member countries.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_142.wav|What it all boils down to is this.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_063.wav|but I'm also determined to press ahead in the broader effort to achieve peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_081.wav|These warheads can reach their targets in a matter of a few minutes.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_171.wav|We are spending a third more on all of the programs of human service.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_169.wav|Our land-based missiles are increasingly threatened by the many huge new Soviet ICBMs.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_089.wav|In factories, farms and schools, in cities and towns around the globe, we, the people of the free world, stand as one with our Polish brothers and sisters.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_014.wav|Just 10 days ago, after months of debate and deadlock, the bipartisan commission on social security accomplished the seemingly impossible.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_069.wav|Their values sustain our national life.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_022.wav|These are the heroes who helped end a war.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_235.wav|Back over the years, citizens like ourselves have gathered within these walls when our nation was threatened.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_011.wav|And all others were referred to as the following respectable characters.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_155.wav|This administration has faith in state and local governments and the constitutional balance in vision to the founding fathers.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_001.wav|our assumptions about government and its place in our lives.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_128.wav|But it was a surprise to us because they outnumbered us 64 to 36 and submarines and 20% more bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles than we had.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_169.wav|And if all else failed, you could get a sense of patriotism from the popular culture.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_146.wav|The trust fund will start to phase out eventually to disappear and the excise taxes will be turned over to the states.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_136.wav|We ask only for a process, a direction, a basic code of decency, not for an instant transformation.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_182.wav|The fact is that in the past few decades, we have seen a dramatic shift in how we spend the taxpayers' dollar.
wavs/reagan_1984_6_6_048.wav|Well, what impelled you to put aside the instinct for self-preservation and risk your lives to take these cliffs?
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_008.wav|For an America of wisdom that honors the family, knowing that as the family goes, so goes our civilization.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_053.wav|But we must also salute those courageous leaders in the Congress who've made this day possible.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_148.wav|Human actions made the difference.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_092.wav|But freedom is more even than this.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_239.wav|Let it be said of us that we too did not fail.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_076.wav|We are witnessing today a great revolutionary crisis.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_143.wav|This practice contributes to distrust and fear about their intentions.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_106.wav|In February, our negotiating team in Geneva offered the Soviet Union a draft treaty on intermediate-range nuclear forces.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_016.wav|But it has taken place.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_050.wav|And tonight, I am instructing Treasury Secretary James Baker,
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_155.wav|At the back of that chair was painted the picture of a son on the horizon, and turning those sitting next to him.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_194.wav|This requires that we rebuild our defenses.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_122.wav|And yet we have the past few years forged to satisfy new closeless with the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1994_008.wav|American prestige was at an all time low and our leaders talked about an American malaise.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_056.wav|We are not, as some would have us believe, doomed to an inevitable decline.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_191.wav|This is why I'm speaking to you tonight.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_111.wav|Many senior citizens have been led to believe this is a new tax added on top of the present income tax.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_031.wav|Indeed, it must do the job.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_064.wav|For nearly a week now, I've been studying the Board's report.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_071.wav|In 1978 the Soviets had 600 intermediate-range nuclear missiles based on land and were beginning to add the SS-20.
wavs/reagan_1988_11_11_002.wav|remember today
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_023.wav|It was back in the early eighties at the height of the boat people.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_097.wav|Before the end of March, I will report to the Congress on all the steps I've taken in line with the Tower Board's conclusions.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_030.wav|We hear much of special interest groups.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_051.wav|And from my conversations with Allied leaders, I know that they also remain true to this tried and proven course.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_164.wav|There is a proposal before the Council of Europe to invite parliamentarians from democratic countries to a meeting next year in Strasbourg.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_097.wav|When action is required to preserve our national security, we will act.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_149.wav|You know they're Americans because their spirit is as big as the universe, and their hearts are bigger than their spirits.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_051.wav|We seek no superiority.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_179.wav|This adds up to a major effort, and it isn't cheap.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_081.wav|We remain opposed as ever to protectionism because America's growth and future depend on trade.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_136.wav|I will shortly send this Congress a message describing this program.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_209.wav|She helps them with love.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_066.wav|The first such increase in a long time.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_061.wav|I did approve it.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_042.wav|The Congress mandated spending cuts of $130 billion over three years, and adopted the biggest tax cut in history.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_155.wav|Better to see something once than to hear about it a hundred times.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_034.wav|Professionals, industrialists, shopkeepers, clerks, cabbys, and truck drivers.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_120.wav|Our policies consistently receive the strongest support of the late congressman Dan Daniel of Virginia.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_116.wav|I think that we've had something to do with that just as we have with the drug problem nationwide.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_107.wav|And I think this is something the American people see.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_065.wav|We must proceed with grace commission reforms against waste.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_016.wav|But first, let me say what the defense debate is not about.
wavs/reagan_1983_8_3_004.wav|Thank you for your prayers.
wavs/reagan_1992_17_8_055.wav|Some might believe that the things we've talked about tonight are irrelevant to the choice.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_128.wav|Based on a U.S. proposal, a committee has been formed to examine these issues as they relate to restrictions on nuclear testing.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_234.wav|We cannot escape history, Abraham Lincoln warned.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_038.wav|We will not sit idly by if our interests or our friends in the Middle East are threatened, nor will we yield the terrorist blackmail.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_018.wav|In one direction it points toward Moscow.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_152.wav|Opt for land to be owned by the state instead of those who tell it.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_063.wav|Because one is the Middle East.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_039.wav|Together, we have cut the growth of new federal regulations nearly in half.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_214.wav|My friends, we did it.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_026.wav|Interest rates had gone into outer space.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_102.wav|Indeed, the United States dismantled the last such missile in Europe over 15 years ago.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_156.wav|I believe the time has come for all nations to act in a responsible spirit that doesn't threaten other states.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_131.wav|It's like that scene in the cowboy movie, Butch Cassidy in the Sundance Kid, which some here in Moscow recently had a chance to see.
wavs/reagan_1981_28_4_008.wav|As a matter of fact, as evidence of that, I have a letter with me.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_101.wav|Wasn't my intention when I was young.
wavs/reagan_1982_8_6_210.wav|Well, the task I've set forth will long outlive our own generation.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_106.wav|And here's what the totals look like.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_189.wav|No glory will ever be too great.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_032.wav|Because that's what it has to be in America in the 1980s.
wavs/reagan_1983_25_1_016.wav|I myself have been talking about this problem for almost 30 years.
wavs/reagan_1988_11_11_004.wav|today in honor of the dead
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_207.wav|Thank you, God bless you.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_007.wav|As you know, I've come to Moscow to meet with one of your most distinguished graduates.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_168.wav|Now we're building one Triton submarine a year.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_020.wav|Our military might was at its peak, and we alone had the ultimate weapon, the nuclear weapon, with the unquestioned ability to deliver it anywhere in the world.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_149.wav|It's time we restored domestic tranquility and we mean to do just that.
wavs/reagan_1984_7_10_039.wav|I don't believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding who's going to play tennis on the White House court.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_012.wav|Well, don't you believe that one either?
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_047.wav|Your schedule now requires that the budget resolution be passed by April 15th.
wavs/reagan_1982_16_8_113.wav|We've found that while the overwhelming majority of Americans faithfully report income from interest in dividends and pay taxes on it, some do not.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_026.wav|History is made by men and women of vision and courage.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_071.wav|That's the way the system should work.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_110.wav|Despite budget restraints, we will seek record funding for research and development.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_080.wav|Let me repeat, we need deeds, not words, to convince us of Soviet sincerity should they choose to join us on this path.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_170.wav|We're encouraged by the bipartisan initiative of the House and are hopeful of further progress as the Senate continues its deliberations.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_028.wav|Let's start with the part that is the most controversial.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_234.wav|Their safety and hours are won, and no change in technology can or will alter that reality.
wavs/reagan_1985_6_2_131.wav|We have room for these children.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_042.wav|The Soviets may have had other plans, but my friends there were a few things the Soviets didn't count on.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_033.wav|I have said a number of occasions exactly what I believe about the Soviet Union.
wavs/reagan_1987_4_3_047.wav|The way I work is to identify the problem, find the right individuals to do the job, and then let them go to it.
wavs/reagan_1986_22_10_057.wav|I feel like we've just played the world series of tax reform and the American people won.
wavs/reagan_1982_17_6_059.wav|Soviet aggression and support for violence around the world, if you wrote it, the confidence needed for arms negotiations.
wavs/reagan_1986_28_1_030.wav|We don't keep secrets and cover things up.
wavs/reagan_1988_31_5_019.wav|One of these chips has more computing power than a room full of old-style computers.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_235.wav|We must and shall continue to honor our commitments.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_058.wav|Finally, we discussed the barriers to communication between our societies.
wavs/reagan_1988_25_1_086.wav|Let's ensure that the federal government never again legislates against the family and the home.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_198.wav|Building a more peaceful world requires a sound strategy and the national resolve to back it up.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_024.wav|In this season of spring in 1945, the people of Berlin emerged from their air-raid shelters to find devastation.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_071.wav|But for me, it always seemed more like the great rediscovery, a rediscovery of our values and our common sense.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_049.wav|At the same time that we tried the policy of unilateral disarmament, of weakness, if you will.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_106.wav|This is the first time in our history that this ceremony has been held as you've been told on this west front of the Capitol.
wavs/reagan_1984_21_10_117.wav|In dealing with terrorist, yes, we want to retaliate.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_073.wav|The policies we have in place will reduce the deficits steadily, surely, and in time, completely.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_141.wav|We wish him well and we'll continue to work to make sure that the Soviet Union that eventually emerges from this process is a less threatening one.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_118.wav|I'm not a linguist, but I learned to say that much Russian and have used it in frequent meetings with Mr. Gorbachev.
wavs/reagan_1981_18_11_009.wav|They want the dignity of having some control over their individual lives, their destiny.
wavs/reagan_1986_14_9_017.wav|Tonight, I can report to you that we've made much progress.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_015.wav|And I want to offer hope for the future.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_189.wav|I urge all peace-loving peoples to join together on those days, to raise their voices, to speak and pray for freedom.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_031.wav|We have done well, but we cannot stop at the foothills when Everest beckons.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_135.wav|We also saw the construction of the Berlin Wall.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_147.wav|So there was nothing inevitable about all of this.
wavs/reagan_1987_12_6_036.wav|In West Germany and here in Berlin, there took place an economic miracle.
wavs/reagan_1985_21_11_063.wav|And let me, at this point, tell you what we agreed upon and what we didn't.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_001.wav|Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, distinguished members of the Congress, honored guests and fellow citizens.
wavs/reagan_1989_11_11_072.wav|Common sense told us that when you put a big tax on something, the people will produce less of it.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_044.wav|peace in Beirut is only a first step.
wavs/reagan_1987_21_7_109.wav|We must demand more of ourselves and our children by raising literacy levels dramatically by the year 2000.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_072.wav|Once we've made the hard choices, we should lock in our gains.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_026.wav|the international community has an obligation to assist the government of Lebanon in reasserting authority over all its territory.
wavs/reagan_1981_23_12_072.wav|We must be sure that every bit of food provided by America goes to the Polish people, not to their oppressors.
wavs/reagan_1982_26_1_213.wav|And as true, there's no quick fix as I said to instantly end the tragic pain of unemployment.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_072.wav|A new highly accurate mobile missile with three warheads.
wavs/reagan_1983_23_3_218.wav|It is that we embark on a program to counter the awesome Soviet missile threat with measures that are defensive.
wavs/reagan_1982_20_9_048.wav|Israel and Syria have both indicated that they have no territorial ambitions in Lebanon and are prepared to withdraw.
wavs/reagan_1988_16_12_110.wav|There's for all its reforms remains a one-party authoritarian system that institutionalizes the concentration of power.
wavs/reagan_1986_4_2_117.wav|We must also look to the condition of America's families.
wavs/reagan_1981_20_1_053.wav|The price for this freedom at times has been high, but we have never been unwilling to pay that price.
